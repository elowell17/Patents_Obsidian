# ¶ 15.01    Conditions Under 35 U.S.C. 119(a)-(d), 172, 386(a) and (b)

Applicant is advised of conditions as specified in **[35 U.S.C. 119(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302921.html)** -**[(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302921.html##d0e302947)**, **[172](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e304490313.html)**, **[386(a) and (b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//al_d225a2_27b56_2ab.html##al_d225a2_29a27_324)**. An application for a design patent for an invention filed in this country by any person who has, or whose legal representatives have previously filed an application for a design patent, or equivalent protection for the same design in a foreign country which offers similar privileges in the case of applications filed in the United States or in a WTO member country, or to citizens of the United States, shall have the same effect as the same application would have if filed in this country on the date on which the application for patent for the same invention was first filed in such foreign country, if the application in this country is filed within six (6) months from the earliest date on which such foreign application was filed. If the design application is filed within two months from the expiration of the six-month period and the delay was unintentional, the right of priority in the design application may be restored by filing a petition under **[37 CFR 1.55(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//plt_d0e319215.html##aia_d0e319333)**.

# ¶ 15.01.01    Conditions Under 35 U.S.C. 172 Not Met

The claim for priority under **[35 U.S.C. 119(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302921.html##d0e302926)** -**[(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302921.html##d0e302947)**, **[386(a) or (b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//al_d225a2_27b56_2ab.html##al_d225a2_29a27_324)**  to the **[1]** application is acknowledged, however, the claim for priority cannot be based on such application since it was filed more than six (6) months before the filing date of the subsequent application in the United States and no petition to restore the right of priority under **[37 CFR 1.55(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//plt_d0e319215.html##aia_d0e319333)**  has been granted. **[35 U.S.C 172](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e304490.html)**.

Applicant may wish to file a petition under **[37 CFR 1.55(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//plt_d0e319215.html##aia_d0e319333)**  to restore the right of priority if the subsequent application was filed within two months from the expiration of the six-month period and the delay was unintentional. A petition to restore the right of priority must include: (1) the priority claim under **[35 U.S.C. 119(a) - (d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302921.html)**, **[386(a) or (b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//al_d225a2_27b56_2ab.html##al_d225a2_29a27_324)**  in an application data sheet, identifying the foreign application to which priority is claimed, by specifying the application number, country (or intellectual property authority), day, month, and year of its filing (unless previously submitted); (2) the petition fee set forth in **[37 CFR 1.17(m)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//eff_20130320_d0e315199.html##eff_20130320_d0e315732)**; and (3) a statement that the delay in filing the subsequent application within the six-month period was unintentional. The petition to restore the right of priority must be filed in the subsequent application, or in the earliest nonprovisional application claiming benefit under **[35 U.S.C. 120](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e303023313.html)**, **[121](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e303040912.html)**, **[365(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e307034.html##d0e307053)**, or **[386(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//al_d225a2_27b56_2ab.html##al_d225a2_29a9c_1b3)**  to the subsequent application, if such subsequent application is not a nonprovisional application. The Director may require additional information where there is a question whether the delay was unintentional. The petition should be addressed to: Mail Stop Petition, Commissioner for Patents, P.O. Box 1450, Alexandria, Virginia, 22313-1450.

### Examiner Note:

In bracket 1, insert the name of the foreign country.

# ¶ 15.02    Claimed Foreign Priority, No Certified Copy Filed

Acknowledgment is made of applicant’s claim for foreign priority based on an application filed in **[1]** on **[2]**. It is noted, however, that applicant has not filed a certified copy of the **[3]** application as required by 37 CFR 1.55. In the case of a design application, the certified copy must be filed during the pendency of the application, unless filed with a petition under 37 CFR 1.55(g) together with the fee set forth in 37 CFR 1.17(g), that includes a showing of good and sufficient cause for the delay in filing the certified copy of the foreign application. If the certified copy of the foreign application is filed after the date the issue fee is paid, the patent will not include the priority claim unless corrected by a certificate of correction under 35 U.S.C. 255 and 37 CFR 1.323.

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 1, insert the name of the country or intellectual property authority.

2. In bracket 2, insert the filing date of the foreign application.

3. In bracket 3, insert the application number of the foreign application.

# ¶ 15.03    Certified Copy Filed, But Proper Claim Not Made

Receipt is acknowledged of a certified copy of foreign application **[1]**. If this copy is being filed to obtain priority to the foreign filing date under 35 U.S.C. 119(a)-(d), 386(a) or (b), applicant should also file a claim for such priority as required by 35 U.S.C. 119(b). If the application was filed before September 16, 2012, the priority claim must be made in either the oath or declaration or in an application data sheet; if the application was filed on or after September 16, 2012, the claim for foreign priority must be presented in an application data sheet.

In the case of a design application, the claim for priority must be presented during the pendency of the application, unless filed with a petition under 37 CFR 1.55(e). If the claim for priority is filed after the date the issue fee is paid, the patent will not include the priority claim unless corrected by a certificate of correction under 35 U.S.C. 255 and 37 CFR 1.323.

### Examiner Note:

In bracket 1, insert the application number of the foreign application.

# ¶ 15.03.01.fti    Foreign Filing More Than 6 Months Before U.S. Filing, Application Filed Before March 16, 2013

Acknowledgment is made of the **[1]** application identified in the oath or declaration or application data sheet which was filed more than six months prior to the filing date of the present application. Applicant is reminded that if the **[2]** application matured into a form of patent protection before the filing date of the present application it would constitute a statutory bar to the issuance of a design patent in the United States under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302383.html##d0e302403)**  in view of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 172](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e304490.html)**.

### Examiner Note:

In brackets 1 and 2, insert the name of country where application was filed.

# ¶ 15.04    Priority Under Bilateral or Multilateral Treaties

The United States will recognize claims for the right of priority under **[35 U.S.C. 119(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302921.html)** -**[(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302921.html##d0e302947)**  based on applications filed under such bilateral or multilateral treaties as the Hague Agreement Concerning the International Deposit of Industrial Designs, the Benelux Designs Convention and European Community Design. In filing a claim for priority of a foreign application previously filed under such a treaty, certain information must be supplied to the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The required information is (1) the application number: (2) the date of filing of the application, and (3) the name and location of the national or international governmental authority which received such application.

# ¶ 15.05    Design Patent Specification Arrangement (Ch. 16 Design Application)

The following order or arrangement should be observed in framing a design patent specification:

- (1) Preamble, stating name of the applicant, title of the design, and a brief description of the nature and intended use of the article in which the design is embodied.
- (2) Cross-reference to related applications.
- (3) Statement regarding federally sponsored research or development.
- (4) Description of the figure or figures of the drawing.
- (5) Feature description.
- (6) A single claim.

### Examiner Note:

Do not use this form paragraph in an international design application.

# ¶ 15.05.01    Title of Design Invention

The title of a design must designate the name of the article in which the design is embodied or applied to. In addition, the title must correspond with the claim. See **[MPEP § 1503.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e150455.html)** and **[37 CFR 1.153](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//aia_d0e324221.html)**  or **[MPEP § 2920.04(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//ch2900_d24abc_1954d_155.html)** and **[37 CFR 1.1067](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//ar_d22557_20f6a_11c.html)**.

# ¶ 15.05.03    Drawing/Photograph Disclosure Objected To

The drawing/photograph disclosure is objected to because **[1].**

### Examiner Note:

In bracket 1, insert the reason for the objection.

# ¶ 15.05.04    Replacement Drawing Sheets Required

Corrected drawing sheets in compliance with **[37 CFR 1.121(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e323020.html##d0e323179)**  are required in reply to the Office action to avoid abandonment of the application. Any amended replacement drawing sheet should include all of the figures appearing on the immediate prior version of the sheet, even if only one figure is being amended. The figure or figure number of an amended drawing should not be labeled as amended. If a drawing figure is to be canceled, the appropriate figure must be removed from the replacement sheet, and where necessary, the remaining figures must be renumbered and appropriate changes made to the brief description of the several views of the drawings for consistency. Additional replacement sheets may be necessary to show the renumbering of the remaining figures. If all the figures on a drawing sheet are canceled, a replacement sheet is not required. A marked-up copy of the drawing sheet (labeled as "Annotated Sheet") including an annotation showing that all the figures on that drawing sheet have been canceled must be presented in the amendment or remarks section that explains the change to the drawings. Each drawing sheet submitted after the filing date of an application must be labeled in the top margin as either "Replacement Sheet" or "New Sheet" pursuant to **[37 CFR 1.121(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e323020.html##d0e323179)**  . If the changes are not accepted by the examiner, the applicant will be notified and informed of any required corrective action in the next Office action.

# ¶ 15.05.041    Color Drawing(s)/Photograph(s) Submitted

Color photographs or drawings have been submitted in this application. If replacement drawings are submitted, any showing of color in a black and white drawing is limited to the symbols used to line a surface to show color (**[MPEP § 608.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e47639.html)**) and must comply with the written description requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**. Additionally, lining entire surfaces of a design to show color(s) may interfere with a clear showing of the design as required by **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302824.html)**  because surface shading cannot be used simultaneously to define the contours of those surfaces. However, a surface may be partially lined for color with a description that the color extends across the entire surface; this technique would allow for the use of shading on the rest of the surface showing the contours of the design (**[37 CFR 1.152](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e324205.html)** ). In the alternative, a separate view, properly shaded to show the contours of the design but omitting the color(s), may be submitted if identified as shown only for clarity of illustration. Photographs and ink drawings are not permitted to be combined as drawings in one application.

In any drawing lined for color, the following descriptive statement must be inserted in the specification (the specific colors may be identified for clarity):

--The drawing is lined for color.--

However, some designs disclosed in color photographs/drawings cannot be depicted in black and white drawings lined for color. For example, a design may include multiple shades of a single color which cannot be accurately represented by the single symbol for a specific color. Or, the color may be a shade other than a true primary or secondary color as represented by the drafting symbols and lining the drawing with one of the drafting symbols would not be an exact representation of the design as originally disclosed.

### Examiner Note:

Use this form paragraph when color drawing(s) or photograph(s) have been submitted in an application.

# ¶ 15.05.05    Drawing Correction Required Prior to Appeal

Any appeal of the design claim must include the correction of the drawings approved by the examiner in accordance with _Ex parte Bevan_, 142 USPQ 284 (Bd. App. 1964).

### Examiner Note:

This form paragraph can be used in a FINAL rejection where an outstanding requirement for a drawing correction has not been satisfied.

# ¶ 15.07    Avoidance of New Matter

When preparing new or replacement drawings, be careful to avoid introducing new matter. New matter is prohibited by **[35 U.S.C. 132](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e303187.html)**  and **[37 CFR 1.121(f).](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e323020.html##d0e323200)** 

# ¶ 15.07.01    Statutory Basis, **[35 U.S.C. 171](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e304480.html)** 

The following is a quotation of **[35 U.S.C. 171](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e304480.html)**:

> - (a) IN GENERAL.—Whoever invents any new, original, and ornamental design for an article of manufacture may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions and requirements of this title.
> - (b) APPLICABILITY OF THIS TITLE.—The provisions of this title relating to patents for inventions shall apply to patents for designs, except as otherwise provided.
> - (c) FILING DATE.—The filing date of an application for patent for design shall be the date on which the specification as prescribed by section 112 and any required drawings are filed.

# ¶ 15.08    Lack of Ornamentality (Article Visible in End Use)

The claim is rejected under **[35 U.S.C. 171](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e304480.html)**  as being directed to nonstatutory subject matter in that it lacks ornamentality. To be patentable, a design must be "created for the purpose of ornamenting" the article in which it is embodied. See _In re Carletti,_ 328 F.2d 1020, 140 USPQ 653 (CCPA 1964).

The following evidence establishes a _prima facie_ case of a lack of ornamentality: **[1]**

Evidence that demonstrates the design is ornamental may be submitted from the applicant in the form of an affidavit or declaration under **[37 CFR 1.132](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e323552.html)**:

(a) stating the ornamental considerations which entered into the design of the article; and

(b) identifying what aspects of the design meet those considerations.

An affidavit or declaration under **[37 CFR 1.132](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e323552.html)**  may also be submitted from a representative of the company, which commissioned the design, to establish the ornamentality of the design by stating the motivating factors behind the creation of the design.

Attorney arguments are not a substitute for evidence to establish the ornamentality of the claim. _Ex parte Webb_, 30 USPQ2d 1064, 1067-68 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1993).

### Examiner Note:

In bracket 1, insert source of evidence of lack of ornamentality, for example, a utility patent, a brochure, a response to a letter of inquiry, etc.

# ¶ 15.08.01    Lack of Ornamentality (Article Not Visible in its Normal and Intended Use)

The claim is rejected under **[35 U.S.C. 171](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e304480.html)**  as being directed to nonstatutory subject matter in that the design lacks ornamentality since it appears there is no period in the commercial life of applicant’s **[1]** when its ornamentality may be a matter of concern. _In re Webb_, 916 F.2d 1553, 1558, 16 USPQ2d 1433, 1436 (Fed. Cir. 1990); _In re Stevens_, 173 F.2d 1015, 81 USPQ 362 (CCPA 1949).

The following evidence establishes a _prima facie_ case of lack of ornamentality: **[2]**

In order to overcome this rejection, two types of evidence are needed:

(1) Evidence to demonstrate there is some period in the commercial life of the article embodying the claimed design when its ornamentality is a matter of concern. Such evidence may include a showing of a period in the life of the design when the ornamentality of the article may be a matter of concern to a purchaser during the process of sale. An example of this type of evidence is a sample of sales literature such as an advertisement or a catalog sheet which presents the appearance of the article as ornamental and not merely as a means of identification or instruction; and

(2) Evidence to demonstrate the design is ornamental. This type of evidence should demonstrate "thought of ornament" in the design and should be presented in the form of an affidavit or declaration under 37 CFR 1.132 from the applicant:

(a) stating the ornamental considerations which entered into the design of the article; and

(b) identifying what aspects of the design meet those considerations.

An affidavit or declaration under **[37 CFR 1.132](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e323552.html)**  may also be submitted from a representative of the company, which commissioned the design, to establish the ornamentality of the design by stating the motivating factors behind the creation of the design.

Attorney arguments are not a substitute for evidence to establish the ornamentality of the claim. See _Ex parte Webb_, 30 USPQ2d 1064, 1067-68 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1993).

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 1, insert the name of the article in which the design is embodied.

2. In bracket 2, insert source of evidence of the article’s design being of no concern, for example, an analysis of a corresponding utility patent, a brochure, a response to a letter of inquiry, etc.

# ¶ 15.08.02    Simulation (Entire Article)

The claim is rejected under **[35 U.S.C. 171](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e304480.html)**  as being directed to nonstatutory subject matter in that the design lacks originality. The design is merely simulating **[1]** which applicant himself did not invent. See _In re Smith_, 25 USPQ 359, 1935 C.D. 565 (CCPA 1935); _In re Smith_, 25 USPQ 360, 1935 C.D. 573 (CCPA 1935); and _Bennage_ v. _Phillippi_, 1876 C.D. 135, 9 OG 1159.

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 1, insert the name of the article or person being simulated, e.g., the White House, Marilyn Monroe, an animal which is not stylized or caricatured in any way, a rock or shell to be used as paperweight, etc.

2. This form paragraph should be followed by form paragraph **[15.08.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//fp15.08.03.html)** when evidence has been cited to show the article or person being simulated.

# ¶ 15.08.03    Explanation of evidence cited in support of simulation rejection

Applicant’s design has in no way departed from the natural appearance of **[1]**. This reference is not relied on in this rejection but is supplied merely as representative of the usual or typical appearance of **[2]** in order that the claim may be compared to that which it is simulating.

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 1, insert name of article or person being simulated and source (patent, publication, etc.).

2. In bracket 2, insert name of article or person being simulated.

# ¶ 15.09    **[35 U.S.C. 171](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e304480.html)**  Rejection

The claim is rejected under **[35 U.S.C. 171](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e304480.html)**  as directed to nonstatutory subject matter because the design is not shown embodied in or applied to an article.

### Examiner Note:

This rejection should be used when the claim is directed to surface treatment which is not shown with an article in either full or broken lines.

# ¶ 15.09.01    Offensive Subject Matter

The disclosure, and therefore the claim in this application, is rejected as being offensive and therefore improper subject matter for design patent protection under **[35 U.S.C. 171](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e304480.html)**. Such subject matter does not meet the statutory requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 171](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e304480.html)**. Moreover, since **[37 CFR 1.3](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e313161.html)**  proscribes the presentation of papers which are lacking in decorum and courtesy, and this includes depictions of caricatures in the disclosure, drawings, and/or a claim which might reasonably be considered offensive, such subject matter as presented herein is deemed to be clearly contrary to **[37 CFR 1.3](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e313161.html)**. See **[MPEP § 608](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e42401.html)**.

# ¶ 15.09.02.aia    Statement of Statutory Bases, 35 U.S.C. 171 and 35 U.S.C. 115-Improper Inventorship

The following is a quotation of **[35 U.S.C. 171](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e304480.html)**:

(a) IN GENERAL.—Whoever invents any new, original, and ornamental design for an article of manufacture may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions and requirements of this title.

(b) APPLICABILITY OF THIS TITLE.—The provisions of this title relating to patents for inventions shall apply to patents for designs, except as otherwise provided.

(c) FILING DATE.—The filing date of an application for patent for design shall be the date on which the specification as prescribed by section 112 and any required drawings are filed.

**[35 U.S.C. 115(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302875912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae82_81)**  reads as follows (in part):

# ¶ 15.19.01    Summary Statement of Rejections

The claim stands rejected under **[1]**.

### Examiner Note:

1. Use as summary statement of rejection(s) in Office action.

2. In bracket 1, insert appropriate basis for rejection, i.e., statutory provisions, etc.

# ¶ 15.19.02.aia    Preface 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)/103 rejection - Different inventors, common assignee, obvious designs, no evidence of common ownership not later than effective filing date of claimed design

The claim is directed to a design not patentably distinct from the design of commonly assigned **[1]**. Specifically, the claimed design is different from the one in **[2]** in that **[3]**. These differences are considered obvious and do not patentably distinguish the overall appearance of the claimed design over the design in **[4]**.

The commonly assigned **[5]**, discussed above, names another inventor and has an earlier effectively filed date. Therefore, it qualifies as prior art under 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2) and would form the basis for a rejection of the claimed design in the present application under 35 U.S.C. 103 if the claimed design and the designed disclosed were not commonly owned not later than the effective filing date of the claimed design under examination.

This rejection under 35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)/103 might be overcome by: (1) a showing under 37 CFR 1.130(a) that the design in the reference was obtained directly or indirectly from the inventor or a joint inventor of this application and is thus not prior art under 35 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(A); (2) perfecting a claim to priority under 35 U.S.C. 119 that antedates the reference by filing a certified priority document in the application that satisfies the enablement and description requirements of 35 U.S.C. 112(a); (3) perfecting the benefit claim under 35 U.S.C. 120 by filing an application data sheet under 37 CFR 1.76 which contains a specific reference to a prior application in accordance with 37 CFR 1.78 and establishing that the prior application satisfies the enablement and description requirements of 35 U.S.C. 112(a); (4) a showing under 37 CFR 1.130(b) of a prior public disclosure under 35 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(B); or (5) providing a statement pursuant to 35 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(C) that the design disclosed and the claimed design, not later than the effective filing date of the claimed design, were owned by the same person or subject to an obligation of assignment to the same person or subject to a joint research agreement.

### Examiner Note:

1. A nonstatutory double patenting rejection may also be included in the action.

2. In brackets 1, 2, 4 and 5, insert "patent" and number, or "copending application" and serial number.

3. In bracket 3, identify differences between design claimed in present application and that claimed in earlier-filed patent or copending application.

4. This form paragraph should only be used ONCE in an Office action.

5. For applications claiming priority to, or the benefit of, an application filed before March 16, 2013, this form paragraph must be preceded by form paragraphs 15.10.aia and 15.10.15.

# ¶ 15.19.02.fti    Preface pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(e)/103(a) rejection - Different inventors, common assignee, obvious designs, no evidence of common ownership at time later design was made

The claim is directed to a design not patentably distinct from the design of commonly assigned **[1]**. Specifically, the claimed design is different from the one in **[2]** in that **[3]**. These differences are considered obvious and do not patentably distinguish the overall appearance of the claimed design over the design in **[4]**.

The commonly assigned **[5]**, discussed above, has a different inventive entity from the present application. Therefore, it qualifies as prior art under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302383.html##d0e302407)**, **[(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302383.html##d0e302420)**  or **[(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302383.html##d0e302424)**  and forms the basis for a rejection of the claim in the present application under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302450.html##d0e302455)**  if the conflicting design claims were not commonly owned at the time the design in this application was made. In order to resolve this issue, the applicant, assignee or attorney of record can state that the conflicting designs were commonly owned at the time the design in this application was made, or the assignee can name the prior inventor of the conflicting subject matter.

A showing that the designs were commonly owned at the time the design in this application was made will overcome a rejection under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302450.html##d0e302455)**  based upon the commonly assigned case as a reference under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302383.html##d0e302420)**  or **[35 U.S.C. 102(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302383.html##d0e302424)**, or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302383.html##d0e302407)**  for applications filed on or after November 29, 1999.

### Examiner Note:

1. This form paragraph should be used when the application being examined is commonly assigned with a conflicting application or patent, but there is no indication that they were commonly assigned at the time the invention was actually made.

2. If the conflicting claim is in a patent with an earlier U.S. filing date, a rejection under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302383.html##d0e302407)** /**[35 U.S.C. 103(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302450.html##d0e302455)**  should be made.

3. If the conflicting claim is in a commonly assigned, copending application with an earlier filing date, a provisional rejection under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302383.html##d0e302407)** /**[35 U.S.C. 103(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302450.html##d0e302455)**  should be made.

For applications with an actual filing date on or after March 16, 2013, that claim priority to, or the benefit of, an application filed before March 16, 2013, this form paragraph must be preceded by form paragraph **[15.10.15](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//fp15.10.15.html)**.

# ¶ 15.19.04.fti    Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(e)/103(a) Provisional Rejection - design claimed in an earlier-filed design patent application with common inventor and/or assignee

The claim is provisionally rejected under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302450.html##d0e302455)**  as being obvious over the claim in copending Design Patent Application No. **[1]** which has a common **[2]** with the instant application. Based upon the different inventive entity and the **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302383.html##d0e302407)**  date of the copending application, it would constitute prior art if patented. This provisional rejection under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302450.html##d0e302455)**  is based upon a presumption of future patenting of the conflicting application.

Although the invention is not identically disclosed or described as set forth in **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302383.html)**, if the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains, the invention is not patentable.

**[3]**

Since the design claimed in the present application is not patentably distinct from the design claimed in the **[4]** application, this provisional rejection may be overcome by merging the two applications into a single continuation-in-part and abandoning the separate parent applications. For applications filed on or after November 29, 1999, this rejection might also be overcome by showing that the subject matter of the reference and the claimed invention were, at the time the invention was made, owned by the same person or subject to an obligation of assignment to the same person. See **[MPEP § 2146](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e213206.html)** et seq.

Although the invention is not identically disclosed or described as set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302383.html)**, if the differences between the subject matter sought to be patented and the prior art are such that the subject matter as a whole would have been obvious at the time the invention was made to a designer having ordinary skill in the art to which said subject matter pertains, the invention is not patentable.

**[2]**

Since the design claimed in the present application is not the same invention claimed in the **[3]** patent, this rejection may be overcome by a showing under **[37 CFR 1.132](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e323552.html)**  that the design in the reference was derived from the designer of this application and is thus not the invention " by another," or by a showing of a date of invention for the instant application prior to the **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302383.html##d0e302407)**  date of the reference under **[37 CFR 1.131(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//aia_d0e323504.html##aia_d0e323512)**.

# ¶ 15.20.02    Suggestion To Overcome Rejection Under 35 U.S.C. 112(a) and (b) or pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112, First and Second Paragraphs (Ch. 16 Design Application)

Applicant may disclaim the areas or portions of the design which are considered indefinite and nonenabling in the rejection under 35 U.S.C. 112 above by converting them to broken lines and amend the specification to include a statement that the portions of the **[1]** shown in broken lines form no part of the claimed design.

### Examiner Note:

1. For international design applications, use form paragraph 29.27 instead.

2. In bracket 1, insert title of the article.

# ¶ 15.21    Rejection, 35 U.S.C. 112(a) and (b) or pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112, First And Second Paragraphs

The claim is rejected under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**  and **[(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302824.html)**, first and second paragraphs, as the claimed invention is not described in such full, clear, concise and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to make and use the same, and fails to particularly point out and distinctly claim the subject matter which the inventor or a joint inventor (or, for applications subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302824.html)**, the applicant) regards as the invention.

The claim is indefinite and nonenabling **[1]**.

### Examiner Note:

1. This form paragraph should not be used when it is appropriate to make one or more separate rejections under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**  and/or **[(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302824.html)**, first and/or second paragraph(s).

2. In bracket 1, a complete explanation of the basis for the rejection should be provided.

# ¶ 15.21.01    Rejection, 35 U.S.C. 112(b) or pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112, (Second Paragraph) (Additional Information Requested)

The claim is rejected for failing to particularly point out and distinctly claim the invention as required in **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302824.html)**, second paragraph. The title of the article in which the design is embodied or applied is too ambiguous and therefore indefinite for the examiner to make a proper examination of the claim under **[37 CFR 1.104](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e322124.html)**.

Applicant is therefore requested to provide a sufficient explanation of the nature and intended use of the article in which the claimed design is embodied or applied. See **[MPEP § 1503.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e150455.html)**. Additional information, if available, regarding analogous fields of search, pertinent prior art, advertising brochures and the filing of copending utility applications would also prove helpful. If a utility application has been filed, please furnish its application number.

This information should be submitted in the form of a separate paper, and should not be inserted in the specification (**[37 CFR 1.56](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e319407.html)** ). See also **[37 CFR 1.97](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e321609.html)**  and **[1.98](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e321738.html)**.

# ¶ 15.22    Rejection, 35 U.S.C. 112(b) or pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112, 2nd Paragraph

The claim is rejected under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302824.html)**, second paragraph, as being indefinite for failing to particularly point out and distinctly claim the subject matter which the inventor or a joint inventor (or, for applications subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302824.html)**, the applicant) regards as the invention.

The claim is indefinite **[1]**.

### Examiner Note:

1. Use this form paragraph when the scope of the claimed design cannot be determined.

2. In bracket 1, provide a full explanation of the basis for the rejection.

# ¶ 15.22.02    Rejection, 35 U.S.C. 112(b) or pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112, 2nd Paragraph ("Or the Like" In Claim)

The claim is rejected under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302824.html)**, second paragraph, as being indefinite for failing to particularly point out and distinctly claim the subject matter which the inventor or a joint inventor (or, for applications subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302824.html)**, the applicant) regards as the invention. The claim is indefinite because of the use of the phrase "**[1]**" following the title. Cancellation of said phrase in the claim and each occurrence of the title throughout the papers, except the oath or declaration, will overcome the rejection. See _Ex parte Pappas_, 23 USPQ2d 1636 (Bd. App. & Inter. 1992) and **[37 CFR 1.153](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e324221.html)**.

### Examiner Note:

1. This rejection should be used where there is another rejection in the Office action. For issue with an examiner’s amendment, see form paragraph **[15.69.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//fp15.69.01.html)**.

2. In bracket 1, insert --or the like-- or --or similar article--.

3. This form paragraph should not be used when "or the like" or "or similar article" in the title is directed to the environment of the article embodying the design.

# ¶ 15.22.03    Rejection, 35 U.S.C. 112(b) or pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112, Second Paragraph (Title Fails to Specify a Known Article of Manufacture)

The claim is rejected under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302824.html)**, second paragraph, as indefinite in that the title, as set forth in the claim, fails to identify an article of manufacture and the drawing disclosure does not inherently identify the article in which the design is embodied. _Ex parte Strijland_, 26 USPQ2d 1259, 1263 (Bd. Pat. App. & Int. 1992). Therefore, any attempt to clarify the title by specifying the article in which the design is embodied may introduce new matter. See **[35 U.S.C. 132](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e303187.html)**  and **[37 CFR 1.121](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e323020.html)**.

# ¶ 15.23    **[35 U.S.C. 171](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e304480.html)**  Double Patenting Rejection (Design-Design)

The claim is rejected under **[35 U.S.C. 171](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e304480.html)**  on the ground of double patenting since it is claiming the same design as that claimed in United States Design Patent No. **[1]**.

### Examiner Note:

Form paragraph **[15.23.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//fp15.23.02.html)** should follow all "same invention" type double patenting rejections.

# ¶ 15.23.01    **[35 U.S.C. 171](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e304480.html)**  Provisional Double Patenting Rejection (Design-Design)

The claim is provisionally rejected under **[35 U.S.C. 171](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e304480.html)**  on the ground of double patenting since it is claiming the same design as that claimed in copending Application No. **[1]**. This is a provisional double patenting rejection since the conflicting claims have not in fact been patented.

### Examiner Note:

Form paragraph **[15.23.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//fp15.23.02.html)** should follow all "same invention" type double patenting rejections.

# ¶ 15.23.02    Summary for "Same Invention" – Type Double Patenting Rejections

Applicant is advised that a terminal disclaimer may not be used to overcome a "same invention" type double patenting rejection. _In re Thorington_, 418 F.2d 528, 163 USPQ 644 (CCPA 1969); **[MPEP § 804.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e101356.html)**.

### Examiner Note:

This form paragraph should follow all "same invention" type double patenting rejections.

# ¶ 15.24    Nonstatutory Double Patenting Rejection (Single Reference)

The claim is rejected on the ground of nonstatutory double patenting of the claim in United States Patent No. **[1]**. Although the conflicting claims are not identical, they are not patentably distinct from each other because **[2]**.

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 1, insert prior U.S. Patent Number.

2. In bracket 2, the differences between the conflicting claims must be identified and indicated as being minor and not distinguishing the overall appearance of one over the other.

3. This form paragraph must be preceded by form paragraph **[15.24.06](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//fp15.24.06.html)** and followed by form paragraph **[15.67](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//fp15.67.html)**.

# ¶ 15.24.03    Provisional Nonstatutory Double Patenting Rejection (Single Reference)

The claim is provisionally rejected on the grounds of nonstatutory double patenting of the claim of copending Application No. **[1]**. Although the conflicting claims are not identical, they are not patentably distinct from each other because **[2]**. This is a provisional nonstatutory double patenting rejection because the conflicting claims have not in fact been patented.

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 1, insert conflicting application number.

2. In bracket 2, the differences between the conflicting claims must be identified and indicated as being minor and not distinguishing the overall appearance of one over the other.

3. This form paragraph must be preceded by form paragraph **[15.24.06](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//fp15.24.06.html)** and followed by form paragraph **[15.67](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//fp15.67.html)**.

# ¶ 15.24.04    Provisional Nonstatutory Double Patenting Rejection (Multiple References)

The claim is provisionally rejected on the grounds of nonstatutory double patenting of the claim of copending Application No. **[1]** in view of **[2]**. At the time applicant made the design, it would have been obvious to a designer of ordinary skill in the art to **[3]** as demonstrated by **[4]**. This is a provisional nonstatutory double patenting rejection because the conflicting claims have not in fact been patented.

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 1, insert conflicting application number.

2. In bracket 2, insert secondary reference(s).

3. In bracket 3, insert an explanation of how the conflicting claim in the copending application is modified.

4. In bracket 4, identify the secondary reference(s) teaching the modification(s).

5. This form paragraph must be preceded by form paragraph **[15.24.06](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//fp15.24.06.html)** and followed by form paragraph **[15.68.](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//fp15.68.html)**

# ¶ 15.24.05.fti    Identical Claim: Common Assignee

The claim is directed to the same invention as that of the claim of commonly assigned copending Application No. **[1]**. The issue of priority under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302383.html)**  and possibly **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302383.html)**  of this single invention must be resolved. Since the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office normally will not institute an interference between applications or a patent and an application of common ownership (see **[MPEP § 2302](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e238168.html)**), the assignee is required to state which entity is the prior inventor of the conflicting subject matter. A terminal disclaimer has no effect in this situation since the basis for refusing more than one patent is priority of invention under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C.102(f) or (g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302383.html)**  and not an extension of monopoly. Failure to comply with this requirement will result in a holding of abandonment of this application.

# ¶ 15.24.06    Basis for Nonstatutory Double Patenting, "Heading Only"

The nonstatutory double patenting rejection is based on a judicially created doctrine grounded in public policy (a policy reflected in the statute) so as to prevent the unjustified or improper timewise extension of the "right to exclude" granted by a patent and to prevent possible harassment by multiple assignees. See _In re Goodman_, 11 F.3d 1046, 29 USPQ2d 2010 (Fed. Cir. 1993); _In re Longi_, 759 F.2d 887, 225 USPQ 645 (Fed. Cir. 1985); _In re Van Ornum_, 686 F.2d 937, 214 USPQ 761 (CCPA 1982); _In re Vogel_, 422 F.2d 438, 164 USPQ 619 (CCPA 1970); and _In re Thorington,_ 418 F.2d 528, 163 USPQ 644 (CCPA 1969).

A timely filed terminal disclaimer in compliance with **[37 CFR 1.321(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e326459.html)**  may be used to overcome an actual or provisional rejection based on a nonstatutory double patenting ground provided the conflicting application or patent is shown to be commonly owned with this application. See **[37 CFR 1.131(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//aia_d0e323504.html##ar_d1fc99_2983e_8a)**. A terminal disclaimer must be signed in compliance with **[37 CFR 1.321(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//aia_d0e326459.html##aia_d0e326493)**.

The filing of a terminal disclaimer by itself **is not a complete reply** to a nonstatutory double patenting (NSDP) rejection. A complete reply requires that the terminal disclaimer be accompanied by a reply requesting reconsideration of the prior Office action. Even where the NSDP rejection is provisional, the reply must be complete. **[MPEP § 804](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e98894.html)**, subsection I.B.1. For a reply to a non-final Office action, see **[37 CFR 1.111(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e322449.html##d0e322457)**. For a reply to final Office action, see **[37 CFR 1.113(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e322575.html##d0e322618)**. A request for reconsideration while not provided for in **[37 CFR 1.113(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e322575.html##d0e322618)**  may be filed after final for consideration. See **[MPEP §§ 706.07(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e69716.html)** and **[714.13](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e88092.html)**.

The USPTO Internet website contains terminal disclaimer forms which may be used. Please visit **[www.uspto.gov/patent/patents-forms](https://www.uspto.gov/patent/patents-forms)**. The filing date of the application will determine what form should be used. A web-based eTerminal Disclaimer may be filled out completely online using web-screens.

### Examiner Note:

This form paragraph must precede all nonstatutory double patenting rejections as a heading, except "same invention" type.

# ¶ 15.24.07    Double Patenting Rejection (Design-Utility)

The claim is rejected under the judicially created doctrine of double patenting as being directed to the same invention as that set forth in claim **[1]** of United States Patent No. **[2]**. See _In re Thorington_, 418 F.2d 528,163 USPQ 644 (CCPA 1969).

### Examiner Note:

Form paragraph **[15.23.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//fp15.23.02.html)** should follow all "same invention" type double patenting rejections.

# ¶ 15.24.08    Provisional Double Patenting Rejection (Design-Utility)

The claim is provisionally rejected under the judicially created doctrine of double patenting as being directed to the same invention as that set forth in claim **[1]** of copending Application No. **[2]**. See _In re Thorington_, 418 F.2d 528,163 USPQ 644 (CCPA 1969).

This is a provisional double patenting rejection because the claims have not in fact been patented.

### Examiner Note:

Form paragraph **[15.23.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//fp15.23.02.html)** should follow all "same invention" type double patenting rejections.

# ¶ 15.25    Nonstatutory Double Patenting Rejection (Multiple References)

The claim is rejected on the grounds of nonstatutory double patenting of the claim(s) in United States Patent No. **[1]** in view of **[2]**. At the time applicant made the design, it would have been obvious to a designer of ordinary skill in the art to **[3]** as demonstrated by **[4]**.

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 1, insert conflicting patent number.

2. In bracket 2, insert secondary reference(s).

3. In bracket 3, insert an explanation of how the conflicting claim in the patent is modified.

4. In bracket 4, identify the secondary reference(s) teaching the modification(s).

5. This form paragraph must be preceded by form paragraph **[15.24.06](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//fp15.24.06.html)** and followed by form paragraph **[15.68](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//fp15.68.html)**.

# ¶ 15.26    Identification of Prior Application(s) in Nonprovisional Applications - Benefit Claimed

Applicant is reminded of the following requirement:

> To claim the benefit of a prior-filed application, a continuation or divisional application (other than a continued prosecution application filed under **[37 CFR 1.53(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e318681.html)** ), must include a specific reference to the prior-filed application in compliance with **[37 CFR 1.78](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//aia_d0e320662.html)**. If the application was filed before September 16, 2012, the specific reference must be included in the first sentence(s) of the specification following the title or in an application data sheet; if the application was filed on or after September 16, 2012, the specific reference must be included in an application data sheet. For benefit claims under **[35 U.S.C. 120](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e303023313.html)**, **[121](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e303040912.html)**, **[365(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e307034.html##d0e307053)**, or **[386(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//al_d225a2_27b56_2ab.html##al_d225a2_29a9c_1b3)**, the reference must include the relationship (i.e., continuation, divisional, or continuation-in-part) of the applications.

# ¶ 15.27    Restriction Under **[35 U.S.C. 121](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e303040.html)** 

This application discloses the following embodiments:

Embodiment 1 - Figs. **[1]**

Embodiment 2 - Figs. **[2]**

**[3]**

Multiple embodiments of a single inventive concept may be included in the same design application only if they are patentably indistinct. See _In re Rubinfield_, 270 F.2d 391, 123 USPQ 210 (CCPA 1959). Embodiments that are patentably distinct from one another do not constitute a single inventive concept and thus may not be included in the same design application. See _In re Platner_, 155 USPQ 222 (Comm’r Pat. 1967). The **[4]** create(s) patentably distinct designs.

Because of the differences identified, the embodiments are considered to either have overall appearances that are **not** basically the same, or if they are basically the same, the differences are **not** minor and patentably indistinct or are **not** shown to be obvious in view of analogous prior art.

The above embodiments divide into the following patentably distinct groups of designs:

This application discloses the following embodiments:

Embodiment 1 - Figs. **[1]**

Embodiment 2 - Figs. **[2]**

**[3]**

Multiple embodiments of a single inventive concept may be included in the same design application only if they are patentably indistinct. See _In re Rubinfield_, 270 F.2d 391, 123 USPQ 210 (CCPA 1959). Embodiments that are patentably distinct from one another do not constitute a single inventive concept and thus may not be included in the same design application. See _In re Platner_, 155 USPQ 222 (Comm’r Pat. 1967).

The above embodiments divide into the following patentably distinct groups of designs:

Group I: Embodiment **[4]**

Group II: Embodiment **[5]**

**[6]**

The embodiments disclosed within each group have overall appearances that are basically the same. Furthermore, the differences between them are considered minor and patentably indistinct, or are shown to be obvious in view analogous prior art cited. Therefore, they are considered by the examiner to be obvious variations of one another within the group. These embodiments thus comprise a single inventive concept and are grouped together. However, the **[7]** patentably distinguishes each group from the other(s).

Because of the differences identified, the embodiments of each Group are considered to either have overall appearances that are **not** basically the same, or if they are basically the same, the differences are **not** minor and patentably indistinct or are **not** shown to be obvious in view of analogous prior art.

Restriction is required under **[35 U.S.C. 121](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e303040.html)**  to one of the patentably distinct groups of the designs.

A reply to this requirement must include an election of a single group for prosecution on the merits, even if this requirement is traversed, **[37 CFR 1.143](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e324130.html)**. Any reply that does not include election of a single group will be held nonresponsive. Applicant is also requested to direct cancellation of all drawing figures and the corresponding descriptions which are directed to the nonelected groups.

Should applicant traverse this requirement on the grounds that the groups are not patentably distinct, applicant should present evidence or identify such evidence now of record showing the groups to be obvious variations of one another. If the groups are determined not to be patentably distinct and they remain in this application, any rejection of one group over prior art will apply equally to all other groups. See _Ex parte Appeal No. 315-40_, 152 USPQ 71 (Bd. App. 1965). No argument asserting patentability based on the differences between the groups will be considered once the groups have been determined to comprise a single inventive concept.

In view of the above requirement, action on the merits is deferred pending compliance with the requirement in accordance with _Ex parte Heckman_, 135 USPQ 229 (P.O. Super. Exam. 1960).

**[5]**

The above embodiments divide into the following patentably distinct groups of designs:

Group I: Embodiment **[6]**

Group II: Embodiment **[7]**

**[8]**

Group(s) **[9]** involve a difference in appearance. Multiple embodiments of a single inventive concept may be included in the same design application only if they are patentably indistinct. _In re Rubinfield_, 270 F.2d 391, 123 USPQ 210 (CCPA 1959). Embodiments that are patentably distinct from one another do not constitute a single inventive concept and thus may not be included in the same design application. _In re Platner_, 155 USPQ 222 (Comm’r Pat. 1967). The **[10]** creates patentably distinct designs.

Because of the differences identified, the embodiments are considered to either have overall appearances that are **not** basically the same, or if they are basically the same, the differences are **not** minor and patentably indistinct or are **not** shown to be obvious in view of analogous prior art.

Group(s) **[11]** directed to the combination(s) in relation to Group(s) **[12]** directed to the subcombination(s)/element(s). The designs as grouped are distinct from each other since under the law a design patent covers only the design disclosed as an entirety, and does not extend to patentably distinct segregable parts; the only way to protect such segregable parts is to apply for separate patents. _Ex parte Sanford_, 1914 C.D. 69, 204 OG 1346 (Comm’r Pat. 1914); _Blumcraft of Pittsburgh v. Ladd_, 238 F. Supp. 648, 144 USPQ 562 (D.D.C.1965). It is further noted that combination/subcombination subject matter, if patentably distinct, must be supported by separate claims, whereas only a single claim is permissible in a design patent application. _In re Rubinfield_, 270 F.2d 391, 123 USPQ 210 (CCPA 1959).

In any groups that include multiple embodiments, the embodiments are considered by the examiner to be obvious variations of one another within the group and, therefore, patentably indistinct. These embodiments thus comprise a single inventive concept and are grouped together.

Restriction is required under **[35 U.S.C. 121](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e303040.html)**  to one of the patentably distinct groups of designs.

A reply to this requirement must include an election of a single group for prosecution on the merits even if this requirement is traversed. **[37 CFR 1.143](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e324130.html)**. Any reply that does not include an election of a single group will be held nonresponsive. Applicant is also requested to direct cancellation of all drawing figures and the corresponding descriptions which are directed to the nonelected groups.

Should applicant traverse this requirement on the grounds that the groups are not patentably distinct, applicant should present evidence or identify such evidence now of record showing the groups to be obvious variations of one another. If the groups are determined not to be patentably distinct and they remain in this application, any rejection of one group over prior art will apply equally to all other groups. _Ex parte Appeal No. 315-40_, 152 USPQ 71 (Bd. App. 1965). No argument asserting patentability based on the differences between the groups will be considered once the groups have been determined to comprise a single inventive concept.

In view of the above requirement, action on the merits is deferred pending compliance with the requirement in accordance with _Ex parte Heckman_, 135 USPQ 229 (P.O. Super. Exam. 1960).

The designs as grouped are distinct from each other since under the law a design patent covers only the invention disclosed as an entirety, and does not extend to patentably distinct segregable parts; the only way to protect such segregable parts is to apply for separate patents. See _Ex parte Sanford_, 1914 CD 69, 204 OG 1346 (Comm’r Pat. 1914); and _Blumcraft of Pittsburgh_ v. _Ladd_, 238 F. Supp. 648, 144 USPQ 562 (D.D.C. 1965). It is further noted that patentably distinct combination/subcombination subject matter must be supported by separate claims, whereas only a single claim is permissible in a design patent application. See _In re Rubinfield_, 270 F.2d 391, 123 USPQ 210 (CCPA 1959).

**[9]**

Because the designs are distinct for the reason(s) given above, and have acquired separate status in the art, restriction for examination purposes as indicated is proper (**[35 U.S.C. 121](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e303040.html)** ).

A reply to this requirement must include an election of a single group for prosecution on the merits, even if this requirement is traversed. **[37 CFR 1.143](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e324130.html)**. Any reply that does not include an election of a single group will be held nonresponsive. Applicant is also requested to direct cancellation of all drawing figures and the corresponding descriptions which are directed to the nonelected groups.

Should applicant traverse this requirement on the grounds that the groups are not patentably distinct, applicant should present evidence or identify such evidence now of record showing the groups to be obvious variations of one another. If the groups are determined not to be patentably distinct and they remain in this application, any rejection of one group over the prior art will apply equally to all other groups. See _Ex parte Appeal No. 315-40_, 152 USPQ 71 (Bd. App. 1965). No argument asserting patentability based on the differences between the groups will be considered once the groups have been determined to comprise a single inventive concept.

In view of the above requirement, action on the merits is deferred pending compliance with the requirement in accordance with _Ex parte Heckman_, 135 USPQ 229 (P.O. Super. Exam. 1960).

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 5, add embodiments as necessary.

2. In bracket 8, add groups as necessary.

3. In bracket 9, add comments, if necessary.

# ¶ 15.30    Telephone Restriction Under 35 U.S.C. 121 (Segregable Parts or Combination/Subcombination)

This application discloses the following embodiments:

Embodiment 1 – Figs. **[1]** drawn to a **[2]**.

Embodiment 2 – Figs. **[3]** drawn to a **[4]**.

**[5]**

Restriction to one of the following inventions is required under **[35 U.S.C. 121](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e303040.html)**:

Group I – Embodiment **[6]**

Group II – Embodiment **[7]**

**[8]**

The designs as grouped are distinct from each other since under the law a design patent covers only the invention disclosed as an entirety, and does not extend to patentably distinct segregable parts; the only way to protect such segregable parts is to apply for separate patents. See _Ex parte Sanford_, 1914 CD 69, 204 OG 1346 (Comm’r Pat. 1914); and _Blumcraft of Pittsburgh_ v. _Ladd_, 238 F. Supp. 648, 144 USPQ 562 (D.D.C. 1965). It is further noted that patentably distinct combination/subcombination subject matter must be supported by separate claims, whereas only a single claim is permissible in a design patent application. See _In re Rubinfield_, 270 F.2d 391, 123 USPQ 210 (CCPA 1959).

**[9]**

During a telephone discussion with **[10]** on **[11]**, a provisional election was made **[12]** traverse to prosecute the invention of Group **[13]**. Affirmation of this election should be made by applicant in replying to this Office action.

Group **[14]** withdrawn from further consideration by the examiner, **[37 CFR 1.142(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e324111.html##d0e324123)**  as being for a nonelected invention.

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 5, add embodiments as necessary.

2. In bracket 8, add groups as necessary.

3. In bracket 9, insert additional comments, if necessary.

# ¶ 15.31    Provisional Election Required (**[37 CFR 1.143](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e324130.html)** )

Applicant is advised that the **reply** to be complete must include a provisional election of one of the enumerated designs, even though the requirement may be traversed (**[37 CFR 1.143](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e324130.html)** ).

# ¶ 15.33    Qualifying Statement To Be Used In Restriction When A Common Embodiment Is Included In More Than One Group

The common embodiment is included in more than a single group as it is patentably indistinct from the other embodiment(s) in those groups and to give applicant the broadest possible choices in the election. If the common embodiment is elected in this application, then applicant is advised that the common embodiment should not be included in any continuing application to avoid a rejection on the ground of double patenting under **[35 U.S.C. 171](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e304480.html)**  in the new application.

Group **[1]** withdrawn from further consideration by the examiner, **[37 CFR 1.142(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e324111.html)**, as being for a nonelected design, the requirement having been traversed in the reply filed on **[2]**.

# ¶ 15.35    Cancel Nonelected Design (Traverse)

The restriction requirement maintained in this application is or has been made final. Applicant must cancel Group **[1]** directed to the design(s) nonelected with traverse in the reply filed on **[2]**, or take other timely appropriate action (**[37 CFR 1.144](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e324143.html)** ).

# ¶ 15.36    Groups Withdrawn From Consideration Without Traverse

Group **[1]** withdrawn from further consideration by the examiner, **[37 CFR 1.142(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e324111.html)**, as being for the nonelected design. Election was made without traverse in the reply filed on **[2]**.

# ¶ 15.37    Cancellation of Nonelected Groups, No Traverse

In view of the fact that this application is in condition for allowance except for the presence of Group **[1]** directed to a design or designs nonelected without traverse in the reply filed on **[2]**, and without the right to petition, such Group(s) have been canceled.

# ¶ 15.38    Rejection Maintained

The arguments presented have been carefully considered, but are not persuasive that the rejection of the claim under **[1]** should be withdrawn.

3. See paragraphs in MPEP Chapter **[700](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e55397.html)**, for "Action is Final" and "Advisory after Final" paragraphs.

# ¶ 15.41    Functional, Structural Features Not Considered

Attention is directed to the fact that design patent applications are concerned solely with the ornamental appearance of an article of manufacture. The functional and/or structural features stressed by applicant in the papers are of no concern in design cases, and are neither permitted nor required. Function and structure fall under the realm of utility patent applications.

# ¶ 15.42    Visual Characteristics

The design for an article consists of the visual characteristics or aspect displayed by the article. It is the appearance presented by the article which creates an impression through the eye upon the mind of the observer.

# ¶ 15.43    Subject Matter of Design Patent

Since a design is manifested in appearance, the subject matter of a Design Patent may relate to the configuration or shape of an article, to the surface ornamentation on an article, or to both.

# ¶ 15.44    Design Inseparable From Article to Which Applied

Design is inseparable from the article to which it is applied, and cannot exist alone merely as a scheme of ornamentation. It must be a definite preconceived thing, capable of reproduction, and not merely the chance result of a method or of a combination of functional elements (35 U.S.C. 171; 35 U.S.C. 112(a) and (b) or pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112, first and second paragraphs). See _Blisscraft of Hollywood v. United Plastics Co._, 189 F. Supp. 333, 127 USPQ 452 (S.D.N.Y. 1960), 294 F.2d 694, 131 USPQ 55 (2d Cir. 1961).

# ¶ 15.46.01    Impermissible Descriptive Statement

The descriptive statement included in the specification is impermissible because **[1]**. See **[MPEP § 1503.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e150455.html)**, subsection II. Therefore, the description should be canceled as any description of the design in the specification, other than a brief description of the drawing, is generally not necessary, since as a general rule, the illustration in the drawing views is its own best description.

### Examiner Note:

In bracket 1, insert the reason why the descriptive statement is improper.

# ¶ 15.47    Characteristic Feature Statement

A "characteristic features" statement describing a particular feature of novelty or nonobviousness in the claimed design may be permissible in the specification. Such a statement should be in terms such as "The characteristic feature of the design resides in **[1]**," or if combined with one of the Figure descriptions, in terms such as "the characteristic feature of which resides in **[2]**." While consideration of the claim goes to the total or overall appearance, the use of a "characteristic feature" statement may serve later to limit the claim (_McGrady v. Aspenglas Corp.,_ 487 F. Supp. 859, 208 USPQ 242 (S.D.N.Y. 1980)).

### Examiner Note:

In brackets 1 and 2, insert brief but accurate description of the feature of novelty or nonobviousness of the claimed design.

# ¶ 15.47.01    Feature Statement Caution

The inclusion of a feature statement in the specification is noted. However, the patentability of the claimed design is not based on the specified feature but rather on a comparison of the _overall appearance_ of the design with the prior art. _In re Leslie_, 547 F.2d 116, 192 USPQ 427 (CCPA 1977).

# ¶ 15.48    Necessity for Good Drawings

The necessity for good drawings in a design patent application cannot be overemphasized. As the drawing constitutes the whole disclosure of the design, it is of utmost importance that it be so well executed both as to clarity of showing and completeness, that nothing regarding the design sought to be patented is left to conjecture. An insufficient drawing may be fatal to validity (**[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302824.html)**, first paragraph). Moreover, an insufficient drawing may have a negative effect with respect to the effective filing date of the claimed invention in a continuing application.

# ¶ 15.50    Use of Broken Lines for Indicating Unimportant Features Not Permitted

The ornamental design which is being claimed must be shown in solid lines in the drawing. Broken lines for the purpose of indicating unimportant or immaterial features of the design are not permitted. There are no portions of a claimed design which are immaterial or unimportant. See _In re Blum_, 374 F.2d 904, 153 USPQ 177 (CCPA 1967) and _In re Zahn_, 617 F.2d 261, 204 USPQ 988 (CCPA 1980).

# ¶ 15.50.01    Use of Broken Lines in Drawing (Ch. 16 Design Application)

Environmental structure may be illustrated by broken lines in the drawing if clearly designated as environment in the specification. See **[37 CFR 1.152](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e324205.html)**  and **[MPEP § 1503.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e151275.html)**, subsection III.

### Examiner Note:

Do not use this form paragraph in an international design application.

# ¶ 15.50.02    Description of Broken Lines (Ch. 16 Design Application)

A statement similar to the following should be used to describe the broken lines on the drawing (**[MPEP § 1503.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e151275.html)**, subsection III):

-- The broken line showing of **[1]** is for the purpose of illustrating **[2]** and forms no part of the claimed design. --

A statement similar to the one above **[3]** inserted in the specification preceding the claim.

### Examiner Note:

1. Do not use this form paragraph in an international design application.

2. In bracket 1, insert name of structure.

3. In bracket 2, insert --portions of the "article"-- or --environmental structure--.

4. In bracket 3, insert --must be-- or --has been--.

# ¶ 15.50.04    Proper Drawing Disclosure With Use of Broken Lines

Where superimposed broken lines showing environmental structure obscure the full line disclosure of the claimed design, a separate figure showing the broken lines must be included in the drawing in addition to the figures showing only claimed subject matter, **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302824.html)**, first paragraph.

# ¶ 15.50.05    Description of Broken Lines as Boundary of Design (Ch. 16 Design Application)

The following statement must be used to describe the broken line boundary of a design (**[MPEP § 1503.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e151275.html)**, subsection III):

--The **[1]** broken line(s) define the bounds of the claimed design and form no part thereof.--

### Examiner Note:

1. Do not use this form paragraph in an international design application.

2. In bracket 1 insert type of broken line, e.g. dashed or dot-dash or dot-dot-dash.

# ¶ 15.51    35 U.S.C. 112(a) Rejection (Written Description)

The claim is rejected under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**  as failing to comply with the written description requirement thereof since the **[1]** is not supported by the original disclosure. The original disclosure does not reasonably convey to a designer of ordinary skill in the art that the inventor was in possession of the design now claimed at the time the application was filed. See _In re Daniels_, 144 F.3d 1452, 46 USPQ2d 1788 (Fed. Cir. 1998); _In re Rasmussen_, 650 F.2d 1212, 211 USPQ 323 (CCPA 1981).

Specifically, there is no support in the original disclosure **[2]**.

To overcome this rejection, applicant may attempt to demonstrate (by means of argument or evidence) that the original disclosure establishes that the inventor had possession of the amended claim or **[3]**.

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 1, specify whether new drawing or amendment to the drawing, title or specification.

2. In bracket 2, specifically identify what subject matter is not supported so that the basis for the rejection is clear.

3. In bracket 3, insert specific suggestion how rejection may be overcome depending on the basis; such as, "the bracket in figures 3 and 4 of the new drawing may be corrected to correspond to the original drawing" or "the specification may be amended by deleting the descriptive statement."

# ¶ 15.51.01    Amendment to Disclosure Not Affecting Claim - **[35 U.S.C. 132](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e303187.html)**  Objection (New Matter)

The **[1]** is objected to under **[35 U.S.C. 132](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e303187.html)**  and **[37 CFR 1.121](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e323020.html)**  as introducing new matter. The original disclosure does not reasonably convey to a designer of ordinary skill in the art that the inventor was in possession of the amended subject matter at the time the application was filed. See _In re Rasmussen_, 650 F.2d 1212, 211 USPQ 323 (CCPA 1981).

Specifically, there is no support in the original disclosure **[2]**.

To overcome this objection, applicant may attempt to demonstrate (by means of argument or evidence) that the original disclosure establishes that the inventor had possession of the amended subject matter or **[3]**.

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 1, specify whether new drawing or amendment to the drawing, title or specification.

2. In bracket 2, specifically identify what is new matter so that the basis for the objection is clear.

3. In bracket 3, insert specific suggestion how the objection may be overcome depending on the basis; such as, "the broken line showing of environmental structure in Fig. 1 of the new drawing may be omitted to correspond to the original drawing" or "the title may be amended by deleting the reference to environmental structure."

# ¶ 15.55    Design Patent-Copyright Overlap

There is an area of overlap between Copyright and Design Patent Statutes where an author/inventor can secure both a Copyright and a Design Patent. Thus, an ornamental design may be copyrighted as a work of art and may also be the subject matter of a Design Patent. The author/inventor may not be required to elect between securing a copyright or a design patent. See _In re Yardley_, 493 F. 2d 1389, 181 USPQ 331 (CCPA 1974). In _Mazer v. Stein_, 347 U.S. 201, 100 USPQ 325 (U.S. 1954), the Supreme Court noted the election of protection doctrine but did not express any view on it since a Design Patent had been secured in the case and the issue was not before the Court.

It is the policy of the Patent and Trademark Office to permit the inclusion of a copyright notice in a Design Patent application, and thereby any patent issuing therefrom, under the following conditions:

- (1) A copyright notice must be placed adjacent to the copyright material and, therefore, may appear at any appropriate portion of the patent application disclosure including the drawing. However, if appearing on the drawing, the notice must be limited in print size from 1/8 inch to 1/4 inch and must be placed within the "sight" of the drawing immediately below the figure representing the copyright material. If placed on a drawing in conformance with these provisions, the examiner will not object to the notice as extraneous matter under **[37 CFR 1.84](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e320999.html)**.
- (2) The content of the copyright notice must be limited to only those elements required by law. For example, "© 1983 John Doe" would be legally sufficient under 17 U.S.C. 401 and properly limited.
- (3) Inclusion of a copyright notice will be permitted only if the following waiver is included at the beginning (preferably as the first paragraph) of the specification to be printed for the patent:
    
    > A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material to which a claim for copyright is made. The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but reserves all other copyrights whatsoever.
    
- (4) Inclusion of a copyright notice after a Notice of Allowance has been mailed will be permitted only if the criteria of **[37 CFR 1.312](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e326304.html)**  have been satisfied.

Any departure from these conditions may result in a refusal to permit the desired inclusion. If the waiver required under condition (3) above does not include the specific language "(t)he copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records...," the examiner will object to the copyright notice as improper.

# ¶ 15.55.01    Design Patent - Trademark Overlap

A design patent and a trademark may be obtained on the same subject matter. The Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, in _In re Mogen David Wine Corp._, 328 F.2d 925, 140 USPQ 575 (CCPA 1964), later reaffirmed by the same court at 372 F.2d 539, 152 USPQ 593 (CCPA 1967), has held that the underlying purpose and essence of patent rights are separate and distinct from those pertaining to trademarks, and that no right accruing from the one is dependent upon or conditioned by any right concomitant to the other.

# ¶ 15.58    Claimed Design Is Patentable (Ex parte Quayle Actions)

The claimed design is patentable over the references cited.

# ¶ 15.58.01    Claimed Design Is Patentable (35 U.S.C. 112 Rejections)

The claimed design is patentable over the references cited. However, a final determination of patentability will be made upon resolution of the above rejection.

# ¶ 15.59    Amend Title

For **[1]**, the title, and each occurrence of the language of the title, **[2]** amended throughout the application, original oath or declaration excepted, to read: **[3]**

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 1, insert reason.

2. In bracket 2, insert --should be-- or --has been--.

3. When the applicant has furnished the application title, applicant's authorization is required to make an examiner’s amendment to the application title. See **[MPEP § 1302.04](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e131704.html)**. Where the changes are made by examiner's amendment, this form paragraph should be preceded by form paragraphs **[13.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//fp13.02.html)** and **[13.02.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//fp13.02.01.html)**. If an extension of time is required, use form paragraph **[13.02.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//fp13.02.02.html)** instead of form paragraphs **[13.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//fp13.02.html)** and **[13.02.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//fp13.02.01.html)**.

# ¶ 15.60    Amend All Figure Descriptions

For **[1]**, the figure descriptions **[2]** amended to read: **[3]**

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 1, insert reason.

2. In bracket 2, insert --should be-- or --have been-.

### Examiner Note:

In bracket 1, identify the subject matter which is insufficiently disclosed.

# ¶ 15.66    Employ Services of Patent Attorney or Agent (Design Application Only)

As the value of a design patent is largely dependent upon the skillful preparation of the drawings and specification, applicant might consider it desirable to employ the services of a registered patent attorney or agent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office cannot aid in the selection of an attorney or agent.

A listing of registered patent attorneys and agents is available at **[https://oedci.uspto.gov/OEDCI/](https://oedci.uspto.gov/OEDCI/)**. Applicants may also obtain a list of registered patent attorneys and agents located in their area by writing to the Mail Stop OED, Director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, P.O. Box 1450, Alexandria, VA 22313-1450.

# ¶ 15.66.01    Employ Services of Professional Patent Draftsperson (Design Application Only)

As the value of a design patent is largely dependent upon the skillful preparation of the drawings, applicant might consider it desirable to employ the services of a professional patent draftsperson familiar with design practice. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office cannot aid in the selection of a draftsperson.

### Examiner Note:

This form paragraph should only be used in _pro se_ applications where it appears that patentable subject matter is present and the disclosure of the claimed design complies with the requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302824.html)**.

# ¶ 15.67    Rationale for 35 U.S.C. 103 Rejection (Single Reference)

It is well settled that it is unobviousness in the overall appearance of the claimed design, when compared with the prior art, rather than minute details or small variations in design as appears to be the case here, that constitutes the test of design patentability. See _In re Frick_, 275 F.2d 741, 125 USPQ 191 (CCPA 1960) and _In re Lamb_, 286 F.2d 610, 128 USPQ 539 (CCPA 1961).

# ¶ 15.68    Rationale for 35 U.S.C. 103 Rejection (Multiple References)

This modification of the primary reference in light of the secondary reference is proper because the applied references are so related that the appearance of features shown in one would suggest the application of those features to the other. See _In re Rosen_, 673 F.2d 388, 213 USPQ 347 (CCPA 1982); _In re Carter_, 673 F.2d 1378, 213 USPQ 625 (CCPA 1982), and _In re Glavas_, 230 F.2d 447, 109 USPQ 50 (CCPA 1956). Further, it is noted that case law has held that a designer skilled in the art is charged with knowledge of the related art; therefore, the combination of old elements, herein, would have been well within the level of ordinary skill. See _In re Antle_, 444 F.2d 1168,170 USPQ 285 (CCPA 1971) and _In re Nalbandian_, 661 F.2d 1214, 211 USPQ 782 (CCPA 1981).

# ¶ 15.69.01    Remove Indefinite Language ("Or The Like") by Examiner’s Amendment

The phrase **[1]** in the claim following the title renders the claim indefinite. By authorization of **[2]** in a telephone interview on **[3]**, the phrase has been cancelled from the claim and at each occurrence of the title throughout the papers, except the oath or declaration **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302824.html)**, second paragraph, and **[37 CFR 1.153](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e324221.html)** ). See _Ex parte Pappas_, 23 USPQ2d 1636 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1992).

### Examiner Note:

In bracket 1, insert objectionable phrase, e.g., --or the like--, --or similar article--, etc.

# ¶ 15.70.aia    Preface, 35 U.S.C. 103 Rejection

It would have been obvious to a designer of ordinary skill before the effective filing date of the present claimed invention to **[1]**.

### Examiner Note:

Insert explanation of the use of the reference applied in bracket 1.

# ¶ 15.70.fti    Preface, Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(a) Rejection

It would have been obvious to a designer of ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made to **[1]**.

### Examiner Note:

Insert explanation of the use of the reference applied in bracket 1.

# ¶ 15.72    Quayle Action

This application is in condition for allowance except for the following formal matters: **[1]**.

Prosecution on the merits is closed in accordance with the practice under _Ex parte Quayle_, 25 USPQ 74, 453 OG 213 (Comm'r Pat. 1935).

A shortened statutory period for reply to this action is set to expire **TWO (2) MONTHS** from the mailing date of this letter. Extensions of time may be granted under **[37 CFR 1.136](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e323655.html)**  but in no case can any extension carry the date for reply to this Office action beyond the maximum period of SIX MONTHS set by statute (**[35 U.S.C. 133](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e303207aia.html)** ).

# ¶ 15.73    Corrected Drawing Sheets Required

Failure to submit replacement correction sheets overcoming all of the deficiencies in the drawing disclosure set forth above, or an explanation why the drawing corrections or additional drawing views are not necessary will result in the rejection of the claim under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**  and **[(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302824.html)**, first and second paragraphs, being made FINAL in the next Office action.

# ¶ 15.74    Continuation-In-Part

Reference to this design application as a continuation-in-part under **[35 U.S.C. 120](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e303023313.html)**  is acknowledged. Unless the filing date of the earlier application is actually needed, such as to avoid intervening prior art, the entitlement to priority in this CIP application will not be considered. See _In re Corba_, 212 USPQ 825 (Comm’r Pat. 1981).

### Examiner Note:

This form paragraph should be used to notify applicant that the C-I-P application is not entitled to the benefit of the parent application under **[35 U.S.C. 120](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e303023313.html)**.

# ¶ 15.74.01    Continuation-In-Part – Not Entitled To Benefit of Earlier Filing Date

Reference to this design application as a continuation-in-part under **[35 U.S.C. 120](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e303023313.html)**  is acknowledged. Applicant is advised that the design claimed in the present application is not disclosed in the parent application. Therefore, the parent application does not satisfy the written description requirement of **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302824912.html)**, first paragraph, under **[35 U.S.C. 120](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e303023313.html)**  for the design claimed in the present application and the present application is not entitled to the benefit of the earlier filing date.

### Examiner Note:

This form paragraph should be used to notify applicant that the C-I-P application is not entitled to the benefit of the parent application under **[35 U.S.C. 120](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e303023313.html)**.

# ¶ 15.75.fti    Preface to Rejection in CIP Based on pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(d)/35 U.S.C.172

Reference to this design application as a continuation-in-part under **[35 U.S.C. 120](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e303023313.html)**  is acknowledged. Applicant is advised that the design disclosed in the parent application is not the same design as the design disclosed in this application. Therefore, this application does not satisfy the written description requirement of **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302824.html)**, first paragraph, under **[35 U.S.C. 120](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e303023313.html)**  and is not entitled to benefit of the earlier filing date.

The parent application claimed foreign priority under **[35 U.S.C. 119(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302921.html##d0e302926)**  -**[(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302921.html##d0e302947)**, however, the present application is not entitled to the benefit of the earlier filing date of the parent application. The foreign application that the parent application has claimed priority to has matured into a patent/registration before the filing date of the present application and was filed more than six months before the filing date of the present application. Therefore, the foreign patent/registration qualifies as prior art under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302383.html##d0e302403)** /**[35 U.S.C. 172](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e304490.html)**.

### Examiner Note:

This form paragraph should be followed with a rejection under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302383.html)** / **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302450.html)**  depending on the difference(s) between this claim and the design shown in the priority papers.

# ¶ 15.75.01.fti    C-I-P Caution, Claim to Foreign Priority in Earlier Filed Application - Status of Foreign Application Unknown

Reference to this application as a continuation-in-part under **[35 U.S.C. 120](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e303023313.html)**  is acknowledged. Applicant is advised that the design disclosed in the parent application is not the same design as the design disclosed in this application. Therefore, this application does not satisfy the written description requirement of **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302824.html)**, first paragraph, under **[35 U.S.C. 120](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e303023313.html)**  and is not entitled to benefit of the earlier filing date.

The parent application claimed foreign priority under **[35 U.S.C. 119(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302921.html##d0e302926)** -**[(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e302921.html##d0e302947)**. Applicant is reminded that if the foreign application to which priority was claimed matured into a patent/registration before the filing of the present application and was filed more than six months before the filing date of the present application, the foreign patent/registration qualifies as prior art under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//al_d1fbe1_234ed_52.html##al_d1d85b_11ecb_1d1)** /**[35 U.S.C. 172](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1500.html#//d0e304490.html)**.

**Therefore, Applicant is requested to inform the Office of the status of the foreign application to which priority is claimed.**

# ¶ 15.76    Trademark in Drawing

The **[1]** forming part of the claimed design is a registered trademark of **[2]**. The specification must be amended to include a statement preceding the claim identifying the trademark material forming part of the claimed design and the name of the owner of the trademark.

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 1, identify the trademark material.

2. In bracket 2, identify the trademark owner.

# ¶ 15.85    Undisclosed visible surface(s)/portion(s) of article not forming part of the claimed design

The **[1]** of the article **[2]** not shown in the drawing or described in the specification. It is understood that the appearance of any part of the article not shown in the drawing or described in the specification forms no part of the claimed design. _In re Zahn_, 617 F.2d 261, 204 USPQ 988 (CCPA 1980). Therefore, the determination of patentability is based on the design for the article shown and described.

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 1, insert surface or surfaces which are not shown.

2. In bracket 2, insert "is" or "are".

# ¶ 15.90    Indication of allowability withdrawn

The indication of allowability set forth in the previous action is withdrawn and prosecution is reopened in view of the following new ground of rejection.
