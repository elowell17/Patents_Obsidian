# ¶ 8.01    Election of Species; Species Claim(s) Present

This application contains claims directed to the following patentably distinct species **[1]**. The species are independent or distinct because **[2]**. In addition, these species are not obvious variants of each other based on the current record.

Applicant is required under **[35 U.S.C. 121](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e303040.html)**  to elect a single disclosed species, or a single grouping of patentably indistinct species, for prosecution on the merits to which the claims shall be restricted if no generic claim is finally held to be allowable. Currently, **[3]** generic.

There is a serious search and/or examination burden for the patentably distinct species as set forth above because at least the following reason(s) apply: **[4]**.

**Applicant is advised that the reply to this requirement to be complete must include (i) an election of a species to be examined** even though the requirement may be traversed (**[37 CFR 1.143](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e324130.html)** ) **and (ii) identification of the claims encompassing the elected species or grouping of patentably indistinct species**, including any claims subsequently added. An argument that a claim is allowable or that all claims are generic is considered nonresponsive unless accompanied by an election.

The election may be made with or without traverse. To preserve a right to petition, the election must be made with traverse. If the reply does not distinctly and specifically point out supposed errors in the election of species requirement, the election shall be treated as an election without traverse. Traversal must be presented at the time of election in order to be considered timely. Failure to timely traverse the requirement will result in the loss of right to petition under **[37 CFR 1.144](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e324143.html)**. If claims are added after the election, applicant must indicate which of these claims are readable on the elected species or grouping of patentably indistinct species.

Should applicant traverse on the ground that the species, or groupings of patentably indistinct species from which election is required, are not patentably distinct, applicant should submit evidence or identify such evidence now of record showing them to be obvious variants or clearly admit on the record that this is the case. In either instance, if the examiner finds one of the species unpatentable over the prior art, the evidence or admission may be used in a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//al_d1fbe1_19797_b0.html)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e302450.html##d0e302455)**  of the other species.

Upon the allowance of a generic claim, applicant will be entitled to consideration of claims to additional species which depend from or otherwise require all the limitations of an allowable generic claim as provided by **[37 CFR 1.141](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e324081.html)**.

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 1, identify the species and/or grouping(s) of patentably indistinct species from which an election is to be made. The species may be identified as the species of figures 1, 2, and 3, for example, or the species of examples I, II, and III, respectively. Where the election requirement identifies a grouping of patentably indistinct species, applicant should not be required to elect a specific species within that grouping.

2. In bracket 2 insert the reason(s) why the species or grouping(s) of species are independent or distinct. See **[MPEP § 806.04(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e103787.html)**, **[§ 806.04(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e103987.html)** and **[§ 806.04(h)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e104035.html)**. For example, insert --the claims to the different species recite the mutually exclusive characteristics of such species--, and provide a description of the mutually exclusive characteristics of each species or grouping of species.

3. In bracket 3 insert the appropriate generic claim information.

4. In bracket 4 insert the applicable reason(s) why there is a serious search and/or examination burden as listed below.

-For a serious search burden list one or more of the following:

--the species or groupings of patentably indistinct species have acquired a separate status in the art in view of their different classification;

--the species or groupings of patentably indistinct species have acquired a separate status in the art due to their recognized divergent subject matter; and/or

--the species or groupings of patentably indistinct species require a different field of search (e.g., searching different classes/subclasses or electronic resources, or employing different search strategies or search queries).

-For a serious examination burden explain the reason, such as non-prior art issues under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e302376.html)**, **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e302824.html)**, first paragraph, and/or **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**  are relevant to one species or grouping of patentably indistinct species that are not relevant to the other species or grouping(s) of patentably indistinct species.

5. This form paragraph does not need to be followed by form paragraph **[8.21](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//fp8.21.html)**.

# ¶ 8.02    Requiring an Election of Species; No Species Claim Present

Claim(s) **[1]** is/are generic to the following disclosed patentably distinct species: **[2]**. The species are independent or distinct because **[3]**. In addition, these species are not obvious variants of each other based on the current record.

Applicant is required under **[35 U.S.C. 121](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e303040.html)**  to elect a single disclosed species, or a single grouping of patentably indistinct species, for prosecution on the merits to which the claims shall be restricted if no generic claim is finally held to be allowable.

There is a serious search and/or examination burden for the patentably distinct species as set forth above because at least the following reason(s) apply: **[4]**

**Applicant is advised that the reply to this requirement to be complete must include (i) an election of a species or a grouping of patentably indistinct species to be examined** even though the requirement may be traversed **[(37 CFR 1.143](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e324130.html)** ) **and (ii) identification of the claims encompassing the elected species or grouping of patentably indistinct species**, including any claims subsequently added.

# ¶ 8.03    In Condition for Allowance, Non-elected Claims Withdrawn with Traverse

This application is in condition for allowance except for the presence of claim **[1]** directed to an invention non-elected with traverse in the reply filed on **[2]**. Applicant is given TWO MONTHS from the date of this letter to cancel the noted claims or take other appropriate action (**[37 CFR 1.144](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e324143.html)** ). Failure to take action during this period will be treated as authorization to cancel the noted claims by Examiner’s Amendment and pass the case to issue. Extensions of time under **[37 CFR 1.136(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e323655.html)**  will not be permitted since this application will be passed to issue.

The prosecution of this case is closed except for consideration of the above matter.

# ¶ 8.04    Election by Original Presentation

Newly submitted claim **[1]** directed to an invention that is independent or distinct from the invention originally claimed for the following reasons: **[2]**

Since applicant has received an action on the merits for the originally presented invention, this invention has been constructively elected by original presentation for prosecution on the merits. Accordingly, claim **[3]** withdrawn from consideration as being directed to a non-elected invention. See **[37 CFR 1.142(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e324111.html)**  and **[MPEP § 821.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e108405.html)**.

To preserve a right to petition, the reply to this action must distinctly and specifically point out supposed errors in the restriction requirement. Otherwise, the election shall be treated as a final election without traverse. Traversal must be timely. Failure to timely traverse the requirement will result in the loss of right to petition under 37 CFR 1.144. If claims are subsequently added, applicant must indicate which of the subsequently added claims are readable upon the elected invention.

Should applicant traverse on the ground that the inventions are not patentably distinct, applicant should submit evidence or identify such evidence now of record showing the inventions to be obvious variants or clearly admit on the record that this is the case. In either instance, if the examiner finds one of the inventions unpatentable over the prior art, the evidence or admission may be used in a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//al_d1fbe1_19797_b0.html)**  or pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(a) of the other invention.

### Examiner Note:

This form paragraph should be followed by one of form paragraphs **[8.14](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//fp8.14.html)**-**[8.20.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//fp8.20.02.html)** to show independence or distinctness.

# ¶ 8.14    Intermediate-Final Product

Inventions **[1]** and **[2]** are related as mutually exclusive species in an intermediate-final product relationship. Distinctness is proven for claims in this relationship if the intermediate product is useful to make other than the final product and the species are patentably distinct (**[MPEP § 806.05(j)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e105372.html)**). In the instant case, the intermediate product is deemed to be useful as **[3]** and the inventions are deemed patentably distinct because there is nothing of record to show them to be obvious variants.

### Examiner Note:

1. This form paragraph is to be used when claims are presented to both **an intermediate** and **final product** (**[MPEP § 806.05(j)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e105372.html)**).

2. Conclude restriction requirement with form paragraph **[8.21](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//fp8.21.html)**.

# ¶ 8.14.01    Distinct Products or Distinct Processes

Inventions **[1]** and **[2]** are directed to related **[3]**. The related inventions are distinct if: (1) the inventions as claimed are either not capable of use together or can have a materially different design, mode of operation, function, or effect; (2) the inventions do not overlap in scope, i.e., are mutually exclusive; and (3) the inventions as claimed are not obvious variants. See **[MPEP § 806.05(j)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e105372.html)**. In the instant case, the inventions as claimed **[4]**. Furthermore, the inventions as claimed do not encompass overlapping subject matter and there is nothing of record to show them to be obvious variants.

### Examiner Note:

1. This form paragraph may be used when claims are presented to two or more related product inventions, or two or more related process inventions, wherein the inventions as claimed are mutually exclusive, i.e., there is no product (or process) that would infringe both of the identified inventions. Use form paragraph **[8.15](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//fp8.15.html)** to restrict between combination(s) and subcombination(s).

2. If a generic claim or claim linking multiple product inventions or multiple process inventions is present, see **[MPEP § 809](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e105981.html)** - **[§ 809.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e106269.html)**.

3. In bracket 3, insert --products -- or --processes--.

4. In bracket 4, explain why the inventions as claimed are either not capable of use together or can have a materially different design, mode of operation, function, or effect.

5. Conclude restriction requirement with form paragraph **[8.21](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//fp8.21.html)**.

# ¶ 8.15    Combination-Subcombination

Inventions **[1]** and **[2]** are related as combination and subcombination. Inventions in this relationship are distinct if it can be shown that (1) the combination as claimed does not require the particulars of the subcombination as claimed for patentability, and (2) that the subcombination has utility by itself or in other combinations (**[MPEP § 806.05(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e104168.html)**). In the instant case, the combination as claimed does not require the particulars of the subcombination as claimed because **[3]**. The subcombination has separate utility such as **[4]**.

The examiner has required restriction between combination and subcombination inventions. Where applicant elects a subcombination, and claims thereto are subsequently found allowable, any claim(s) depending from or otherwise requiring all the limitations of the allowable subcombination will be examined for patentability in accordance with **[37 CFR 1.104](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e322124.html)**. See **[MPEP § 821.04(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e108664.html)**. Applicant is advised that if any claim presented in a divisional application is anticipated by, or includes all the limitations of, a claim that is allowable in the present application, such claim may be subject to provisional statutory and/or nonstatutory double patenting rejections over the claims of the instant application.

### Examiner Note:

1. This form paragraph is to be used when claims are presented to both **combination(s)** and **subcombination(s)** (**[MPEP § 806.05(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e104168.html)**).

2. In bracket 3, specify the limitations of the claimed subcombination that are not required by the claimed combination, or the evidence that supports the conclusion that the combination does not rely upon the specific details of the subcombination for patentability. See **[MPEP § 806.05(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e104168.html)**, subsection II and **[§ 806.05(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e104544.html)**.

4. Conclude restriction requirement with form paragraph **[8.21](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//fp8.21.html)**.

# ¶ 8.16    Subcombinations, Usable Together

Inventions **[1]** and **[2]** are related as subcombinations disclosed as usable together in a single combination. The subcombinations are distinct if they do not overlap in scope and are not obvious variants, and if it is shown that at least one subcombination is separately usable. In the instant case subcombination **[3]** has separate utility such as **[4]**. See **[MPEP § 806.05(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e104544.html)**.

The examiner has required restriction between subcombinations usable together. Where applicant elects a subcombination and claims thereto are subsequently found allowable, any claim(s) depending from or otherwise requiring all the limitations of the allowable subcombination will be examined for patentability in accordance with **[37 CFR 1.104](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e322124.html)**. See **[MPEP § 821.04(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e108664.html)**. Applicant is advised that if any claim presented in a divisional application is anticipated by, or includes all the limitations of, a claim that is allowable in the present application, such claim may be subject to provisional statutory and/or nonstatutory double patenting rejections over the claims of the instant application.

### Examiner Note:

1. This form paragraph is to be used when claims are presented to subcombinations usable together (**[MPEP § 806.05(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e104544.html)**).

3. This form paragraph must be followed by form paragraph **[8.21](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//fp8.21.html)**.

# ¶ 8.20.03    Unrelated Product and Process Inventions

Inventions **[1]** and **[2]** are directed to an unrelated product and process. Product and process inventions are unrelated if it can be shown that the product cannot be used in, or made by, the process. See **[MPEP § 802.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e97928.html)** and **[§ 806.06](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e105649.html)**. In the instant case, **[3]** .

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 3, insert reasons for concluding that the inventions are unrelated.

2. This form paragraph must be followed by form paragraph **[8.21](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//fp8.21.html)**.

# ¶ 8.21    To Establish Burden AND Requirement for Election and Means for Traversal for all Restrictions, other than an Election of Species

Restriction for examination purposes as indicated is proper because all the inventions listed in this action are independent or distinct for the reasons given above and there would be a serious search and/or examination burden if restriction were not required because one or more of the following reasons apply:

**[1]**.

**Applicant is advised that the reply to this requirement to be complete must include (i) an election of an invention to be examined** even though the requirement may be traversed (**[37 CFR 1.143](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e324130.html)** ) **and (ii) identification of the claims encompassing the elected invention.**

The election of an invention may be made with or without traverse. To reserve a right to petition, the election must be made with traverse. If the reply does not distinctly and specifically point out supposed errors in the restriction requirement, the election shall be treated as an election without traverse. Traversal must be presented at the time of election in order to be considered timely. Failure to timely traverse the requirement will result in the loss of right to petition under **[37 CFR 1.144](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e324143.html)**. If claims are added after the election, applicant must indicate which of these claims are readable upon the elected invention.

Should applicant traverse on the ground that the inventions are not patentably distinct, applicant should submit evidence or identify such evidence now of record showing the inventions to be obvious variants or clearly admit on the record that this is the case. In either instance, if the examiner finds one of the inventions unpatentable over the prior art, the evidence or admission may be used in a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//al_d1fbe1_19797_b0.html)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e302450.html##d0e302455)**  of the other invention.

### Examiner Note:

1. THIS FORM PARAGRAPH MUST BE ADDED TO ALL RESTRICTION REQUIREMENTS **other than** those containing **only election of species**, with or without an action on the merits, or an those containing only an election by original presentation requirement. This form paragraph only needs to be used once, after all restriction requirements are set out.

2. In bracket 1 insert the applicable reason(s) why there is a serious search and/or examination burden.

-For a serious search burden list one or more of the following:

--the inventions have acquired a separate status in the art in view of their different classification;

--the inventions have acquired a separate status in the art due to their recognized divergent subject matter; and/or

--the inventions require a different field of search (e.g., searching different classes/subclasses or electronic resources, or employing different search strategies or search queries).

-For a serious examination burden explain the reason, such as non-prior art issues under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e302376.html)**, **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e302824.html)**, first paragraph, and/or **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**  are relevant to one invention that are not relevant to the other invention(s).

# ¶ 8.21.04    Notice of Potential Rejoinder of Process Claims

The examiner has required restriction between product and process claims. Where applicant elects claims directed to the product/apparatus, and all product/apparatus claims are subsequently found allowable, withdrawn process claims that include all the limitations of the allowable product/apparatus claims should be considered for rejoinder. All claims directed to a nonelected process invention must include all the limitations of an allowable product/apparatus claim for that process invention to be rejoined.

In the event of rejoinder, the requirement for restriction between the product/apparatus claims and the rejoined process claims will be withdrawn, and the rejoined process claims will be fully examined for patentability in accordance with **[37 CFR 1.104](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e322124.html)**. Thus, to be allowable, the rejoined claims must meet all criteria for patentability including the requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e302376.html)**, **[102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e302383.html)**, **[103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e302450.html)**  and **[112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e302824.html)**. Until all claims to the elected product/apparatus are found allowable, an otherwise proper restriction requirement between product/apparatus claims and process claims may be maintained. Withdrawn process claims that are not commensurate in scope with an allowable product/apparatus claim will not be rejoined. See **[MPEP § 821.04](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e108548.html)**. Additionally, in order for rejoinder to occur, applicant is advised that the process claims should be amended during prosecution to require the limitations of the product/apparatus claims. **Failure to do so may result in no rejoinder.** Further, note that the prohibition against double patenting rejections of **[35 U.S.C. 121](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e303040.html)**  does not apply where the restriction requirement is withdrawn by the examiner before the patent issues. See **[MPEP § 804.01.](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e101210.html)**

### Examiner Note:

This form paragraph should appear at the end of any requirement for restriction between a process and a product/apparatus for practicing the process (see form paragraph **[8.17](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//fp8.17.html)**), a product/apparatus and a process of making the product/apparatus (see form paragraph **[8.18](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//fp8.18.html)**) or between a product/apparatus and a process of using the product/apparatus (see form paragraph **[8.20](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//fp8.20.html)**). See **[MPEP § 821.04](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e108548.html)** for rejoinder practice.

# ¶ 8.23    Requirement, When Elected by Telephone

During a telephone conversation with **[1]** on **[2]** a provisional election was made **[3]** traverse to prosecute the invention of **[4]**, claim **[5]**. Affirmation of this election must be made by applicant in replying to this Office action. Claim **[6]** withdrawn from further consideration by the examiner, **[37 CFR 1.142(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e324111.html)**, as being drawn to a non-elected invention.

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 3, insert --with-- or --without--, whichever is applicable.

2. In bracket 4, insert either the elected group or species.

3. An action on the merits of the claims to the elected invention should follow.

# ¶ 8.23.01    Requirement, No Election by Telephone

A telephone call was made to **[1]** on **[2]** to request an oral election to the above restriction requirement, but did not result in an election being made.

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 1, insert the name of the applicant or attorney or agent contacted.

2. In bracket 2, insert the date(s) of the telephone contact(s).

3. This form paragraph should be used in all instances where a telephone election was attempted and the applicant’s representative did not or would not make an election.

4. This form paragraph should **not** be used if no contact was made with applicant or applicant’s representative.

# ¶ 8.23.02    Joint Inventors, Correction of Inventorship

Applicant is reminded that upon the cancelation of claims to a non-elected invention, the inventorship must be corrected in compliance with **[37 CFR 1.48(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e317930.html##d0e317941)**  if one or more of the currently named inventors is no longer an inventor of at least one claim remaining in the application. A request to correct inventorship under **[37 CFR 1.48(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e317930.html##d0e317941)**  must be accompanied by an application data sheet in accordance with **[37 CFR 1.76](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//aia_d0e320348.html)**  that identifies each inventor by his or her legal name and by the processing fee required under **[37 CFR 1.17(i)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//eff_20130320_d0e315199.html##eff_20130320_d0e315546)**.

### Examiner Note:

This form paragraph must be included in all restriction requirements for applications having joint inventors.

# ¶ 08.23.03    No Telephone Restriction Permitted, No Attorney or Agent of Record, Practitioner Included in ADS

Telephone restriction practice is not permitted because it appears applicant has legal representation but a valid power of attorney has not been filed in the present application. Providing representative information in an Application Data Sheet (ADS) does not constitute a power of attorney. See **[37 CFR 1.76(b)(4)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//plt_d0e320348.html##aia_d0e320410)**  and **[MPEP § 408](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e22768.html)**. For information on appointing a power of attorney, see **[MPEP § 402.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e21068.html)** _et seq_.

### Examiner Note:

This form paragraph should be used ONLY when a practitioner or customer number is identified in the ADS but no power of attorney is of record.

# ¶ 8.25    Answer to Arguments With Traverse

Applicant’s election with traverse of **[1]** in the reply filed on **[2]** is acknowledged. The traversal is on the ground(s) that **[3]**. This is not found persuasive because **[4]**.

The requirement is still deemed proper and is therefore made FINAL.

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 1, insert the invention elected.

2. In bracket 3, insert in summary form, the ground(s) on which traversal is based.

3. In bracket 4, insert the reasons why the traversal was not found to be persuasive.

# ¶ 8.25.01    Election Without Traverse

Applicant’s election without traverse of **[1]** in the reply filed on **[2]** is acknowledged.

# ¶ 8.25.02    Election Without Traverse Based on Incomplete Reply

Applicant’s election of **[1]** in the reply filed on **[2]** is acknowledged. Because applicant did not distinctly and specifically point out the supposed errors in the restriction requirement, the election has been treated as an election without traverse (**[MPEP § 818.01(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//ch800_d24ad1_2385f_cf.html)**).

# ¶ 8.26    Canceled Elected Claims, Non-Responsive

The amendment filed on **[1]** canceling all claims drawn to the elected invention and presenting only claims drawn to a non-elected invention is non-responsive (**[MPEP § 821.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e108405.html)**) and has not been entered. The remaining claims are not readable on the elected invention because **[2]**.

Since the above-mentioned amendment appears to be _a bona fide_ attempt to reply, applicant is given a shortened statutory period of **TWO (2) MONTHS** from the mailing date of this notice within which to supply the omission or correction in order to avoid abandonment. EXTENSIONS OF THIS TIME PERIOD UNDER **[37 CFR 1.136(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e323655.html)**  ARE AVAILABLE but in no case can any extension carry the date for reply to this letter beyond the maximum period of SIX MONTHS set by statute (**[35 U.S.C. 133](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e303207aia.html)** ).

### Examiner Note:

This form paragraph should not be used for an application filed on or after August 25, 2006 that has been granted special status under the accelerated examination program or other provisions under **[37 CFR 1.102(c)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e321932.html##d0e321956)**  or **[(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e321932.html##d0e321972)**. Form paragraph **[8.26.AE](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//fp8.26.AE.html)** should be used instead.

# ¶ 8.26.AE    Canceled Elected Claims, Non-Responsive – Application Under Accelerated Examination

The amendment filed on **[1]** canceling all claims drawn to the elected invention and presenting only claims drawn to a non-elected invention is non-responsive (**[MPEP § 821.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e108405.html)**) and has not been entered. The remaining claims are not readable on the elected invention because **[2]**.

Since the above-mentioned amendment appears to be a _bona fide_ attempt to reply, applicant is given a shortened statutory period of **TWO (2) MONTHS** from the mailing date of this notice within which to supply the omission or correction in order to avoid abandonment. This application has been granted special status under the accelerated examination program. Extensions of time under **[37 CFR 1.136(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e323655.html)**  are available. However, filing a petition for extension of time will result in the application being taken out of the accelerated examination program. In no case can any extension carry the date for reply to this letter beyond the maximum period of SIX MONTHS set by statute (**[35 U.S.C. 133](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e303207aia.html)** ).

The objective of the accelerated examination program is to complete the examination of an application within twelve months from the filing date of the application. To meet that objective, any reply must be filed electronically via the USPTO patent electronic filing system so that the papers will be expeditiously processed and considered. If the reply is not filed electronically via the USPTO patent electronic filing system, the final disposition of the application may occur later than twelve months from the filing of the application.

### Examiner Note:

1. This form paragraph should only be used in an application filed on or after August 25, 2006, that has been granted special status under the accelerated examination program or on other grounds under **[37 CFR 1.102(c)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e321932.html##d0e321956)**  or **[(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e321932.html##d0e321972)**.

This form paragraph should not be used for an application that has been granted special status under **[37 CFR 1.102(c)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e321932.html##d0e321952)**  on the basis of applicant’s health or age, or the Patent Prosecution Highway pilot program.

# ¶ 8.27.aia    Different Inventors, Common Assignee, Same Invention, Examined under First Inventor To File (FITF) Provisions of the AIA

Claim **[1]** directed to the same invention as that of claim **[2]** of commonly assigned **[3]**. Under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e302376.html)**, more than one patent may not be issued on the same invention.

The USPTO may not institute a derivation proceeding in the absence of a timely filed petition. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office normally will not institute a derivation proceeding between applications or a patent and an application having common ownership (see **[37 CFR 42.411](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//ar_d1fd69_18c8a_3bb.html)** ). The applicant should amend or cancel claims such that the reference and the instant application no longer contain claims directed to the same invention.

### Examiner Note:

1. Form paragraph **[7.03.aia](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//fp7.03.aia.html)** must be included in any Office action that contains this paragraph.

2. In bracket 3, insert the U.S. patent number or the copending application number.

3. The claims listed in brackets 1 and 2 must be for the same invention. If one invention would have been obvious in view of the other, do not use this form paragraph; see form paragraph **[8.28.aia](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//fp8.28.aia.html)**.

4. A provisional or actual statutory double patenting rejection should also be made using form paragraph **[8.31](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//fp8.31.html)** or **[8.32](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//fp8.32.html)**.

5. If the commonly assigned application or patent is prior art under **[35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//al_d1fbe1_234ed_52.html##al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**, a rejection may also be made using form paragraph **[7.15.01.aia](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//fp7.15.01.aia.html)** or **[7.15.02.aia](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//fp7.15.02.aia.html)**.

Claim **[1]** directed to the same invention as that of claim **[2]** of commonly assigned **[3]**. The issue of priority under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e302383.html)**  and possibly **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e302383.html)**  of this single invention must be resolved.

The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office normally will not institute an interference between applications or a patent and an application having common ownership (see **[MPEP Chapter 2300](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e237627.html)**). Either the applicant must amend or cancel claims such that the reference and the instant application no longer contain claims directed to the same invention, or the assignee must state which entity is the prior inventor of the commonly claimed subject matter. A terminal disclaimer has no effect in this situation since the basis for refusing more than one patent is priority of invention under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(f) or (g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e302383.html)**  and not an extension of monopoly.

Failure to comply with this requirement will result in a holding of abandonment of this application.

# ¶ 8.30    35 U.S.C. 101, Statutory Basis for Double Patenting "Heading" Only

A rejection based on double patenting of the "same invention" type finds its support in the language of **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e302376.html)**  which states that "whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process... may obtain a patent therefor..." (Emphasis added). Thus, the term "same invention," in this context, means an invention drawn to identical subject matter. See _Miller v. Eagle Mfg. Co_., 151 U.S. 186 (1894); _In re Vogel_, 422 F.2d 438, 164 USPQ 619 (CCPA 1970); _In re Ockert_, 245 F.2d 467, 114 USPQ 330 (CCPA 1957).

A statutory type (**[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e302376.html)** ) double patenting rejection can be overcome by canceling or amending the claims that are directed to the same invention so they are no longer coextensive in scope. The filing of a terminal disclaimer cannot overcome a double patenting rejection based upon **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e302376.html)**.

Claim **[1]** is/are rejected under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e302376.html)**   as claiming the same invention as that of claim **[2]** of prior U.S. Patent No. **[3]**. This is a statutory double patenting rejection.

### Examiner Note:

1. This form paragraph must be preceded by form paragraph **[8.30](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//fp8.30.html)** and is used only for double patenting rejections of the same invention claimed in an earlier patent; that is, the "scope" of the inventions claimed is identical.

2. If the claims directed to the same invention are in another copending application, do not use this form paragraph. A provisional double patenting rejection should be made using form paragraph **[8.32](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//fp8.32.html)**.

3. Do not use this form paragraph for nonstatutory-type double patenting rejections. If nonstatutory type, use appropriate form paragraphs **[8.33](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//fp8.33.html)** to **[8.39](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//fp8.39.html)**.

4. This form paragraph may be used where the patent and the application under examination:

a. name the same inventive entity, or

b. name different inventive entities but are commonly assigned, or

c. are not commonly assigned but name at least one common (joint) inventor, or

d. are filed by a common applicant (**[35 U.S.C. 118](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e302910912.html)** ), or

e. claim patentably indistinct inventions made as a result of activities undertaken within the scope of a joint research agreement under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e302450.html##d0e302521)**  for applications examined under pre-AIA (first to invent) law, or

f. claim patentably indistinct inventions and the claimed invention and the patent were commonly owned under **[35 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(C)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//al_d1fbe1_234ed_52.html##al_d1d85b_11e7d_1bf)**  or deemed to be commonly owned under **[35 U.S.C. 102(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//al_d1fbe1_234ed_52.html##al_d1d85b_11e8f_148)**  not later than the effective filing date under **[35 U.S.C. 100(i)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e302338313.html##al_d1d85b_11e1a_39f)**  of the claimed invention, for applications examined under the first inventor to file (FITF) provisions of the AIA.

5. In bracket 3, insert the number of the patent.

6. For applications being examined under pre-AIA (first to invent) law: If the patent is to a different inventive entity and is commonly assigned with the application, form paragraph **[8.27.fti](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//fp8.27.fti.html)** should additionally be used to require the assignee to name the first inventor.

7. If evidence is of record to indicate that the patent is prior art under either **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e302383.html##d0e302420)**  or **[(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e302383.html##d0e302424)**, a rejection should also be made using form paragraphs **[7.15.fti](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//fp7.15.fti.html)** and/or **[7.19.fti](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//fp7.19.fti.html)**, if applicable, in addition to this double patenting rejection.

8. For applications being examined under pre-AIA (first to invent) law: If the patent is prior art under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e302383.html##d0e302407)**  to the claimed invention, a rejection should additionally be made using form paragraph **[7.15.02.fti](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//fp7.15.02.fti.html)**.

9. For applications being examined under the first inventor to file (FITF) provisions of the AIA: If the patent is to a different inventive entity and is commonly assigned with the application, form paragraph **[8.27.aia](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//fp8.27.aia.html)** should additionally be used to request that the applicant take action to amend or cancel claims such that the application no longer contains claims directed to the same invention. A rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//al_d1fbe1_234ed_52.html##al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**  should also be made if appropriate.

# ¶ 8.32    Provisional Rejection, 35 U.S.C. 101, Double Patenting

Claim **[1]** provisionally rejected under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e302376.html)**  as claiming the same invention as that of claim **[2]** of copending Application No. **[3]** (reference application). This is a provisional statutory double patenting rejection since the claims directed to the same invention have not in fact been patented.

### Examiner Note:

1. This form paragraph must be preceded by form paragraph **[8.30](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//fp8.30.html)** and is used only for double patenting rejections of the same invention claimed in another copending application; that is, the scope of the claimed inventions is identical.

2. If the claims directed to the same invention are in an issued patent, do not use this paragraph. See form paragraph **[8.31](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//fp8.31.html)**.

3. Do not use this paragraph for nonstatutory-type double patenting rejections. See form paragraphs **[8.33](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//fp8.33.html)** to **[8.39](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//fp8.39.html)**.

4. This form paragraph may be used where the reference application and the application under examination:

a. name the same inventive entity, or

b. name different inventive entities but are commonly assigned, or

c. are not commonly assigned but name at least one common (joint) inventor (unless disclosure of the reference application would violate the duty of the USPTO to keep the reference application confidential under **[35 U.S.C. 122](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e303054.html)**  e.g., the applicant or assignee of record has specifically requested that the inventor not be permitted to access the record in the manner provided in **[MPEP § 106](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e2695.html)**), or

d. are filed by a common applicant (**[35 U.S.C. 118](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e302910912.html)** ), or

e. claim patentably indistinct inventions made as a result of activities undertaken within the scope of a joint research agreement under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e302450.html##d0e302521)**, for applications examined under pre-AIA (first to invent) law, or

f. claim patentably indistinct inventions and the claimed invention and the reference application were commonly owned under **[35 U.S.C. 102(b)(2)(C)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//al_d1fbe1_234ed_52.html##al_d1d85b_11e7d_1bf)**  or deemed to be commonly owned under **[35 U.S.C. 102(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//al_d1fbe1_234ed_52.html##al_d1d85b_11e8f_148)**  not later than the effective filing date under **[35 U.S.C. 100(i)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e302338313.html##al_d1d85b_11e1a_39f)**  of the claimed invention, for applications examined under the first inventor to file (FITF) provisions of the AIA.

5. Form paragraph **[8.28.fti](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//fp8.28.fti.html)** or **[8.28.aia](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//fp8.28.aia.html)**, as appropriate, should also be used.

6. In bracket 3, insert the number of the reference application.

7. A provisional double patenting rejection should also be made in the reference application.

8. For applications being examined under pre-AIA (first to invent) law: If the reference application is by a different inventive entity and is commonly assigned, form paragraph **[8.27.fti](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//fp8.27.fti.html)** should additionally be used to require the assignee to name the first inventor.

9. If evidence is also of record to show that either application is prior art unto the other under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e302383.html##d0e302420)**  or **[(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e302383.html##d0e302424)**, a rejection should also be made in the reference application using form paragraphs **[7.15.fti](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//fp7.15.fti.html)** and/or **[7.19.fti](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//fp7.19.fti.html)**, if applicable, in addition to this provisional double patenting rejection.

10. For applications being examined under pre-AIA (first to invent) law: If the reference application is prior art under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e302383.html##d0e302407)**  to the claimed invention, a provisional **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e302383.html##d0e302407)**  rejection should additionally be made using form paragraph **[7.15.01.fti](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//fp7.15.01.fti.html)**. If the reference application has been published, use form paragraph **[7.15.02.fti](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//fp7.15.02.fti.html)** instead.

11. For applications being examined under first inventor to file (FITF) provisions of the AIA: If the reference application is to a different inventive entity and is commonly assigned with the instant application, form paragraph **[8.27.aia](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//fp8.27.aia.html)** should additionally be used to request that the applicant take action to amend or cancel claims such that the applications no longer contain claims directed to the same invention. A rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 102(a)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//al_d1fbe1_234ed_52.html##al_d1d85b_11e72_315)**  should also be made if appropriate.

# ¶ 8.33    Basis for Nonstatutory Double Patenting, "Heading" Only

The nonstatutory double patenting rejection is based on a judicially created doctrine grounded in public policy (a policy reflected in the statute) so as to prevent the unjustified or improper timewise extension of the "right to exclude" granted by a patent and to prevent possible harassment by multiple assignees. A nonstatutory double patenting rejection is appropriate where the conflicting claims are not identical, but at least one examined application claim is not patentably distinct from the reference claim(s) because the examined application claim is either anticipated by, or would have been obvious over, the reference claim(s). _See, e.g., In re Berg, 140 F.3d 1428, 46 USPQ2d 1226 (Fed. Cir. 1998); In re Goodman_, 11 F.3d 1046, 29 USPQ2d 2010 (Fed. Cir. 1993); _In re Longi_, 759 F.2d 887, 225 USPQ 645 (Fed. Cir. 1985); _In re Van Ornum_, 686 F.2d 937, 214 USPQ 761 (CCPA 1982); _In re Vogel_, 422 F.2d 438, 164 USPQ 619 (CCPA 1970); _In re Thorington,_ 418 F.2d 528, 163 USPQ 644 (CCPA 1969).

A timely filed terminal disclaimer in compliance with **[37 CFR 1.321(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e326459.html)**  or **[1.321(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//aia_d0e326459.html##aia_d0e326548)**  may be used to overcome an actual or provisional rejection based on nonstatutory double patenting provided the reference application or patent either is shown to be commonly owned with the examined application, or claims an invention made as a result of activities undertaken within the scope of a joint research agreement. See **[MPEP § 717.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//ch700_d1ffd5_1b424_139.html)** for applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file provisions of the AIA as explained in **[MPEP § 2159](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd.html)**. See **[MPEP § 2146](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e213206.html)** et seq. for applications not subject to examination under the first inventor to file provisions of the AIA. A terminal disclaimer must be signed in compliance with **[37 CFR 1.321(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//aia_d0e326459.html##aia_d0e326493)**.

The filing of a terminal disclaimer by itself **is not a complete reply** to a nonstatutory double patenting (NSDP) rejection. A complete reply requires that the terminal disclaimer be accompanied by a reply requesting reconsideration of the prior Office action. Even where the NSDP rejection is provisional the reply must be complete. See **[MPEP § 804](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e98894.html)**, subsection I.B.1. For a reply to a non-final Office action, see **[37 CFR 1.111(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e322449.html##d0e322457)**. For a reply to final Office action, see **[37 CFR 1.113(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e322575.html##d0e322618)**. A request for reconsideration while not provided for in **[37 CFR 1.113(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e322575.html##d0e322618)**  may be filed after final for consideration. See **[MPEP §§ 706.07(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e69716.html)** and **[714.13](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e88092.html)**.

The USPTO Internet website contains terminal disclaimer forms which may be used. Please visit **[www.uspto.gov/ patent/patents-forms](http://www.uspto.gov/patent/patents-forms)**. The actual filing date of the application in which the form is filed determines what form (e.g., PTO/SB/25, PTO/SB/26, PTO/AIA/25, or PTO/AIA/26) should be used. A web-based eTerminal Disclaimer may be filled out completely online using web-screens. An eTerminal Disclaimer that meets all requirements is auto-processed and approved immediately upon submission.

# ¶ 8.40    Improper Markush Grouping Rejection

Claim **[1]** rejected on the basis that it contains an improper Markush grouping of alternatives. See _In re Harnisch,_ 631 F.2d 716, 721-22 (CCPA 1980) and _Ex parte Hozumi,_ 3 USPQ2d 1059, 1060 (Bd. Pat. App. & Int. 1984). A Markush grouping is proper if the alternatives defined by the Markush group (i.e., alternatives from which a selection is to be made in the context of a combination or process, or alternative chemical compounds as a whole) share a "single structural similarity" and a common use. A Markush grouping meets these requirements in two situations. First, a Markush grouping is proper if the alternatives are all members of the same recognized physical or chemical class or the same art-recognized class, and are disclosed in the specification or known in the art to be functionally equivalent and have a common use. Second, where a Markush grouping describes alternative chemical compounds, whether by words or chemical formulas, and the alternatives do not belong to a recognized class as set forth above, the members of the Markush grouping may be considered to share a "single structural similarity" and common use where the alternatives share both a substantial structural feature and a common use that flows from the substantial structural feature. See **[MPEP § 2117](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//ch2100_d299b6_1ae8e_380.html)**.

The Markush grouping of **[2]** is improper because the alternatives defined by the Markush grouping do not share both a single structural similarity and a common use for the following reasons: **[3]**.

To overcome this rejection, Applicant may set forth each alternative (or grouping of patentably indistinct alternatives) within an improper Markush grouping in a series of independent or dependent claims and/or present convincing arguments that the group members recited in the alternative within a single claim in fact share a single structural similarity as well as a common use.

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 1, insert claim number(s) and "is" or "are" as appropriate.

2. In bracket 2, insert a description of the Markush group(s) that are improper.

3. In bracket 3, explain why these alternatives do not meet the requirements for a proper Markush grouping, i.e., why the alternatives are not all members of the same recognized physical or chemical class or the same art-recognized class; and/or why the members are not considered to be functionally equivalent and have a common use; and/or why (if the Markush grouping describes alternative chemical compounds), the alternatives do not share both a substantial structural feature and a common use that flows from the substantial structural feature. See **[MPEP § 2117](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//ch2100_d299b6_1ae8e_380.html)**.

4. If an election of species requirement is appropriate, this form paragraph should only be used after applicant has made an election.

# ¶ 8.41    Transitional Restriction or Election of Species Requirement – pre-GATT Filing

This application is subject to the transitional restriction provisions of Public Law 103-465, which became effective on June 8, 1995, because:

- 1. the application was filed on or before June 8, 1995, and has an effective U.S. filing date of June 8, 1992, or earlier;
- 2. a requirement for restriction was not made in the present or a parent application prior to April 8, 1995; and
- 3. the examiner was not prevented from making a requirement for restriction in the present or a parent application prior to April 8, 1995, due to actions by the applicant.

The transitional restriction provisions permit applicant to have more than one independent and distinct invention examined in the same application by paying a fee for each invention in excess of one.

Final rules concerning the transition restriction provisions were published in the _Federal Register_ at 60 FR 20195 (April 25, 1995) and in the _Official Gazette_ at 1174 OG 15 (May 2, 1995).

# ¶ 8.50    Elected Invention Allowable, Some Claims No Longer Considered Withdrawn

Claim **[1]** allowable. The restriction requirement **[2]**, as set forth in the Office action mailed on **[3]**, has been reconsidered in view of the allowability of claims to the elected invention pursuant to **[MPEP § 821.04(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e108664.html)**. **The restriction requirement is hereby withdrawn as to any claim that requires all the limitations of an allowable claim.** Specifically, the restriction requirement of **[4]** is **[5]**. Claim **[6]**, directed to **[7]** no longer withdrawn from consideration because the claim(s) requires all the limitations of an allowable claim. However, claim **[8]**, directed to **[9]** withdrawn from consideration because **[10]** require all the limitations of an allowable claim.

In view of the above noted withdrawal of the restriction requirement, applicant is advised that if any claim presented in a divisional application is anticipated by, or includes all the limitations of, a claim that is allowable in the present application, such claim may be subject to provisional statutory and/or nonstatutory double patenting rejections over the claims of the instant application.

Once a restriction requirement is withdrawn, the provisions of **[35 U.S.C. 121](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e303040.html)**  are no longer applicable. See _In re Ziegler_, 443 F.2d 1211, 1215, 170 USPQ 129, 131-32 (CCPA 1971). See also **[MPEP § 804.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e101210.html)**.

### Examiner Note:

1. This form paragraph is applicable where a restriction requirement was made between related product inventions or between related process inventions. See **[MPEP §§ 806.05(j)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e105372.html)** and **[821.04(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//d0e108664.html)**.

2. This form paragraph should be used upon the allowance of a linking claim, generic claim, or subcombination claim when some, but not all, of the nonelected claims require all the limitations of an allowable claim and wherein the nonelected claims have NOT been canceled. Use form paragraph **[8.46](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//fp8.46.html)**, **[8.47](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//fp8.47.html)**, or **[8.47.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//fp8.47.01.html)** as appropriate where the nonelected claims HAVE BEEN canceled. Use form paragraph **[8.45](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//fp8.45.html)** when the elected invention is allowable and the restriction requirement is withdrawn in its entirety. Use form paragraph **[8.49](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//fp8.49.html)** when the elected invention is allowable and the restriction requirement is maintained without modification.

3. In bracket 2, insert -- between-- or --among-- followed by identification of the inventions (i.e., groups or species) restricted.

4. In bracket 4, insert the date of the restriction requirement being fully or partially withdrawn.

5. In bracket 5, insert "withdrawn" if the restriction requirement is no longer in effect at all or "partially withdrawn" if the restriction requirement is still partially in effect. If the restriction requirement is still partially in effect, state the claim(s) to which it still applies.

6. In bracket 7, insert the subject matter of the claimed invention or species being rejoined followed by either -- is-- or -- are--.

7. In bracket 9, insert the subject matter of the claimed invention or species not being rejoined followed by -- remains-- or --remain--.

8. In bracket 10, insert --it does not-- or --they do not all--.

9. If all of the claims are in proper form, i.e., they include all the limitations of an allowable claim, one of form paragraphs **[8.45](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//fp8.45.html)**, **[8.46](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//fp8.46.html)** or **[8.47](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=800.html#//fp8.47.html)** must be used.
