The summary is separate and distinct from the abstract and is directed toward the invention rather than the disclosure as a whole. The summary may point out the advantages of the invention or how it solves problems previously existent in the prior art (and preferably indicated in the Background of the Invention). In chemical cases it should point out in general terms the utility of the invention. If possible, the nature and gist of the invention or the inventive concept should be set forth. Objects of the invention should be treated briefly and only to the extent that they contribute to an understanding of the invention.

(i) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWING(S): See **[MPEP § 608.01(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e44626.html)**. A reference to and brief description of the drawing(s) as set forth in **[37 CFR 1.74](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e320259.html)**.

(j) DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION: See **[MPEP § 608.01(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e44731.html)**.

The description should be as short and specific as is necessary to describe the invention adequately and accurately. Where elements or groups of elements, compounds, and processes, which are conventional and generally widely known in the field of the invention described, and their exact nature or type is not necessary for an understanding and use of the invention by a person skilled in the art, they should not be described in detail. However, where particularly complicated subject matter is involved or where the elements, compounds, or processes may not be commonly or widely known in the field, the specification should refer to another patent or readily available publication which adequately describes the subject matter.

(k) CLAIM OR CLAIMS: See **[37 CFR 1.75](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e320269.html)**  and **[MPEP § 608.01(m)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e45061.html)**. The claim or claims must commence on a separate sheet or electronic page (**[37 CFR 1.52(b)(3)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e318327.html##d0e318439)** ). Where a claim sets forth a plurality of elements or steps, each element or step of the claim should be separated by a line indentation. There may be plural indentations to further segregate subcombinations or related steps. See **[37 CFR 1.75](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e320269.html)**  and **[MPEP 608.01(i)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e44872.html)**-**[(p)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e46258.html)**.

(l) ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE: See **[37 CFR 1.72](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e320224.html)** (b) and **[MPEP § 608.01(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e44136.html)**. The abstract is a brief narrative of the disclosure as a whole, as concise as the disclosure permits, in a single paragraph preferably not exceeding 150 words, commencing on a separate sheet following the claims. In an international application which has entered the national stage (**[37 CFR 1.491(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//aia_d0e329128.html##aia_d0e329149)** ), the applicant need not submit an abstract commencing on a separate sheet if an abstract was published with the international application under **[PCT Article 21](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e363622.html)**. The abstract that appears on the cover page of the pamphlet published by the International Bureau (IB) of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) is the abstract that will be used by the USPTO. See **[MPEP § 1893.03(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e192440.html)**.

(m) SEQUENCE LISTING: See **[37 CFR 1.821](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e333653.html)** -**[1.825](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e334511.html)**  and **[MPEP §§ 2421](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e242548.html)**-**[2431](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e247790.html)**. The requirement for a sequence listing applies to all sequences disclosed in a given application, whether the sequences are claimed or not. See **[MPEP § 2422.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e245121.html)**.

# ¶ 6.14    Abstract of the Disclosure: Content

Applicant is reminded of the proper content of an abstract of the disclosure.

A patent abstract is a concise statement of the technical disclosure of the patent and should include that which is new in the art to which the invention pertains. The abstract should not refer to purported merits or speculative applications of the invention and should not compare the invention with the prior art.

If the patent is of a basic nature, the entire technical disclosure may be new in the art, and the abstract should be directed to the entire disclosure. If the patent is in the nature of an improvement in an old apparatus, process, product, or composition, the abstract should include the technical disclosure of the improvement. The abstract should also mention by way of example any preferred modifications or alternatives.

Where applicable, the abstract should include the following: (1) if a machine or apparatus, its organization and operation; (2) if an article, its method of making; (3) if a chemical compound, its identity and use; (4) if a mixture, its ingredients; (5) if a process, the steps. Extensive mechanical and design details of an apparatus should not be included in the abstract. The abstract should be in narrative form and generally limited to a single paragraph within the range of 50 to 150 words in length.

See **[MPEP § 608.01(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e44136.html)** for guidelines for the preparation of patent abstracts.

### Examiner Note:

See form paragraph **[6.16](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//fp6.16.html)**

# ¶ 6.15    Abstract of the Disclosure: Chemical Cases

Applicant is reminded of the proper content of an abstract of the disclosure.

In chemical patent abstracts for compounds or compositions, the general nature of the compound or composition should be given as well as its use, _e.g._, "The compounds are of the class of alkyl benzene sulfonyl ureas, useful as oral anti-diabetics." Exemplification of a species could be illustrative of members of the class. For processes, the type of reaction, reagents and process conditions should be stated, generally illustrated by a single example unless variations are necessary.

### Examiner Note:

See also form paragraphs **[6.12](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//fp6.12.html)** – **[6.14](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//fp6.14.html)** and **[6.16](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//fp6.16.html)**.

# ¶ 6.16    Abstract of the Disclosure: Language

Applicant is reminded of the proper language and format for an abstract of the disclosure.

The abstract should be in narrative form and generally limited to a single paragraph on a separate sheet preferably within the range of 50 to 150 words in length. The abstract should describe the disclosure sufficiently to assist readers in deciding whether there is a need for consulting the full patent text for details.

The language should be clear and concise and should not repeat information given in the title. It should avoid using phrases which can be implied, such as, "The disclosure concerns," "The disclosure defined by this invention," "The disclosure describes," etc. In addition, the form and legal phraseology often used in patent claims, such as "means" and "said," should be avoided.

### Examiner Note:

See also form paragraph **[6.12](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//fp6.12.html)** - **[6.15](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//fp6.15.html)**.

# ¶ 6.16.01    Abstract of the Disclosure: Placement

The abstract of the disclosure does not commence on a separate sheet in accordance with **[37 CFR 1.52(b)(4)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e318327.html##d0e318446)**  and **[1.72(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e320224.html##d0e320239)**. A new abstract of the disclosure is required and must be presented on a separate sheet, apart from any other text.

### Examiner Note:

1. **[37 CFR 1.72(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e320224.html##d0e320239)**  requires that the abstract be set forth on a separate sheet. This requirement applies to amendments to the abstract as well as to the initial filing of the application.

2. This form paragraph should not be used during the national stage prosecution of international applications ("371 applications") if an abstract was published with the international application under **[PCT Article 21](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e363622.html)**.

# ¶ 6.17    Numbering of Claims, 37 CFR 1.126

The numbering of claims is not accordance with **[37 CFR 1.126](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e323308.html)**, which requires the original numbering of the claims to be preserved throughout the prosecution. When claims are canceled, the remaining claims must not be renumbered. When new claims are presented, they must be numbered consecutively beginning with the number next following the highest numbered claims previously presented (whether entered or not).

Misnumbered claim **[1]** been renumbered **[2]**.

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 1, insert appropriate claim number(s) and --has-- or -- have --.

2. In bracket 2, insert correct claim number(s) and --, respectively -- if more than one claim is involved.

# ¶ 6.18    Series of Singular Dependent Claims

A series of singular dependent claims is permissible in which a dependent claim refers to a preceding claim which, in turn, refers to another preceding claim.

A claim which depends from a dependent claim should not be separated by any claim which does not also depend from said dependent claim. It should be kept in mind that a dependent claim may refer to any preceding independent claim. In general, applicant’s sequence will not be changed. See **[MPEP § 608.01(n)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e45256.html)**.

2. In bracket 2, insert the reason why the amendment has not been entered. For example: (1) the present application was filed before September 21, 2004, the effective date of the provisions now in **[37 CFR 1.57(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e319490.html##d0e319498)**  (the provisions were formerly in 37 CFR 1.57(a)); (2) the claim for priority/benefit of the prior-filed application was not present on the filing date of the present application; (3) the inadvertently omitted portion is not completely contained in the prior-filed application; (4) a copy of the prior-filed application (except where the prior-filed application is an application filed under **[35 U.S.C. 111](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e302673.html)** ) was not submitted; (5) an English language translation of the prior-filed non-English language application was not submitted; or (6) applicant did not identify where the inadvertently omitted portion of the specification or drawings can be found in the prior-filed application.

3. This form paragraph must be followed by form paragraph **[7.28](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//fp7.28.html)**, where the amendment is made to the specification and/or drawings and introduces new matter into the disclosure, and/or form paragraph **[7.31.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//fp7.31.01.html)**, where the amendment adds new matter to the claims or affects the claims.

4. If the amendment is an after-final amendment, an advisory action should be issued indicating that the amendment raises new issues because it is not in compliance with **[37 CFR 1.57(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e319490.html##d0e319498)**.

5. This form paragraph should not be used if there is an express incorporation by reference since applicant would not need to comply with the requirements of **[37 CFR 1.57(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e319490.html##d0e319498)**.

# ¶ 6.19.03    Correction of Ineffective Incorporation by Reference

The incorporation by reference will not be effective until correction is made to comply with **[37 CFR 1.57(c), (d), or (e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e319490.html)**. If the incorporated material is relied upon to meet any outstanding objection, rejection, or other requirement imposed by the Office, the correction must be made within any time period set by the Office for responding to the objection, rejection, or other requirement for the incorporation to be effective. Compliance will not be held in abeyance with respect to responding to the objection, rejection, or other requirement for the incorporation to be effective. In no case may the correction be made later than the close of prosecution as defined in **[37 CFR 1.114(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e322625.html)**, or abandonment of the application, whichever occurs earlier.

Any correction inserting material by amendment that was previously incorporated by reference must be accompanied by a statement that the material being inserted is the material incorporated by reference and the amendment contains no new matter. **[37 CFR 1.57(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e319490.html)**.

# ¶ 6.20    Trade Names, Trademarks, and Other Marks Used in Commerce

The use of the term **[1]**, which is a trade name or a mark used in commerce, has been noted in this application. The term should be accompanied by the generic terminology; furthermore the term should be capitalized wherever it appears or, where appropriate, include a proper symbol indicating use in commerce such as ™, SM, or ® following the term.

Although the use of trade names and marks used in commerce (i.e., trade marks, service marks, certification marks, and collective marks) are permissible in patent applications, the proprietary nature of the marks should be respected and every effort made to prevent their use in any manner which might adversely affect their validity as commercial marks.

### Examiner Note:

1. Capitalize each letter of the term in the bracket or, where appropriate, include a proper symbol indicating use in commerce such as ™, SM, or ® following the term.

2. Examiners may conduct a search for registered marks by using Trademark Search which is available on the USPTO website to determine whether a mark identified in the patent application is a registered mark or not.

# ¶ 6.21    New Drawings, Competent Draftsperson

New corrected drawings in compliance with **[37 CFR 1.121(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e323020.html##d0e323179)**  are required in this application because **[1]**. Applicant is advised to employ the services of a competent patent draftsperson outside the Office, as the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office does not prepare new drawings. The corrected drawings are required in reply to the Office action to avoid abandonment of the application. The requirement for corrected drawings will not be held in abeyance.

# ¶ 6.22    Drawings Objected To

The drawings are objected to because **[1]**. Corrected drawing sheets in compliance with **[37 CFR 1.121(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e323020.html)**  are required in reply to the Office action to avoid abandonment of the application. Any amended replacement drawing sheet should include all of the figures appearing on the immediate prior version of the sheet, even if only one figure is being amended. The figure or figure number of an amended drawing should not be labeled as "amended." If a drawing figure is to be canceled, the appropriate figure must be removed from the replacement sheet, and where necessary, the remaining figures must be renumbered and appropriate changes made to the brief description of the several views of the drawings for consistency. Additional replacement sheets may be necessary to show the renumbering of the remaining figures. Each drawing sheet submitted after the filing date of an application must be labeled in the top margin as either "Replacement Sheet" or "New Sheet" pursuant to **[37 CFR 1.121(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e323020.html)**.

Color photographs will be accepted if the conditions for accepting color drawings and black and white photographs have been satisfied. See **[37 CFR 1.84(b)(2).](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e320999.html)** 

### Examiner Note:

1. This form paragraph should be used only if the application contains color photographs or color drawings as the drawings required by **[37 CFR 1.81.](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e320940.html)** 

2. This form paragraph should not be used in design applications.

# ¶ 6.26    Drawings Do Not Permit Examination

The drawings are not of sufficient quality to permit examination. Accordingly, replacement drawing sheets in compliance with **[37 CFR 1.121(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e323020.html)**  are required in reply to this Office action. The replacement sheet(s) should be labeled "Replacement Sheet" in the page header (as per **[37 CFR 1.84(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e320999.html)** ) so as not to obstruct any portion of the drawing figures. If the changes are not accepted by the examiner, the applicant will be notified and informed of any required corrective action in the next Office action.

Applicant is given a shortened statutory period of **TWO (2) MONTHS** to submit new drawings in compliance with **[37 CFR 1.81](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e320940.html)**. Extensions of time may be obtained under the provisions of **[37 CFR 1.136(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e323655.html)**  but in no case can any extension carry the date for reply to this letter beyond the maximum period of SIX MONTHS set by statute (**[35 U.S.C. 133](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e303207aia.html)** ). Failure to timely submit replacement drawing sheets will result in ABANDONMENT of the application.

### Examiner Note:

1. Use of this form paragraph should be extremely rare and limited to those instances where no examination can be performed due to the poor quality of the drawings resulting in a lack of understanding of the claimed subject matter.

2. Use a PTOL-90 or PTO-90C form as a cover sheet for this communication.

# ¶ 6.27    Requirement for Marked-up Copy of Drawing Corrections

In addition to Replacement Sheets containing the corrected drawing figure(s), applicant is required to submit a marked-up copy of each Replacement Sheet including annotations indicating the changes made to the previous version. The marked-up copy must be clearly labeled as "Annotated Sheet" and must be presented in the amendment or remarks section that explains the change(s) to the drawings. See **[37 CFR 1.121(d)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e323020.html)**. Failure to timely submit the corrected drawing and marked-up copy will result in the abandonment of the application.

### Examiner Note:

1. When this form paragraph is used by the examiner, the applicant must provide a marked-up copy of any amended drawing figure, including annotations indicating the changes made in the drawing replacement sheets. See **[37 CFR 1.121(d)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e323020.html)**.

A substitute specification filed after the mailing of a notice of allowance is governed by **[37 CFR 1.312](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e326304.html)**.

# ¶ 6.29    Specification, Spacing of Lines

The spacing of the lines of the specification is such as to make reading difficult. New application papers with lines 1 1/2 or double spaced (see **[37 CFR 1.52(b)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e318327.html##d0e318411)** ) on good quality paper are required.

# ¶ 6.30    Numerous Errors in Specification

**[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**  or **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e302824.html)**  (pre-AIA), first paragraph, requires the specification to be written in "full, clear, concise, and exact terms." The specification is replete with terms which are not clear, concise and exact. The specification should be revised carefully in order to comply with **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**  or **[35 U.S.C. 112 (pre-AIA)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e302824.html)**. Examples of some unclear, inexact or verbose terms used in the specification are: **[1]**.

# ¶ 6.31    Lengthy Specification

The lengthy specification has not been checked to the extent necessary to determine the presence of all possible minor errors. Applicant’s cooperation is requested in correcting any errors of which applicant may become aware in the specification.

# ¶ 6.32.01    Application Papers Must Be Legible

The specification (including the abstract and claims), and any amendments for applications, except as provided for in **[37 CFR 1.821](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e333653.html)**  through **[1.825](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e334511.html)**, must have text written plainly and legibly either by a typewriter or machine printer in a nonscript type font (_e.g.,_ Arial, Times Roman, or Courier, preferably a font size of 12) lettering style having capital letters which should be at least 0.3175 cm. (0.125 inch) high, but may be no smaller than 0.21 cm. (0.08 inch) high (_e.g._, a font size of 6) in portrait orientation and presented in a form having sufficient clarity and contrast between the paper and the writing thereon to permit the direct reproduction of readily legible copies in any number by use of photographic, electrostatic, photo-offset, and microfilming processes and electronic capture by use of digital imaging and optical character recognition; and only a single column of text. See **[37 CFR 1.52(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e318327.html)**  and (b).

The application papers are objected to because **[1]**.

A legible substitute specification in compliance with **[37 CFR 1.52(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e318327.html)**  and (b) and **[1.125](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e323278.html)**  is required.

Any amended replacement drawing sheet should include all of the figures appearing on the immediate prior version of the sheet, even if only one figure is being amended. The figure or figure number of an amended drawing should not be labeled as "amended." If a drawing figure is to be canceled, the appropriate figure must be removed from the replacement sheet, and where necessary, the remaining figures must be renumbered and appropriate changes made to the brief description of the several views of the drawings for consistency. Additional replacement sheets may be necessary to show the renumbering of the remaining figures. Each drawing sheet submitted after the filing date of an application must be labeled in the top margin as either "Replacement Sheet" or "New Sheet" pursuant to **[37 CFR 1.121(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e323020.html)**. If the changes are not accepted by the examiner, the applicant will be notified and informed of any required corrective action in the next Office action. The objection to the drawings will not be held in abeyance.

### Examiner Note:

In bracket 1, insert the features that must be shown.

# ¶ 6.36.01    Illustration of "Prior Art"

The replacement sheet(s) should be labeled "Replacement Sheet" in the page header (as per **[37 CFR 1.84(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e320999.html)** ) so as not to obstruct any portion of the drawing figures. If the changes are not accepted by the examiner, the applicant will be notified and informed of any required corrective action in the next Office action. The objection to the drawings will not be held in abeyance.

# ¶ 6.37    Acknowledgment of Replacement Drawing Sheets

The drawings were received on **[1]**. These drawings are **[2]**.

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 2, insert either --acceptable-- or --unacceptable--.

2. Identify any drawing(s) not entered because they contain new matter and explain the correction(s) necessary to obtain entry upon resubmission.

3. If unacceptable because of noncompliance with **[37 CFR 1.121(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=600.html#//d0e323020.html)**, an explanation must be provided. Form PTOL-324 may be used instead of this form paragraph to provide the explanation.
