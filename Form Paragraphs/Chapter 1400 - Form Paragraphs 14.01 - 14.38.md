For reissue applications filed on or after September 16, 2012, all references to **[35 U.S.C. 251](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e305345912.html)**  and **[37 CFR 1.172](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//aia_d0e324583.html)**, **[1.175](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//aia_d0e324769.html)**, and **[3.73](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//aia_d0e336732.html)**  are to the current provisions.

### Examiner Note:

This paragraph should be used as a heading in all Office actions in reissue applications.

# ¶ 14.01.01    Defective Reissue Oath/Declaration, 37 CFR 1.175 - No Statement of a Specific Error

The reissue oath/declaration filed with this application is defective because it fails to identify at least one error which is relied upon to support the reissue application. See **[37 CFR 1.175](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//aia_d0e324769.html)**  and **[MPEP § 1414](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e138489.html)**.

### Examiner Note:

1. Use this form paragraph when the reissue oath or declaration does not contain any statement of an error which is relied upon to support the reissue application.

2. This form paragraph can be used where the reissue oath or declaration does not even mention error. It can also be used where the reissue oath or declaration contains some discussion of the concept of error but never in fact identifies a specific error to be relied upon. For example, it is not sufficient for an oath or declaration to merely state "this application is being filed to correct errors in the patent which may be noted from the changes made in the disclosure."

3. Form paragraph **[14.14](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//fp14.14.html)** must follow this form paragraph.

### Examiner Note:

# ¶ 14.01.03    Defective Reissue Oath/Declaration, 37 CFR 1.175 - Multiple Identified "Errors" Not Appropriate Errors

The reissue oath/declaration filed with this application is defective because none of the errors which are relied upon to support the reissue application are errors upon which a reissue can be based. See **[37 CFR 1.175](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//aia_d0e324769.html)**  and **[MPEP § 1414](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e138489.html)**.

### Examiner Note:

1. Use this form paragraph when the reissue oath/declaration identifies more than one error relied upon to support the reissue application, and none of the errors are appropriate errors upon which a reissue can be based.

2. Note that if the reissue oath/declaration identifies more than one error relied upon, and at least one of the errors is an error upon which reissue can be based, this form paragraph should not be used, despite the additional reliance by applicant on "errors" which do not support the reissue. Only one appropriate error is needed to support a reissue.

3. Form paragraph **[14.14](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//fp14.14.html)** must follow this form paragraph.

# ¶ 14.01.04.fti    Defective Reissue Oath/Declaration in Application Filed Before Sept. 16, 2012, 37 CFR 1.175- Lack of Statement of "Without Any Deceptive Intention"

The reissue oath/declaration filed with this application, which has a filing date before September 16, 2012, is defective because it fails to contain a statement that all errors which are being corrected in the reissue application up to the time of filing of the oath/declaration arose without any deceptive intention on the part of the applicant. See **[pre-AIA 37 CFR 1.175](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e324769.html)**  and **[MPEP § 1414](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e138489.html)**.

### Examiner Note:

1. For reissue applications filed before September 16, 2012, use this form paragraph when the reissue oath/declaration does not contain the statement required by **[pre-AIA 37 CFR 1.175](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e324769.html)**  that all errors being corrected in the reissue application arose without any deceptive intention on the part of the applicant.

2. This form paragraph is appropriate to use for a failure by applicant to comply with the requirement, as to any of **[pre-AIA 37 CFR 1.175(a)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e324769.html)**, **[37 CFR 1.175(b)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e324769.html)**, or **[37 CFR 1.175(b)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e324769.html)**.

3. Form paragraph **[14.14](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//fp14.14.html)** must follow.

# ¶ 14.01.05    Defective Reissue Oath/Declaration, 37 CFR 1.175 - No Statement of Defect in the Patent

The reissue oath/declaration filed with this application is defective because it fails to contain the statement(s) required under **[37 CFR 1.175](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e324769.html)**  as to applicant’s belief that the original patent is wholly or partly inoperative or invalid. **[1]**

### Examiner Note:

1. Use this form paragraph when applicant: (a) fails to allege that the original patent is inoperative or invalid and/or (b) fails to state the reason of a defective specification or drawing, or of patentee claiming more or less than patentee had the right to claim in the patent. In bracket 1, point out the specific defect to applicant by using the language of (a) and/or (b), as it is appropriate.

2. Form paragraph **[14.14](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//fp14.14.html)** must follow this form paragraph.

# ¶ 14.01.06    Defective Reissue Oath/Declaration, 37 CFR 1.175 - General

The reissue oath/declaration filed with this application is defective (see **[37 CFR 1.175](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//aia_d0e324769.html)**  and **[MPEP § 1414](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e138489.html)**) because of the following:

### Examiner Note:

1. Use this form paragraph when the reissue oath/declaration does not comply with **[37 CFR 1.175](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//aia_d0e324769.html)**, and none of form paragraphs **[14.01.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//fp14.01.01.html)** - **[14.01.05](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//fp14.01.05.html)** or **[14.05.02.fti](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//fp14.05.02.fti.html)** apply.

2. This form paragraph must be followed by an explanation of why the reissue oath/declaration is defective.

3. Form paragraph **[14.14](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//fp14.14.html)** must follow the explanation of the defect.

# ¶ 14.05.02.fti    Supplemental Oath or Declaration Required Prior to Allowance - Application Filed Before Sept. 16, 2012

In accordance with **[pre-AIA 37 CFR 1.175(b)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e324769.html##d0e324793)**, for applications filed before September 16, 2012, a supplemental reissue oath/declaration must be received before this reissue application can be allowed.

Claim **[1]** rejected as being based upon a defective reissue **[2]** under **[35 U.S.C. 251](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e305345912.html)**. See **[37 CFR 1.175](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//aia_d0e324769.html)**. The nature of the defect is set forth above.

Receipt of an appropriate supplemental oath/declaration will overcome this rejection. An example of acceptable language to be used in the supplemental oath/declaration is as follows:

> "Every error in the patent which was corrected in the present reissue application, and is not covered by a prior oath/declaration submitted in this application, arose without any deceptive intention on the part of the applicant."

See **[MPEP § 1414.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//ch1400_d2001f_1ae15_336.html)**.

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 1, list all claims in the reissue application.

2. In bracket 2, insert either --oath-- or --declaration--.

3. This form paragraph is used in an Office action to: (a) remind applicant of the requirement for submission of the supplemental reissue oath/declaration under **[pre-AIA 37 CFR 1.175(b)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e324769.html##d0e324793)**  before allowance and (b) at the same time, reject all the claims since the reissue application is defective until the supplemental oath/declaration is submitted.

4. Do not use this form paragraph in a reissue application filed on or after September 16, 2012.

5. Do not use this form paragraph if no amendments (or other corrections of the patent) have been made subsequent to the last oath/declaration filed in the case; instead allow the case.

6. This form paragraph cannot be used in an _Ex parte Quayle_ action to require the supplemental oath/declaration, because the rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 251](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e305345912.html)**  is more than a matter of form.

7. Do not use this form paragraph in an examiner’s amendment. The supplemental oath/declaration must be filed prior to mailing of the Notice of Allowability.

# ¶ 14.06    Litigation-Related Reissue

The patent sought to be reissued by this application **[1]** involved in litigation. Any documents and/or materials which would be material to patentability of this reissue application are required to be made of record in response to this action.

### Examiner Note:

In bracket 1, insert either —is— or —has been—.

# ¶ 14.07    Action in Reissue Not Stayed or Suspended — Related Litigation Stayed

While there is a stay of the concurrent litigation related to this reissue application, action in this reissue application will NOT be stayed or suspended because a stay of that litigation is in effect for the purpose of awaiting the outcome of these reissue proceedings. Due to the related litigation status of this reissue application, EXTENSIONS OF TIME UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF **[37 CFR 1.136(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e323655.html)**  WILL NOT BE PERMITTED.

# ¶ 14.08    Action in Reissue Not Stayed — Related Litigation Terminated

Since the litigation related to this reissue application is terminated and final, action in this reissue application will NOT be stayed. Due to the related litigation status of this reissue application, EXTENSIONS OF TIME UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF **[37 CFR 1.136(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e323655.html)**  WILL NOT BE PERMITTED.

# ¶ 14.09    Action in Reissue Not Stayed — Related Litigation Not Overlapping

While there is concurrent litigation related to this reissue application, action in this reissue application will NOT be stayed because there are no significant overlapping issues between the application and that litigation. Due to the related litigation status of this reissue application, EXTENSIONS OF TIME UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF **[37 CFR 1.136(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e323655.html)**  WILL NOT BE PERMITTED.

# ¶ 14.10    Action in Reissue Not Stayed — Applicant’s Request

# ¶ 14.11    Action in Reissue Stayed - Related Litigation

In view of concurrent litigation, and in order to avoid duplication of effort between the two proceedings, action in this reissue application is STAYED until such time as it is evident to the examiner that (1) a stay of the litigation is in effect, (2) the litigation has been terminated, (3) there are no significant overlapping issues between the application and the litigation, or (4) applicant requests that the application be examined.

# ¶ 14.11.01    Reminder of Duties Imposed by 37 CFR 1.178(b) and 37 CFR 1.56

Applicant is reminded of the continuing obligation under **[37 CFR 1.178(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e324878.html##d0e324890)**, to timely apprise the Office of any prior or concurrent proceeding in which Patent No. **[1]** is or was involved. These proceedings would include any trial before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, interferences, reissues, reexaminations, supplemental examinations, and litigation.

Applicant is further reminded of the continuing obligation under **[37 CFR 1.56](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e319407.html)**, to timely apprise the Office of any information which is material to patentability of the claims under consideration in this reissue application.

These obligations rest with each individual associated with the filing and prosecution of this application for reissue. See also **[MPEP §§ 1404](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e135116.html)**, **[1442.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e140720.html)** and **[1442.04](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e141089.html)**.

### Examiner Note:

1. This form paragraph is to be used in the first action in a reissue application.

2. In bracket 1, insert the patent number of the original patent for which reissue is requested.

# ¶ 14.12    Rejection, 35 U.S.C. 251, Broadened Claims After Two Years

Claim **[1]** rejected under **[35 U.S.C. 251](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e305345.html)**  as being broadened in a reissue application filed outside the two year statutory period. **[2]** A claim is broader in scope than the original claims if it contains within its scope any conceivable product or process which would not have infringed the original patent. A claim is broadened if it is broader in any one respect even though it may be narrower in other respects.

### Examiner Note:

The claim limitations that broaden the scope should be identified and explained in bracket 2. See **[MPEP § 1412.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e137803.html)**.

# ¶ 14.13    Rejection, 35 U.S.C. 251, Broadened Claims Filed by Assignee

Claim **[1]** rejected under **[35 U.S.C. 251](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e305345.html)**  as being improperly broadened in a reissue application made and sworn to by the assignee. The application for reissue may be made and sworn to by the assignee of the entire interest only if the application does not seek to enlarge the scope of the claims of the original patent or, for reissue applications filed on or after September 16, 2012, the application for the original patent was filed by the assignee of the entire interest under **[37 CFR 1.46](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//aia_d0e317867.html)**.

**[2]** A claim is broader in scope than the original claims if it contains within its scope any conceivable product or process which would not have infringed the original patent. A claim is broadened if it is broader in any one respect even though it may be narrower in other respects.

### Examiner Note:

The claim limitations that broaden the scope should be identified and explained in bracket 2. See **[MPEP § 1412.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e137803.html)**.

# ¶ 14.14    Rejection, Defective Reissue Oath or Declaration

Claim **[1]** rejected as being based upon a defective reissue **[2]** under **[35 U.S.C. 251](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e305345.html)**  as set forth above. See **[37 CFR 1.175](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e324769.html)**.

The nature of the defect(s) in the **[3]** is set forth in the discussion above in this Office action.

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 1, list all claims in the reissue application. See **[MPEP § 1444](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e141320.html)**, subsection II.

2. This paragraph must be preceded by form paragraph **[14.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//fp14.01.html)** and should be preceded by form paragraphs **[14.01.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//fp14.01.01.html)** to **[14.01.06](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//fp14.01.06.html)** as appropriate

3. In brackets 2 and 3, insert either --oath-- or --declaration--.

# ¶ 14.15    Consent of Assignee to Reissue Lacking

This application is objected to under **[37 CFR 1.172(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e324583.html)**  as lacking the written consent of all assignees owning an undivided interest in the patent. The consent of the assignee must be in compliance with **[37 CFR 1.172](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e324583.html)**. See **[MPEP § 1410.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e135563.html)**.

A proper assent of the assignee in compliance with **[37 CFR 1.172](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e324583.html)**  and **[3.73](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e336732.html)**  is required in reply to this Office action.

### Examiner Note:

1. This form paragraph may be used in an Office action which rejects any of the claims on other grounds.

2. If a consent document/statement has been submitted but is insufficient (e.g., not by all the assignees) or is otherwise ineffective (e.g., a conditional consent, or a copy of the consent from the parent reissue application was filed in this continuation reissue application and the parent reissue application is not being abandoned), an explanation of such is to be included following this form paragraph.

3. If the case is otherwise ready for allowance, this form paragraph should be followed by form paragraph **[7.51](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//fp7.51.html)** (insert the phrase --See above-- in bracket 1 of form paragraph **[7.51](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//fp7.51.html)**).

# ¶ 14.16    Failure of Assignee To Establish Ownership

This application is objected to under **[37 CFR 1.172(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e324583.html)**  as the assignee has not established its ownership interest in the patent for which reissue is being requested. An assignee must establish its ownership interest _in order to support the consent to a reissue application required by **[37 CFR 1.172(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e324583.html)**_  . The assignee’s ownership interest is established by:

(a) filing in the reissue application evidence of a chain of title from the original owner to the assignee, or

(b) specifying in the record of the reissue application where such evidence is recorded in the Office (e.g., reel and frame number, etc.).

The submission with respect to (a) and (b) to establish ownership must be signed by a party authorized to act on behalf of the assignee. See **[MPEP § 1410.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e135563.html)**.

An appropriate paper satisfying the requirements of **[37 CFR 3.73](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e336732.html)**  must be submitted in reply to this Office action.

### Examiner Note:

1. This form paragraph may be used in an Office action which rejects any of the claims on other grounds.

2. If otherwise ready for allowance, this form paragraph should be followed by form paragraph **[7.51](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//fp7.51.html)** (insert the phrase --See above-- in bracket 1 of form paragraph **[7.51](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//fp7.51.html)**).

# ¶ 14.16.01    Establishment of Ownership Not Signed by Appropriate Party

This application is objected to under **[37 CFR 1.172(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e324583.html)**  as the assignee has not established its ownership interest in the patent for which reissue is being requested. An assignee must establish its ownership interest _in order to support the consent to a reissue application required by_ **[37 CFR 1.172(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//aia_d0e324583.html##aia_d0e324591)**. The submission establishing the ownership interest of the assignee is informal. There is no indication of record that the party who signed the submission is an appropriate party to sign on behalf of the assignee. See **[37 CFR 3.73](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//aia_d0e336732.html)**.

A proper submission establishing ownership interest in the patent, pursuant to **[37 CFR 1.172(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e324583.html)**, is required in response to this action.

### Examiner Note:

1. This form paragraph should be followed: by one of form paragraphs **[14.16.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//fp14.16.02.html)** through **[14.16.04.fti](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//fp14.16.04.fti.html)**, and then optionally by form paragraph **[14.16.06](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//fp14.16.06.html)**.

2. See **[MPEP § 1410.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//ch1400_d2001e_20efc_24f.html)**.

# ¶ 14.16.02    Failure To State Capacity To Sign

The person who signed the submission establishing ownership interest has failed to state in what capacity the submission on behalf of the corporation or other business entity was signed, and the person who signed it has not been established as being authorized to act on behalf of the assignee. For reissue applications filed on or after September 16, 2012, the submission establishing ownership may be signed by a patent practitioner of record. See **[37 CFR 3.73](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//aia_d0e336732.html)**; **[MPEP § 325](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//ch300_d1fdcf_1b3c0_2e5.html)**.

### Examiner Note:

1. This form paragraph is to be used when the person signing the submission establishing ownership interest does not state the person's capacity (e.g., as a recognized officer) to sign for the assignee, and is not established as being authorized to act on behalf of the assignee. For reissue applications filed on or after September 16, 2012, the submission establishing ownership may be signed by a patent practitioner of record (i.e., who has been given power in a power of attorney document in the file).

2. Use form paragraph **[14.16.06](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//fp14.16.06.html)** to explain how an official, other than a recognized officer, may properly sign a submission establishing ownership interest.

# ¶ 14.16.03    Lack of Capacity To Sign

The person who signed the submission establishing ownership interest is not recognized as an officer of the assignee, and the person who signed it has not been established as being authorized to act on behalf of the assignee. See **[MPEP § 324](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e19816.html)** (for applications filed before September 16, 2012) and **[§ 325](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//ch300_d1fdcf_1b3c0_2e5.html)** (for applications filed on or after September 16, 2012).

# ¶ 14.16.04.fti    Attorney/Agent of Record Signs - Application Filed Before Sept. 16, 2012

The submission establishing ownership interest was signed by applicant’s **[1]**. For reissue applications filed before September 16, 2012, an attorney or agent of record is not authorized to sign a submission establishing ownership interest, unless the attorney or agent has been established as being authorized to act on behalf of the assignee. See **[MPEP § 324](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e19816.html)**.

### Examiner Note:

1. This form paragraph is to be used in reissue applications filed before September 16, 2012, when the person signing the submission establishing ownership interest is an attorney or agent of record who is not an authorized officer as defined in **[MPEP § 324](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e19816.html)** and has not been established as being authorized to act on behalf of the assignee. For reissue applications filed on or after September 16, 2012, the submission may be signed by a patent practitioner of record. See **[37 CFR 3.73(d)(3)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//aia_d0e336732.html##ar_d1d8b6_1b8b9_2e)**.

2. Use form paragraph **[14.16.06](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//fp14.16.06.html)** to explain how an official, other than a recognized officer, may properly sign a submission establishing ownership interest.

3. In bracket 1, insert either --attorney-- or --agent--.

# ¶ 14.16.06    Criteria To Accept When Signed by a Non-Recognized Officer

It would be acceptable for a person, other than a recognized officer, to sign a submission establishing ownership interest, provided the record for the application includes a duly signed statement that the person is empowered to sign a submission establishing ownership interest and/or act on behalf of the assignee.

Accordingly, a new submission establishing ownership interest which includes such a statement above, will be considered to be signed by an appropriate official of the assignee. A separately filed paper referencing the previously filed submission establishing ownership interest and containing a proper empowerment statement would also be acceptable.

### Examiner Note:

1. This form paragraph MUST be preceded by form paragraphs **[14.16.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//fp14.16.02.html)**, **[14.16.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//fp14.16.03.html)** or **[14.16.04.fti](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//fp14.16.04.fti.html)**.

2. When one of form paragraphs **[14.16.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//fp14.16.02.html)**, **[14.16.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//fp14.16.03.html)** or **[14.16.04.fti](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//fp14.16.04.fti.html)** is used to indicate that a submission establishing ownership interest is not proper because it was not signed by a recognized officer, this form paragraph should be used to point out one way to correct the problem.

3. While an indication of the person’s title is desirable, its inclusion is not mandatory when this option is employed.

# ¶ 14.17    Rejection, 35 U.S.C. 251, Recapture

Claim**[1]** rejected under **[35 U.S.C. 251](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e305345.html)**  as being an impermissible recapture of broadened claimed subject matter surrendered in the application for the patent upon which the present reissue is based. _In re McDonald,_ 43 F.4th 1340, 1345, 2022 USPQ2d 745 (Fed. Cir. 2022); _Greenliant Systems, Inc. et al v. Xicor LLC_, 692 F.3d 1261, 103 USPQ2d 1951 (Fed. Cir. 2012); _In re Youman,_ 679 F.3d 1335, 102 USPQ2d 1862 (Fed. Cir. 2012); _In re Shahram Mostafazadeh and Joseph O. Smith_, 643 F.3d 1353, 98 USPQ2d 1639 (Fed. Cir. 2011); _North American Container, Inc. v. Plastipak Packaging, Inc._, 415 F.3d 1335, 75 USPQ2d 1545 (Fed. Cir. 2005); _Pannu v. Storz Instruments Inc._, 258 F.3d 1366, 59 USPQ2d 1597 (Fed. Cir. 2001); _Hester Industries, Inc. v. Stein, Inc._, 142 F.3d 1472, 46 USPQ2d 1641 (Fed. Cir. 1998); _In re Clement,_ 131 F.3d 1464, 45 USPQ2d 1161 (Fed. Cir. 1997); _Ball Corp. v. United States_, 729 F.2d 1429, 1436, 221 USPQ 289, 295 (Fed. Cir. 1984). The reissue application contains claim(s) that are broader than the issued patent claims. The record of the application for the patent family shows that the broadening aspect (in the reissue) relates to claimed subject matter that applicant previously surrendered during the prosecution of the application. Accordingly, the narrow scope of the claims in the patent was not an error within the meaning of **[35 U.S.C. 251](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e305345.html)**, and the broader scope of claim subject matter surrendered in the application for the patent cannot be recaptured by the filing of the present reissue application.

**[2]**

### Examiner Note:

In bracket 2, the examiner should explain the specifics of why recapture exists, including an identification of the omitted/broadened claim limitations in the reissue which provide the "broadening aspect" to the claim(s), where in the original application the narrowed claim scope was presented/argued to obviate a rejection/objection, and that the reissue claim is not materially narrowed so as to avoid recapture (i.e., explain the _prima facie_ analysis done for steps 1-3). See **[MPEP § 1412.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e136811.html)**.

An attorney or agent of record is authorized to sign the terminal disclaimer, even though there is no indication that the attorney or agent is an officer of the assignee.

3. Use form paragraph **[14.29.02.fti](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//fp14.29.02.fti.html)** to explain how an official, other than a recognized officer, may properly sign a terminal disclaimer.

# ¶ 14.29.02.fti    Criteria To Accept Terminal Disclaimer When Signed by a Non-Recognized Officer – Application Filed Before September 16, 2012

This application was filed before September 16, 2012. It would be acceptable for a person, other than a recognized officer, to sign a terminal disclaimer, provided the record for the application includes a statement that the person is empowered to sign terminal disclaimers and/or act on behalf of the assignee.

Accordingly, a new terminal disclaimer which includes the above empowerment statement will be considered to be signed by an appropriate official of the assignee. A separately filed paper referencing the previously filed terminal disclaimer and containing a proper empowerment statement would also be acceptable, if filed with another copy of the previously filed terminal disclaimer.

### Examiner Note:

1. This form paragraph MUST be preceded by form paragraph **[14.24](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//fp14.24.html)** or **[14.25](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//fp14.25.html)** AND form paragraph **[14.29.fti](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//fp14.29.fti.html)**.

The previously submitted disclaimer fee as set forth in **[37 CFR 1.20(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e316217.html)**  can be applied when submitting a replacement or supplemental terminal disclaimer. If, however, the disclaimer fee set forth in **[37 CFR 1.20(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e316217.html)**  has been increased since the fee was previously paid, then patent owner must pay the difference between the increased fee and the amount previously paid.

### Examiner Note:

This form paragraph can be used to notify a patent owner that the previously submitted disclaimer fee can be applied when a replacement or supplemental terminal disclaimer is submitted.

# ¶ 14.36    Suggestion That "Applicant" Request a Refund

The fee for the terminal disclaimer that was previously submitted has been applied to the filing of the replacement or supplemental terminal disclaimer. If the disclaimer fee set forth in **[37 CFR 1.20(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e316217.html##d0e316324)**  has been increased since the fee was previously paid, then applicant must pay the difference between the increased fee and the amount previously paid. Therefore, applicant's payment of another terminal disclaimer fee under **[37 CFR 1.20(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e316217.html##d0e316324)**  is not required or is not required for the full amount. Applicant may request a refund of any payment more than the terminal disclaimer fee required when the replacement or supplemental terminal disclaimer was filed by submitting a written request for a refund and a copy of this Office action to: Mail Stop 16, Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, P.O. Box 1450, Alexandria, Virginia 22313-1450.

### Examiner Note:

1. This form paragraph should be used to notify applicant that a refund can be obtained if another terminal disclaimer fee was paid when a replacement or supplemental terminal disclaimer was submitted and the previously paid disclaimer fee was applied.

2. Note - If applicant has authorized or requested a fee refund to be credited to a specific Deposit Account or credit card, then an appropriate credit should be made to that Deposit Account or credit card and this paragraph should NOT be used.

3. Use form paragraph **[14.36.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//fp14.36.01.html)** for providing notification to patent owner, rather than an applicant.

# ¶ 14.36.01    Suggestion That "Patent Owner" Request a Refund

The fee for the terminal disclaimer that was previously submitted has been applied to the filing of the replacement or supplemental terminal disclaimer. If the disclaimer fee set forth in **[37 CFR 1.20(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e316217.html##d0e316324)**  has been increased since the fee was previously paid, then patent owner must pay the difference between the increased fee and the amount previously paid. Therefore, patent owner's payment of another terminal disclaimer fee under **[37 CFR 1.20(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e316217.html##d0e316324)**  is not required or is not required for the full amount. Patent owner may request a refund of any payment more than the terminal disclaimer fee required when the replacement or supplemental terminal disclaimer was filed by submitting a written request for a refund and a copy of this Office action to: Mail Stop 16, Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office, P.O. Box 1450, Alexandria, Virginia 22313-1450.

2. Note - If patent owner has authorized or requested a fee refund to be credited to a specific Deposit Account or credit card, then an appropriate credit should be made to that Deposit Account or credit card and this form paragraph should NOT be used.

# ¶ 14.37    Information about a Terminal Disclaimer Over a Pending Application

A terminal disclaimer may be effective to overcome a provisional nonstatutory double patenting rejection over a pending application (**[37 CFR 1.321(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//d0e326459.html)**  and **[(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1400.html#//aia_d0e326459.html##aia_d0e326532)** ).
