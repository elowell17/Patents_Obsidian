# ¶ 7.01    Use of Unconventional Terminology, Cannot Be Examined

A preliminary examination of this application reveals that it includes terminology which is so different from that which is generally accepted in the art to which this invention pertains that a proper search of the prior art cannot be made. For example: **[1]**

Applicant is required to provide a clarification of these matters or correlation with art-accepted terminology so that a proper comparison with the prior art can be made. Applicant should be careful not to introduce any new matter into the disclosure (i.e., matter which is not supported by the disclosure as originally filed).

A shortened statutory period for reply to this action is set to expire TWO MONTHS from the mailing date of this letter.

### Examiner Note:

1. Use this or form paragraph **[7.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.02.html)** when a proper search cannot be made. However, see **[MPEP § 702.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e55492.html)** which requires a reasonable search.

2. In bracket 1, fill in an appropriate indication of the terminology, properties, units of data, etc. that are the problem as well as the pages of the specification involved.

3. For the procedure to be followed when the drawing is not acceptable, see **[MPEP §§ 608.02(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e48672.html)** and **[608.02(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e48751.html)**.

# ¶ 7.02    Disclosure Is Incomprehensible

The disclosure is objected to under **[37 CFR 1.71](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e320131.html)**, as being so incomprehensible as to preclude a reasonable search of the prior art by the examiner. For example, the following items are not understood: **[1]**

Applicant is required to submit an amendment which clarifies the disclosure so that the examiner may make a proper comparison of the invention with the prior art.

Applicant should be careful not to introduce any new matter into the disclosure (_i.e.,_ matter which is not supported by the disclosure as originally filed).

# ¶ 7.05.01    Rejection, 35 U.S.C. 101, Nonstatutory (Not One of the Four Statutory Categories)

the claimed invention is directed to nonstatutory subject matter. The claim(s) does/do not fall within at least one of the four categories of patent eligible subject matter because **[1]**

### Examiner Note:

1. This form paragraph should be preceded by form paragraph **[7.05](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.05.html)**.

2. In bracket 1, explain why the claimed invention is not patent eligible subject matter by identifying what the claim(s) is/are directed to and explain why it does not fall within at least one of the four categories of patent eligible subject matter recited in **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302376.html)**  (process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter), e.g., the claim(s) is/are directed to a signal _per se,_ mere information in the form of data, a contract between two parties, or a human being. Note, it is not necessary for a claim to fall into only a single category, so long as it is clear that it falls into at least one category (see **[MPEP § 2106.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e197244.html)**).

3. For a claim that is directed to a judicial exception and is nonstatutory, use form paragraph **[7.05.016](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.05.016.html)**.

# ¶ 7.05.016    Rejection, 35 U.S.C. 101, Nonstatutory (Directed to a Judicial Exception without an Inventive Concept/Significantly More)

the claimed invention is directed to **[1]** without significantly more. The claim(s) recite(s) **[2]**. This judicial exception is not integrated into a practical application because **[3]**. The claim(s) does/do not include additional elements that are sufficient to amount to significantly more than the judicial exception because **[4]**.

### Examiner Note:

1. This form paragraph should be preceded by form paragraph **[7.05](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.05.html)**. For claims that recite a tentative abstract idea (i.e., a limitation identified as an abstract idea even though it does not fall within the groupings of abstract ideas discussed in **[MPEP § 2106.04(a)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13ae3_321.html)**), this form paragraph should be accompanied by form paragraph **[7.05.017](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.05.017.html)**.

2. This form paragraph is for use with all product (machine, manufacture, and composition of matter) and process claims, and for all claims directed to a law of nature, natural phenomenon (including a product of nature), or abstract idea.

3. In bracket 1, identify whether the claim(s) are directed to a law of nature, a natural phenomenon (including a product of nature), or an abstract idea.

4. In bracket 2, identify the exception by referring to how it is recited in the claim and explain why it is considered an exception (e.g., for an abstract idea, identify the abstract idea grouping in **[MPEP § 2106.04(a)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13ae3_321.html)** into which the recited exception falls). For example, "the Arrhenius equation, which is a law of nature and a mathematical concept which describes the relationship between temperature and reaction rate" or "the series of steps instructing how to hedge risk, which is a fundamental economic practice and thus grouped as a certain method of organizing human interactions." For a product of nature exception, refer to how it is recited in the claim and explain why its characteristics are not markedly different from the product’s naturally occurring counterpart in its natural state. For example, "the naturally occurring DNA segment, which is not markedly different from its naturally occurring counterpart because it conveys the same genetic information." Provide additional explanation regarding the exception and how it has been identified when appropriate.

5. In bracket 3, explain why the combination of additional elements fails to integrate the judicial exception into a practical application. For example, if the claim is directed to an abstract idea with additional generic computer elements, explain that the generically recited computer elements do not add a meaningful limitation to the abstract idea because they amount to simply implementing the abstract idea on a computer; or, if the claim is directed to a method of using a naturally occurring correlation, explain that data gathering steps required to use the correlation do not add a meaningful limitation to the method as they are insignificant extra-solution activity. Similarly, if the claim recites a "naturally occurring DNA segment" with an additional element of a test tube, explain that merely placing the product of nature into a generic container such as a test tube does not add a meaningful limitation as it is merely a nominal or token extra-solution component of the claim, and is nothing more than an attempt to generally link the product of nature to a particular technological environment.

6. In bracket 4, identify the additional elements and explain why, when considered separately and in combination, they do not add significantly more (also known as an "inventive concept") to the exception. For example, if the additional limitations only store and retrieve information in memory, explain that these are well-understood, routine, conventional computer functions as recognized by the court decisions listed in **[MPEP § 2106.05(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13d41_124.html)**.

# ¶ 7.05.017    Rejection, 35 U.S.C. 101, TC Director Approval for "Tentative Abstract Idea"

The identified claim limitation(s) that recite(s) an abstract idea do/does not fall within the groupings of abstract ideas discussed in **[MPEP § 2106.04(a)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13ae3_321.html)**, i.e., mathematical concepts, mental processes, or certain methods of organizing human activity. Nonetheless, the claim limitation(s) is/are being treated as reciting an abstract idea because **[1]**.

This rejection has been approved by the Technology Center Director signing below.

**[2]**

### Examiner Note:

1. This form paragraph should be preceded by form paragraph **[7.05.016](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.05.016.html)**.

2. Approval from the TC Director is required to treat a tentative abstract idea (i.e., a claim limitation(s) that does not fall within the groupings of abstract ideas discussed in **[MPEP § 2106.04(a)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13ae3_321.html)**) as an abstract idea. This form paragraph should be used to demonstrate that this approval has been obtained.

3. In bracket 1, provide the justification for why the claim limitation(s) is/are being treated as an abstract idea. For example, provide an explanation of why the claim limitation is among the "basic tools of scientific and technological work."

4. In bracket 2, insert the TC Director's signature. Approval of the TC Director is required to treat a claim limitation that does not fall within the groupings of abstract ideas discussed in **[MPEP § 2106.04(a)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13ae3_321.html)** as reciting an abstract idea. See **[MPEP § 2106.04(a)(3)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//ch2100_d2ea80_199c8_1c1.html)**.

# ¶ 7.05.02    Rejection, 35 U.S.C. 101, Utility Lacking

the claimed invention lacks patentable utility. **[1]**

### Examiner Note:

In bracket 1, provide explanation of lack of utility. See **[MPEP §§ 2105](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e197008.html)** - **[2107.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e200058.html)**.

# ¶ 7.05.03    Rejection, 35 U.S.C. 101, Inoperative

the disclosed invention is inoperative and therefore lacks utility. **[1]**

### Examiner Note:

In bracket 1, explain why invention is inoperative.

# ¶ 7.05.04    Utility Rejections Under 35 U.S.C. 101 and 35 U.S.C. 112(a) or 35 U.S.C. 112 (pre-AIA), First Paragraph

Claim **[1]** rejected under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302376.html)**  because the claimed invention is not supported by either a **[2]** asserted utility or a well established utility.

**[3]**

Claim **[4]** also rejected under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**, first paragraph. Specifically, because the claimed invention is not supported by either a **[5]** asserted utility or a well established utility for the reasons set forth above, one skilled in the art clearly would not know how to use the claimed invention.

### Examiner Note:

1. Where the specification would not enable one skilled in the art to make the claimed invention, or where alternative reasons support the enablement rejection, a separate rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**, first paragraph, enablement should be made using the factors set forth in _In re Wands_, 858 F.2d 731, 8 USPQ2d 1400 (Fed. Cir. 1988) and an undue experimentation analysis. See **[MPEP §§ 2164](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e215224.html)** - **[2164.08(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e216899.html)**.

2. Use Format A, B, or C below as appropriate.

Format A:- (a) Insert the same claim numbers in brackets 1 and 4.
- (b) Insert --specific and substantial-- in inserts 2 and 5.
- (c) In bracket 3, insert the explanation as to why the claimed invention is not supported by either a specific and substantial asserted utility or a well established utility.
- (d) Format A is to be used when there is no asserted utility and when there is an asserted utility but that utility is not specific and substantial.

Format B:- (a) Insert the same claim numbers in brackets 1 and 4.
- (b) Insert --credible-- in inserts 2 and 5.
- (c) In bracket 3, insert the explanation as to why the claimed invention is not supported by either a credible asserted utility or a well established utility.

Format C:- For claims that have multiple utilities, some of which are not specific and substantial, some of which are not credible, but none of which are specific, substantial and credible:
    - (a) Insert the same claim numbers in brackets 1 and 4.
    - (b) Insert --specific and substantial asserted utility, a credible-- in inserts 2 and 5.
    - (c) In bracket 3, insert the explanation as to why the claimed invention is not supported by either a specific and substantial asserted utility, a credible asserted utility or a well established utility. Each utility should be addressed.

# ¶ 7.05.05    Duplicate Claims, Warning

Applicant is advised that should claim **[1]** be found allowable, claim **[2]** will be objected to under **[37 CFR 1.75](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e320269.html)**  as being a substantial duplicate thereof. When two claims in an application are duplicates or else are so close in content that they both cover the same thing, despite a slight difference in wording, it is proper after allowing one claim to object to the other as being a substantial duplicate of the allowed claim. See **[MPEP § 608.01(m)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e45061.html)**.

### Examiner Note:

1. Use this form paragraph whenever two claims are found to be substantial duplicates, but they are not allowable. This will give the applicant an opportunity to correct the problem and avoid a later objection.

2. If the claims are allowable, use form paragraph **[7.05.06](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.05.06.html)**.

3. When a dependent claim does not specify a further limitation of the subject matter claimed as required by **[35 U.S.C. 112(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae73_319)**, the dependent claim should be rejected using form paragraphs **[7.36](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.36.html)** and **[7.36.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.36.01.html)**.

# ¶ 7.05.06    Duplicate Claims, Objection

Claim **[1]** objected under **[37 CFR 1.75](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e320269.html)**  as being a substantial duplicate of claim **[2]**. When two claims in an application are duplicates or else are so close in content that they both cover the same thing, despite a slight difference in wording, it is proper after allowing one claim to object to the other as being a substantial duplicate of the allowed claim. See **[MPEP § 608.01(m)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e45061.html)**.

### Examiner Note:

1. If the duplicate claims are not allowable, use form paragraph **[7.05.05](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.05.05.html)**.

2. When a dependent claim does not specify a further limitation of the subject matter claimed as required by **[35 U.S.C. 112(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae73_319)**, the dependent claim should be rejected using form paragraphs **[7.36](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.36.html)** and **[7.36.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.36.01.html)**. See **[MPEP § 608.01(n)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e45256.html)**, subsection III. It is not necessary to also object to the improper dependent claim using this form paragraph.

# ¶ 7.06    Notice re prior art available under both pre-AIA and AIA

In the event the determination of the status of the application as subject to AIA **[35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//al_d1fbe1_234ed_52.html)**  and **[103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//al_d1fbe1_19797_b0.html)**  (or as subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302383.html)**  and **[103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302450.html)** ) is incorrect, any correction of the statutory basis (i.e., changing from AIA to pre-AIA) for the rejection will not be considered a new ground of rejection if the prior art relied upon, and the rationale supporting the rejection, would be the same under either status.

### Examiner Note:

1.  This form paragraph must be used in all Office Actions when a prior art rejection is made in an application with an actual filing date on or after March 16, 2013, that claims priority to, or the benefit of, an application filed before March 16, 2013.

2.  This form paragraph should only be used ONCE in an Office action.  

# ¶ 7.06.01    Claim Limitation Relating to a Tax Strategy Deemed To Be Within the Prior Art under 35 U.S.C. 102 and/or 103

Claim limitation "**[1]**" has been interpreted as a strategy for reducing, avoiding, or deferring tax liability ("tax strategy") pursuant to Section 14 of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act. Accordingly, this claim limitation is being treated as being within the prior art and is insufficient to differentiate the invention of claim **[2]** from the prior art.

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 1, recite the claim limitation that relates to a tax strategy. For more information see **[MPEP § 2124.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//ch2100_d1b13f_20224_b9.html)**.

If any one of the conditions is not met, the international filing date is not a U.S. filing date for prior art purposes under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302383.html##d0e302407)**.

4. If an international application (PCT) was published by WIPO in a language other than English, or did not designate the U.S., the international application’s publication by WIPO, the U.S. publication of the national stage application (**[35 U.S.C. 371](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e307164.html)** ) of the international application and a U.S. patent issued from the national stage of the international application may not be applied as a reference under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302383.html##d0e302407)**.

6. If the reference is a U.S. patent issued directly, or indirectly, from an international application (PCT) that has an international filing date prior to November 29, 2000, use form paragraph **[7.12.01.fti](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.12.01.fti.html)**. In that situation, **[pre-AIPA 35 U.S.C. 102(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//ch700_d222ef_29c79_2c1.html)** is applicable in the determination of the prior art date of the patent issued from such an international application.

# ¶ 7.12.01.fti    Pre-AIPA 35 U.S.C. 102(e), Patent to Another with Earlier Filing Date, Reference is a U.S. Patent Issued Directly or Indirectly From a National Stage of, or a Continuing Application Claiming Benefit to, an International Application Having an International Filing Date Prior to November 29, 2000

(e) the invention was described in a patent granted on an application for patent by another filed in the United States before the invention thereof by the applicant for patent, or on an international application by another who has fulfilled the requirements of paragraphs (1), (2), and (4) of section **[371(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e307164.html##d0e307183)**  of this title before the invention thereof by the applicant for patent.

The changes made to 35 U.S.C. 102(e) by the American Inventors Protection Act of 1999 (AIPA) and the Intellectual Property and High Technology Technical Amendments Act of 2002 do not apply when the reference is a U.S. patent resulting directly or indirectly from an international application filed before November 29, 2000. Therefore, the prior art date of the reference is determined under 35 U.S.C. 102(e) prior to the amendment by the AIPA (**pre-AIPA** 35 U.S.C. 102(e)).

### Examiner Note:

1. This form paragraph should only be used if the reference is a U.S. patent issued directly or indirectly from either a national stage of an international application (application under **[35 U.S.C. 371](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e307164.html)** ) which has an international filing date prior to November 29, 2000, or a continuing application claiming benefit to an international application having an international filing date prior to November 29, 2000.

2. If the reference is a U.S. patent issued directly from a national stage of such an international application, the reference’s **pre-AIPA** 35 U.S.C. 102(e) date is the date that the requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 371(c)(1), (2) and (4)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e307164.html##d0e307187)**  were fulfilled. The language of WIPO publication (PCT) is not relevant in this situation. Caution: the international publication of the international application (PCT) by WIPO may have an earlier prior art date under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//al_d1fbe1_234ed_52.html##al_d1d85b_11e72_2ee)**  or **[pre-AIA 102(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302383.html##d0e302395)**.

3. If the reference is a U.S. patent issued directly from a continuing application claiming benefit under **[35 U.S.C. 120](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e303023313.html)**, **[121](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e303040912.html)**  or **[365(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e307034.html##d0e307053)**  to such an international application (which had not entered the national stage prior to the continuing application’s filing date, otherwise see note 4), the prior art reference’s **pre-AIPA** 35 U.S.C. 102(e) date is the actual U.S. filing date of the continuing application. Caution: the international publication of the international application (PCT) by WIPO may have an earlier prior art date under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302383.html##d0e302391)**  or **[pre-AIA 102(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302383.html##d0e302395)**.

4. In determining the **pre-AIPA** 35 U.S.C. 102(e) date, consider benefit claims to earlier-filed U.S. provisional applications under **[35 U.S.C. 119(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302921.html##d0e302951)**, and to earlier-filed U.S. nonprovisional applications and international applications under **[35 U.S.C. 120](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e303023313.html)**, **[121](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e303040912.html)**, **[365(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e307034.html##d0e307053)**, or **[386(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//al_d225a2_27b56_2ab.html##al_d225a2_29a9c_1b3)**  only if the subject matter used to make the rejection is appropriately supported in the relied upon earlier-filed application’s disclosure (and any intermediate application(s)). A benefit claim to a U.S. patent of an earlier-filed international application may only result in an effective U.S. filing date as of the date the requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 371(c)(1), (2) and (4)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e307164.html##d0e307187)**  were fulfilled. Do NOT consider any benefit claims to U.S. applications which are filed before an international application. Do NOT consider foreign priority claims under **[35 U.S.C. 119(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302921.html##d0e302926)** -**[(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302921.html##d0e302947)**, **[365(a) or (b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e307034.html##d0e307039)**, or **[386(a) or (b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//al_d225a2_27b56_2ab.html)**.

In addition, a reference (i.e., a U.S. patent, published U.S. patent application, or WIPO publication) is entitled to the benefit of the filing date of a provisional application only if at least one of the claims in the reference is supported by the written description of the provisional application in compliance with **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**, first paragraph or **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**.

### Examiner Note:

1. This form paragraph should only be used in an application filed on or after March 16, 2013, where the claims are being examined under **[35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//al_d1fbe1_234ed_52.html)** /**[103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//al_d1fbe1_19797_b0.html)**  as amended by the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act. This form paragraph must be preceded by form paragraph **[7.03.aia](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.03.aia.html)**.

2. This form paragraph is NOT intended to be commonly used as a substitute for a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//al_d1fbe1_234ed_52.html)**. In other words, a single rejection under either **[35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//al_d1fbe1_234ed_52.html)**  or **[35 U.S.C. 103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//al_d1fbe1_19797_b0.html)**  should be made whenever possible. Examples of circumstances where this paragraph may be used are as follows:

a. When the interpretation of the claim(s) is or may be in dispute, i.e., given one interpretation, a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//al_d1fbe1_234ed_52.html)**  is appropriate and given another interpretation, a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//al_d1fbe1_19797_b0.html)**  is appropriate. See **[MPEP §§ 2111](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e200352.html)** - **[2116.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e201660.html)** for guidelines on claim interpretation.

b. When the reference discloses all the limitations of a claim except a property or function, and the examiner cannot determine whether or not the reference inherently possesses properties which anticipate or render obvious the claimed invention but has basis for shifting the burden of proof to applicant as in _In re Fitzgerald_, 619 F.2d 67, 205 USPQ 594 (CCPA 1980). See **[MPEP §§ 2112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e201036.html)** - **[2112.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e201360.html)**.

c. When the reference teaches a small genus which places a claimed species in the possession of the public as in _In re Schaumann_, 572 F.2d 312, 197 USPQ 5 (CCPA 1978), and the species would have been obvious even if the genus were not sufficiently small to justify a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//al_d1fbe1_234ed_52.html)**.

d. When the reference teaches a product that appears to be the same as, or an obvious variant of, the product set forth in a product-by-process claim although produced by a different process. See _In re Marosi_, 710 F.2d 799, 218 USPQ 289 (Fed. Cir. 1983) and _In re Thorpe_, 777 F.2d 695, 227 USPQ 964 (Fed. Cir. 1985). See also **[MPEP § 2113](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e201450.html)**.

e. When the reference teaches all claim limitations except a means plus function limitation and the examiner is not certain whether the element disclosed in the reference is an equivalent of the claimed element and therefore anticipatory, or whether the prior art element is an obvious variant of the claimed element. See **[MPEP §§ 2183](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e220121.html)** - **[2184](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e220302.html)**.

f. When the ranges disclosed in the reference and claimed by applicant overlap in scope but the reference does not contain a specific example within the claimed range. See the concurring opinion in _Ex parte Lee_, 31 USPQ2d 1105 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1993). See **[MPEP § 2131.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e203269.html)**.

3. If the interpretation of the claim(s) renders the claim(s) indefinite, a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)**  may be appropriate.

4. In bracket 1, insert the claim number(s) which is/are under rejection.

5. In bracket 2, insert the appropriate paragraph letter(s) in parenthesis.

6. In bracket 3, insert the prior art reference relied upon for the rejection.

7. A full explanation must follow this form paragraph, i.e., the examiner must provide an explanation of how the claims at issue could be considered to be anticipated, as well as how they could be considered to be obvious.

8. This form paragraph must be preceded by **[7.07.aia](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.07.aia.html)** and **[7.08.aia](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.08.aia.html)** and/or **[7.12.aia](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.12.aia.html)** or by form paragraph **[7.103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.103.html)**.

Applicant is required to cancel the new matter in the reply to this Office action.

### Examiner Note:

1. This form paragraph is not to be used in reissue applications; use form paragraph **[14.22.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp14.22.01.html)** instead.

2. In bracket 2, identify the new matter by page and the line numbers and provide an appropriate explanation of your position. This explanation should address any statement by applicant to support the position that the subject matter is described in the specification as filed. It should further include any unresolved questions which raise a doubt as to the possession of the claimed invention at the time of filing.

3. If new matter is added to the claims, or affects the claims, a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**, first paragraph, using form paragraph **[7.31.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.31.01.html)** should also be made. If new matter is added only to a claim, an objection using this paragraph should not be made, but the claim should be rejected using form paragraph **[7.31.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.31.01.html)**. As to any other appropriate prior art or **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**  rejection, the new matter must be considered as part of the claimed subject matter and cannot be ignored.

# ¶ 7.29    Disclosure Objected to, Minor Informalities

The disclosure is objected to because of the following informalities: **[1]**. Appropriate correction is required.

### Examiner Note:

Use this paragraph to point out minor informalities such as spelling errors, inconsistent terminology (see the requirement of **[37 CFR 1.71(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e320131.html##d0e320139)**  for "full, clear, concise, and exact terms"), numbering of elements (see **[37 CFR 1.74](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e320259.html)** ), etc., which should be corrected. See form paragraphs **[6.28](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp6.28.html)** to **[6.31](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp6.31.html)** for specific informalities.

# ¶ 7.29.01    Claims Objected to, Minor Informalities

Claim**[1]** objected to because of the following informalities: **[2]**. Appropriate correction is required.

### Examiner Note:

1. Use this form paragraph to point out minor informalities such as spelling errors, inconsistent terminology (see the requirement of **[37 CFR 1.71(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e320131.html##d0e320139)**  for "full, clear, concise, and exact terms"), etc., which should be corrected.

2. If the informalities render the claim(s) indefinite, use form paragraph **[7.34.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.34.01.html)** instead to reject the claim(s) under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)**  or **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**  (pre-AIA), second paragraph.

# ¶ 7.29.02    Claims Objected to, Reference Characters Not Enclosed Within Parentheses

The claims are objected to because they include reference characters which are not enclosed within parentheses.

Reference characters corresponding to elements recited in the detailed description of the drawings and used in conjunction with the recitation of the same element or group of elements in the claims should be enclosed within parentheses so as to avoid confusion with other numbers or characters which may appear in the claims. See **[MPEP § 608.01(m)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e45061.html)**.

### Examiner Note:

1. If the lack of parentheses renders the claim(s) indefinite, use form paragraph 7.34.01 instead to reject the claim(s) under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)**  or pre-AIA **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)** , second paragraph.

# ¶ 7.29.03    Claims Objected to, Spacing of Lines

The claims are objected to because the lines are crowded too closely together, making reading difficult. Substitute claims with lines one and one-half or double spaced on good quality paper are required. See **[37 CFR 1.52(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e318327.html)**.

# ¶ 7.29.04    Disclosure Objected To, Embedded Hyperlinks or Other Forms of Browser-Executable Code

The disclosure is objected to because it contains an embedded hyperlink and/or other form of browser-executable code. Applicant is required to delete the embedded hyperlink and/or other form of browser-executable code; references to websites should be limited to the top-level domain name without any prefix such as http:// or other browser-executable code. See **[MPEP § 608.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e42440.html)**.

### Examiner Note:

1. Examples of a hyperlink or a browser-executable code are a URL placed between these symbols "< >" and "http://" followed by a URL address. Nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence data placed between the symbols "< >" are not considered to be hyperlinks and/or browser-executable code.

2. If the application attempts to incorporate essential or nonessential subject matter into the patent application by reference to the contents of the site to which a hyperlink and/or other form of browser-executable code is directed, use form paragraph **[6.19](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp6.19.html)** or **[6.19.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp6.19.01.html)** instead. See also **[MPEP § 608.01(p)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e46258.html)**.

3. The requirement to delete an embedded hyperlink or other form of browser-executable code does not apply to electronic documents listed on forms PTO-892 and PTO/SB/08 where the electronic document is identified by reference to a URL.

4. Examiners should not object to hyperlinks where the hyperlinks and/or browser-executable codes themselves (rather than the contents of the site to which the hyperlinks are directed) are necessary to be included in the patent application in order to meet the requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**, first paragraph, and applicant does not intend to have those hyperlinks be active links.

_CLAIM INTERPRETATION_

### Examiner Note:

1. This form paragraph may be used in a first Office action or when a claim interpretation issue first arises, and need only be used once in an application, when appropriate.

2. This form paragraph may be used to preface any clarifying remarks regarding claim interpretation that the examiner chooses to add to enhance the prosecution record.

# ¶ 7.30.05    Broadest Reasonable Interpretation under 35 U.S.C. 112(f) or pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112, Sixth Paragraph: Use of "Means" (or "Step") in Claim Drafting and Rebuttable Presumptions Raised

The claims in this application are given their broadest reasonable interpretation using the plain meaning of the claim language in light of the specification as it would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art. The broadest reasonable interpretation of a claim element (also commonly referred to as a claim limitation) is limited by the description in the specification when **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**, sixth paragraph, is invoked.

As explained in **[MPEP § 2181](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e219279.html)**, subsection I, claim limitations that meet the following three-prong test will be interpreted under **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**, sixth paragraph:

- (A) the claim limitation uses the term "means" or "step" or a term used as a substitute for "means" that is a generic placeholder (also called a nonce term or a non-structural term having no specific structural meaning) for performing the claimed function;
- (B) the term "means" or "step" or the generic placeholder is modified by functional language, typically, but not always linked by the transition word "for" (e.g., "means for") or another linking word or phrase, such as "configured to" or "so that"; and
- (C) the term "means" or "step" or the generic placeholder is not modified by sufficient structure, material, or acts for performing the claimed function.

Use of the word "means" (or "step") in a claim with functional language creates a rebuttable presumption that the claim limitation is to be treated in accordance with **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**, sixth paragraph. The presumption that the claim limitation is interpreted under **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**, sixth paragraph, is rebutted when the claim limitation recites function without reciting sufficient structure, material or acts to entirely perform the recited function.

Absence of the word "means" (or "step") in a claim creates a rebuttable presumption that the claim limitation is not to be treated in accordance with **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**, sixth paragraph. The presumption that the claim limitation is not interpreted under **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**, sixth paragraph, is rebutted when the claim limitation recites function without reciting sufficient structure, material or acts to entirely perform the recited function.

Claim limitations in this application that use the word "means" (or "step") are being interpreted under **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**, sixth paragraph, except as otherwise indicated in an Office action. Conversely, claim limitations in this application that do not use the word "means" (or "step") are not being interpreted under **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**, sixth paragraph, except as otherwise indicated in an Office action.

### Examiner Note:

1. Use this paragraph ONLY ONCE in a given Office action the first time that a claim limitation uses "means" (or "step") or otherwise invokes treatment under **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**, sixth paragraph, by using a substitute term for "means" that serves as a generic placeholder.

2. This paragraph must be preceded with form paragraph **[7.30.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.30.03.html)** unless already cited in a previous Office action.

3. When a claim limitation is being interpreted under **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**, sixth paragraph (i.e., it meets the three-prong test), to provide clarification the examiner may identify the structure, material, or act disclosed in the specification that supports the recited function by adding explanatory remarks after this paragraph.

4. When the presumptions raised are rebutted by the claim language, for example by not using "means" and failing to recite structure that performs the function, or by using "means" along with definite structure that performs the function, use form paragraph **[7.30.06](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.30.06.html)** and/or **[7.30.07](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.30.07.html)**.

(a) Follow this form paragraph with form paragraph **[7.30.06](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.30.06.html)** when, despite the absence of the word "means," a claim limitation is interpreted under **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**, sixth paragraph.

(b) Follow this form paragraph with form paragraph **[7.30.07](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.30.07.html)** when, despite the presence of the word "means," a claim limitation is **not** being interpreted under **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**, sixth paragraph.

5. A claim limitation interpreted under **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**, sixth paragraph, that raises issues under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**  and/or **[112(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**, first and/or second paragraphs, respectively, should also be addressed, as appropriate.

This application includes one or more claim limitations that do not use the word "means," but are nonetheless being interpreted under **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**, sixth paragraph, because the claim limitation(s) uses a generic placeholder that is coupled with functional language without reciting sufficient structure to perform the recited function and the generic placeholder is not preceded by a structural modifier. Such claim limitation(s) is/are: **[1]** in claim **[2]**.

Because this/these claim limitation(s) is/are being interpreted under **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**, sixth paragraph, it/they is/are being interpreted to cover the corresponding structure described in the specification as performing the claimed function, and equivalents thereof.

If applicant does not intend to have this/these limitation(s) interpreted under **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**, sixth paragraph, applicant may: (1) amend the claim limitation(s) to avoid it/them being interpreted under **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**, sixth paragraph (e.g., by reciting sufficient structure to perform the claimed function); or (2) present a sufficient showing that the claim limitation(s) recite(s) sufficient structure to perform the claimed function so as to avoid it/them being interpreted under **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**, sixth paragraph.

Evidence of concealment of the best mode is based upon **[2]**.

### Examiner Note:

1. This rejection must be preceded by form paragraph **[7.30.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.30.01.html)** or **[7.103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.103.html)**.

2. In bracket 2, insert the basis for holding that the best mode has been concealed, e.g., the quality of applicant’s disclosure is so poor as to effectively result in concealment.

3. Use of this form paragraph should be rare. See **[MPEP §§ 2165](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e216924.html)**- **[2165.04](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e217264.html)**.

# ¶ 7.31.05    Rejection, 35 U.S.C. 112(a) or pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112, First Paragraph: Scope of Enablement of a "Single Means" Claim

Claim **[1]** rejected under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**, first paragraph, because the claim purports to invoke **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**, sixth paragraph, but fails to recite a combination of elements as required by that statutory provision and thus cannot rely on the specification to provide the structure, material or acts to support the claimed function. As such, the claim recites a function that has no limits and covers every conceivable means for achieving the stated function, while the specification discloses at most only those means known to the inventor. Accordingly, the disclosure is not commensurate with the scope of the claim.

### Examiner Note:

1. This rejection must be preceded by form paragraph **[7.30.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.30.01.html)** or **[7.103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.103.html)**.

2. In bracket 1, pluralize "Claim" if necessary, insert claim number(s), and insert --is-- or --are-- as appropriate.

3. This form paragraph is to be used only when the claim recites a single element and that element is in means-plus-function format. This situation should be rare.

2. In bracket 1, pluralize "Claim" if necessary, insert claim number(s), and insert --is-- or --are-- as appropriate. Any claim dependent on a listed rejected claim should be reviewed to determine if the dependent claim should be rejected as indefinite for the same reason(s) as the listed rejected claim(s), and if so, the dependent claim(s) should be added to the listed rejected claim(s).

3. This form paragraph should be followed by one or more of the following form paragraphs **[7.34.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.34.02.html)** - **[7.34.10](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.34.10.html)**, and/or **[7.34.23](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.34.23.html)** - **[7.34.24](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.34.24.html)** as applicable.

Whenever possible, identify the particular term(s) or limitation(s) which render the claim(s) indefinite and state why such term or limitation renders the claim indefinite. If the scope of the claimed subject matter can be determined by one having ordinary skill in the art, a rejection using this form paragraph would not be appropriate. See **[MPEP §§ 2171](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e217389.html)** - **[2174](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e219224.html)** for guidance. See also form paragraph **[7.34.15](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.34.15.html)** for _pro se_ applicants.

# ¶ 7.34.02    Terminology Used Inconsistent with Accepted Meaning

Where applicant acts as his or her own lexicographer to specifically define a term of a claim contrary to its ordinary meaning, the written description must clearly redefine the claim term and set forth the uncommon definition so as to put one reasonably skilled in the art on notice that the applicant intended to so redefine that claim term. _Process Control Corp. v. HydReclaim Corp._, 190 F.3d 1350, 1357, 52 USPQ2d 1029, 1033 (Fed. Cir. 1999). The term "**[1]**" in claim **[2]** is used by the claim to mean "**[3]**," while the accepted meaning is "**[4]**." The term is indefinite because the specification does not clearly redefine the term.

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 3, point out the meaning that is assigned to the term by applicant’s claims, taking into account the entire disclosure.

2. In bracket 4, point out the accepted meaning of the term. Support for the examiner’s stated accepted meaning should be provided through the citation of an appropriate reference source, e.g., textbook or dictionary. See **[MPEP § 2173.05(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e217839.html)**.

3. This paragraph must be preceded by form paragraph **[7.34.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.34.01.html)**.

4. This paragraph should only be used where the specification does not clearly redefine the claim term at issue.

# ¶ 7.34.03    Relative Term - Term of Degree Rendering Claim Indefinite

The term "**[1]"** in claim **[2]** is a relative term which renders the claim indefinite. The term "**[1]**" is not defined by the claim, the specification does not provide a standard for ascertaining the requisite degree, and one of ordinary skill in the art would not be reasonably apprised of the scope of the invention. **[3]**

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 3, explain which parameter, quantity, or other limitation in the claim has been rendered indefinite by the use of the term appearing in bracket 1.

2. This form paragraph must be preceded by form paragraph **[7.34.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.34.01.html)**.

# ¶ 7.34.04    Broader Range/Limitation And Narrow Range/Limitation in Same Claim

A broad range or limitation together with a narrow range or limitation that falls within the broad range or limitation (in the same claim) may be considered indefinite if the resulting claim does not clearly set forth the metes and bounds of the patent protection desired. See **[MPEP § 2173.05(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e218152.html)**. In the present instance, claim **[1]** recites the broad recitation **[2]**, and the claim also recites **[3]** which is the narrower statement of the range/limitation. The claim(s) are considered indefinite because there is a question or doubt as to whether the feature introduced by such narrower language is (a) merely exemplary of the remainder of the claim, and therefore not required, or (b) a required feature of the claims.

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 2, insert the broader range/limitation and where it appears in the claim; in bracket 3, insert the narrow range/limitation and where it appears. This form paragraph may be modified to fit other instances of indefiniteness in the claims.

2. This form paragraph must be preceded by form paragraph **[7.34.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.34.01.html)**.

# ¶ 7.34.05    Lack of Antecedent Basis in the Claims

Claim **[1]** recites the limitation **[2]** in **[3]**. There is insufficient antecedent basis for this limitation in the claim.

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 2, insert the limitation which lacks antecedent basis, for example --said lever-- or --the lever--.

2. In bracket 3, identify where in the claim(s) the limitation appears, for example, --line 3--, --the 3rd paragraph of the claim--, --the last 2 lines of the claim--, etc.

3. This form paragraph should ONLY be used in aggravated situations where the lack of antecedent basis makes the scope of the claim indeterminate. It must be preceded by form paragraph **[7.34.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.34.01.html)**.

# ¶ 7.34.07    Claims Are a Literal Translation

The claims are generally narrative and indefinite, failing to conform with current U.S. practice. They appear to be a literal translation into English from a foreign document and are replete with grammatical and idiomatic errors.

### Examiner Note:

This form paragraph must be preceded by form paragraph **[7.34.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.34.01.html)**.

# ¶ 7.34.08    Indefinite Claim Language: "For Example"

Regarding claim **[1]**, the phrase "for example" renders the claim indefinite because it is unclear whether the limitation(s) following the phrase are part of the claimed invention. See **[MPEP § 2173.05(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e218251.html)**.

### Examiner Note:

This form paragraph must be preceded by form paragraph **[7.34.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.34.01.html)**.

# ¶ 7.34.09    Indefinite Claim Language: "Or The Like"

Regarding claim **[1]**, the phrase "or the like" renders the claim(s) indefinite because the claim(s) include(s) elements not actually disclosed (those encompassed by "or the like"), thereby rendering the scope of the claim(s) unascertainable. See **[MPEP § 2173.05(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e218251.html)**.

This form paragraph must be preceded by form paragraph **[7.34.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.34.01.html)**.

# ¶ 7.34.10    Indefinite Claim Language: "Such As"

Regarding claim **[1]**, the phrase "such as" renders the claim indefinite because it is unclear whether the limitations following the phrase are part of the claimed invention. See **[MPEP § 2173.05(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e218251.html)**.

# ¶ 7.34.15    Rejection Under 35 U.S.C. 112, Pro Se

Claim **[1]** rejected as failing to define the invention in the manner required by **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**, second paragraph.

The claim(s) are narrative in form and replete with indefinite language. The structure which goes to make up the device must be clearly and positively specified. The structure must be organized and correlated in such a manner as to present a complete operative device. The claim(s) must be in one sentence form only. Note the format of the claims in the patent(s) cited.

# ¶ 7.34.23     Rejections Under 35 U.S.C. 112(b) or pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112, Second Paragraph: Claim Limitation is Interpreted under 35 U.S.C. 112(f) or pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112, Sixth paragraph, but Disclosure of the Structure, Material, or Acts for Performing the Function Recited in a Claim Is Lacking, Insufficient, or Not Clearly Linked

Claim limitation "**[1]**" invokes **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**, sixth paragraph. However, the written description fails to disclose the corresponding structure, material, or acts for performing the entire claimed function and to clearly link the structure, material, or acts to the function. **[2]** Therefore, the claim is indefinite and is rejected under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**, second paragraph.

Applicant may:

- (a) Amend the claim so that the claim limitation will no longer be interpreted as a limitation under **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**, sixth paragraph;
- (b) Amend the written description of the specification such that it expressly recites what structure, material, or acts perform the entire claimed function, without introducing any new matter (**[35 U.S.C. 132(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e303187.html##d0e303192)** ); or
- (c) Amend the written description of the specification such that it clearly links the structure, material, or acts disclosed therein to the function recited in the claim, without introducing any new matter (**[35 U.S.C. 132(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e303187.html##d0e303192)** ).

If applicant is of the opinion that the written description of the specification already implicitly or inherently discloses the corresponding structure, material, or acts and clearly links them to the function so that one of ordinary skill in the art would recognize what structure, material, or acts perform the claimed function, applicant should clarify the record by either:

- (a) Amending the written description of the specification such that it expressly recites the corresponding structure, material, or acts for performing the claimed function and clearly links or associates the structure, material, or acts to the claimed function, without introducing any new matter (**[35 U.S.C. 132(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e303187.html##d0e303192)** ); or
- (b) Stating on the record what the corresponding structure, material, or acts, which are implicitly or inherently set forth in the written description of the specification, perform the claimed function. For more information, see **[37 CFR 1.75(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e320269.html##d0e320295)**  and **[MPEP §§ 608.01(o)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e46173.html)** and **[2181](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e219279.html)**.

### Examiner Note:

1.  In bracket 1, recite the limitation that invokes **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**, sixth paragraph.

2.  In bracket 2, explain why there is insufficient disclosure of the corresponding structure, material, or acts for performing the entire claimed function or why there is no clear linkage between the structure, material, or acts and the function. For example, explain that (i) the disclosure is devoid of any structure that performs the function in the claim, (ii) the structure described in the specification does not perform the entire function in the claim, or (iii) no association between the structure and the function can be found in the specification.

3.  This form paragraph must be preceded by form paragraphs **[7.30.03.h](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.30.03.h.html)**, **[7.30.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.30.03.html)**, and **[7.30.05](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.30.05.html)** (to set forth the claim interpretation and statutory basis for **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**, sixth paragraph), and then **[7.30.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.30.02.html)** or **[7.103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.103.html)** and **[7.34.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.34.01.html)** (to set forth the statutory basis for the indefiniteness rejection and identify the claim at issue) and **[7.30.06](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.30.06.html)**, if appropriate (invoked despite the absence of means).

# ¶ 7.34.24    Rejections under 35 U.S.C. 112(b) or pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112, Second Paragraph: Unclear Whether Claim Limitation Is To Be Interpreted Under 35 U.S.C. 112(f) or pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112, Sixth Paragraph – Result of 3-Prong Test Inconclusive

Claim limitation **[1]** has been evaluated under the three-prong test set forth in **[MPEP § 2181](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e219279.html)**, subsection I, but the result is inconclusive. Thus, it is unclear whether this limitation should be interpreted under **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**, sixth paragraph, because **[2]**. The boundaries of this claim limitation are ambiguous; therefore, the claim is indefinite and is rejected under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**, second paragraph.

In response to this rejection, applicant must clarify whether this limitation should be interpreted under **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**, sixth paragraph.

The "means," generic placeholder, or "step" must be modified by functional language, and must not be modified by sufficient structure, material, or acts for performing the claimed function;
- (b) Present a sufficient showing that **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**, sixth paragraph, should apply because the claim limitation recites a function to be performed and does not recite sufficient structure, material, or acts to perform that function;
- (c) Amend the claim to clearly avoid invoking **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**, sixth paragraph, by deleting the function or by reciting sufficient structure, material or acts to perform the recited function; or
- (d) Present a sufficient showing that **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**, sixth paragraph, does not apply because the limitation does not recite a function or does recite a function along with sufficient structure, material or acts to perform that function.

### Examiner Note:

1.  This paragraph should be used after the examiner has attempted to perform the three-prong analysis from **[MPEP § 2181](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e219279.html)**, subsection I, and is unable to conclude whether the claim limitation should be treated under **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**, sixth paragraph, because of ambiguous words in the claim. This situation should be rare.

2.  In bracket 1, identify the claim and claim limitation that causes the claim to be rejected under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**, second paragraph.

3.  In bracket 2, identify the reason that the three-prong test was inclusive. The possibilities include:

(a) the term "means" or generic placeholder is modified by a word, which is ambiguous regarding whether it conveys structure or function;

(b) the term "step" is modified by a word, which is ambiguous regarding whether it conveys an act or a function;

(c) the claim limitation uses the word "means" or a generic placeholder coupled with functional language, but it is modified by some structure or material that is ambiguous regarding whether that structure or material is sufficient for performing the claimed function;

(d) the claim limitation uses the word "step" coupled with functional language, but it is modified by some act that is ambiguous regarding whether that act is sufficient for performing the claimed function.

4. This form paragraph may also be used in response to an applicant's reply in which applicant disputes the application of **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**, sixth paragraph. See **[MPEP § 706.07(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e69118.html)** for guidance on when the second action may be made final.

5. This form paragraph must be preceded by form paragraphs **[7.30.03.h](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.30.03.h.html)**, **[7.30.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.30.03.html)**, and **[7.30.05](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.30.05.html)** (to set forth the claim interpretation and statutory basis for **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**, sixth paragraph), and then **[7.30.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.30.02.html)** or **[7.103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.103.html)** and **[7.34.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.34.01.html)** (to set forth the statutory basis for the indefiniteness rejection).

# ¶ 7.35    Rejection, 35 U.S.C. 112(b) or pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112, 2nd Paragraph, Failure To Particularly Point out and Distinctly Claim - Omnibus Claim

Claim **[1]** rejected under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**, second paragraph, as being indefinite in that it fails to point out what is included or excluded by the claim language. This claim is an omnibus type claim.

### Examiner Note:

1. This rejection must be preceded by form paragraph **[7.30.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.30.02.html)** or **[7.103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.103.html)**.

2. Use this paragraph to reject an "omnibus" type claim. No further explanation is necessary.

3. An example of an omnibus claim is: "A device substantially as shown and described."

# ¶ 7.35.01    Trademark or Trade Name as a Limitation in the Claim

Claim **[1]** contains the trademark/trade name **[2]**. Where a trademark or trade name is used in a claim as a limitation to identify or describe a particular material or product, the claim does not comply with the requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**, second paragraph. See _Ex parte Simpson_, 218 USPQ 1020 (Bd. App. 1982). The claim scope is uncertain since the trademark or trade name cannot be used properly to identify any particular material or product. A trademark or trade name is used to identify a source of goods, and not the goods themselves. Thus, a trademark or trade name does not identify or describe the goods associated with the trademark or trade name. In the present case, the trademark/trade name is used to identify/describe **[3]** and, accordingly, the identification/description is indefinite.

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 2, insert the trademark/trade name and where it is used in the claim.

2. In bracket 3, specify the material or product which is identified or described in the claim by the trademark/trade name.

# ¶ 7.36    Statement of Statutory Basis, 35 U.S.C. 112(d) and Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112, Fourth Paragraph

The following is a quotation of **[35 U.S.C. 112(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae73_319)**:

> (d) REFERENCE IN DEPENDENT FORMS.—Subject to subsection (e), a claim in dependent form shall contain a reference to a claim previously set forth and then specify a further limitation of the subject matter claimed. A claim in dependent form shall be construed to incorporate by reference all the limitations of the claim to which it refers.

The following is a quotation of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**, fourth paragraph:

> Subject to the following paragraph [i.e., the fifth paragraph of pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112], a claim in dependent form shall contain a reference to a claim previously set forth and then specify a further limitation of the subject matter claimed. A claim in dependent form shall be construed to incorporate by reference all the limitations of the claim to which it refers.

### Examiner Note:

1. The statute is no longer being recited in all Office actions. It is only required in first actions on the merits and final rejections. Where the statute is not being cited in an action on the merits, use paragraph **[7.103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.103.html)**.

2. Form paragraph 7.36 is to be used ONLY ONCE in a given Office action.

# ¶ 7.36.01    Rejection under 35 U.S.C. 112(d) or pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112, 4th Paragraph, Improper Dependent Claim

Claim **[1]** rejected under **[35 U.S.C. 112(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae73_319)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112, 4th paragraph](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**, as being of improper dependent form for failing to further limit the subject matter of the claim upon which it depends, or for failing to include all the limitations of the claim upon which it depends. **[2]**. Applicant may cancel the claim(s), amend the claim(s) to place the claim(s) in proper dependent form, rewrite the claim(s) in independent form, or present a sufficient showing that the dependent claim(s) complies with the statutory requirements.

### Examiner Note:

1.  In bracket 2, insert an explanation of what is in the claim and why it does not constitute a further limitation.

2.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit indicated that although the requirements of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**, 4th paragraph, are related to matters of form, non-compliance with **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112, 4th paragraph](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**, renders the claim unpatentable just as non-compliance with other paragraphs of **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**  would. See _Pfizer, Inc. v. Ranbaxy Labs., Ltd._, 457 F.3d 1284, 1291-92, 79 USPQ2d 1583, 1589-90 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (holding a dependent claim in a patent invalid for failure to comply with **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112, 4th paragraph](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)** ). Therefore, if a dependent claim does not comply with the requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 112(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae73_319)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112, 4th paragraph](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**, the dependent claim should be rejected under **[35 U.S.C. 112(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae73_319)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112, 4th paragraph](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**, as unpatentable rather than objecting to the claim.

3.        This form paragraph must be preceded by form paragraph **[7.36](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.36.html)**.

# ¶ 7.37    Arguments Are Not Persuasive

Applicant’s arguments filed **[1]** have been fully considered but they are not persuasive. **[2]**

### Examiner Note:

1. The examiner must address all arguments which have not already been responded to in the statement of the rejection.

2. In bracket 2, provide explanation as to non-persuasiveness.

# ¶ 7.37.01    Unpersuasive Argument: Age of Reference(s)

In response to applicant’s argument based upon the age of the references, contentions that the reference patents are old are not impressive absent a showing that the art tried and failed to solve the same problem notwithstanding its presumed knowledge of the references. See _In re Wright_, 569 F.2d 1124, 193 USPQ 332 (CCPA 1977).

### Examiner Note:

This form paragraph must be preceded by form paragraph 7.37.

# ¶ 7.37.02    Unpersuasive Argument: Bodily Incorporation

In response to applicant’s argument that **[1]**, the test for obviousness is not whether the features of a secondary reference may be bodily incorporated into the structure of the primary reference; nor is it that the claimed invention must be expressly suggested in any one or all of the references. Rather, the test is what the combined teachings of the references would have suggested to those of ordinary skill in the art. See _In re Keller_, 642 F.2d 413, 208 USPQ 871 (CCPA 1981).

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 1, briefly restate applicant’s arguments with respect to the issue of bodily incorporation.

2. This form paragraph must be preceded by form paragraph **[7.37](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.37.html)**.

# ¶ 7.37.03    Unpersuasive Argument: Hindsight Reasoning

In response to applicant’s argument that the examiner’s conclusion of obviousness is based upon improper hindsight reasoning, it must be recognized that any judgment on obviousness is in a sense necessarily a reconstruction based upon hindsight reasoning. But so long as it takes into account only knowledge which was within the level of ordinary skill at the time the claimed invention was made, and does not include knowledge gleaned only from the applicant’s disclosure, such a reconstruction is proper. See _In re McLaughlin_, 443 F.2d 1392, 170 USPQ 209 (CCPA 1971).

### Examiner Note:

This form paragraph must be preceded by form paragraph **[7.37](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.37.html)**.

# ¶ 7.37.04    Unpersuasive Argument: No Teaching, Suggestion, or Motivation To Combine

In response to applicant’s argument that there is no teaching, suggestion, or motivation to combine the references, the examiner recognizes that obviousness may be established by combining or modifying the teachings of the prior art to produce the claimed invention where there is some teaching, suggestion, or motivation to do so found either in the references themselves or in the knowledge generally available to one of ordinary skill in the art. See _In re Fine_, 837 F.2d 1071, 5 USPQ2d 1596 (Fed. Cir. 1988), _In re Jones_, 958 F.2d 347, 21 USPQ2d 1941 (Fed. Cir. 1992), and _KSR International Co. v. Teleflex, Inc_., 550 U.S. 398, 82 USPQ2d 1385 (2007). In this case, **[1]**.

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 1, explain where the teaching, suggestion, or motivation for the rejection is found, either in the references, or in the knowledge generally available to one of ordinary skill in the art.

2. This form paragraph must be preceded by form paragraph **[7.37](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.37.html)**.

# ¶ 7.37.05    Unpersuasive Argument: Nonanalogous Art

In response to applicant’s argument that **[1]** is nonanalogous art, it has been held that a prior art reference must either be in the field of the inventor’s endeavor or, if not, then be reasonably pertinent to the particular problem with which the inventor was concerned, in order to be relied upon as a basis for rejection of the claimed invention. See _In re Oetiker_, 977 F.2d 1443, 24 USPQ2d 1443 (Fed. Cir. 1992). In this case, **[2]**.

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 1, enter the name of the reference which applicant alleges is nonanalogous.

2. In bracket 2, explain why the reference is analogous art.

3. This form paragraph must be preceded by form paragraph **[7.37](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.37.html)**.

# ¶ 7.37.06    Unpersuasive Argument: Number of References

In response to applicant’s argument that the examiner has combined an excessive number of references, reliance on a large number of references in a rejection does not, without more, weigh against the obviousness of the claimed invention. See _In re Gorman_, 933 F.2d 982, 18 USPQ2d 1885 (Fed. Cir. 1991).

### Examiner Note:

This form paragraph must be preceded by form paragraph **[7.37](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.37.html)**.

# ¶ 7.37.07    Unpersuasive Argument: The Invention Obtains Result Not Contemplated by Prior Art

In response to applicant’s argument that **[1]**, the fact that the inventor has recognized another advantage which would flow naturally from following the suggestion of the prior art cannot be the basis for patentability when the differences would otherwise be obvious. See _Ex parte Obiaya_, 227 USPQ 58, 60 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1985).

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 1, briefly restate applicant’s arguments with respect to the issue of results not contemplated by the prior art.

2. This form paragraph must be preceded by form paragraph **[7.37](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.37.html)**.

# ¶ 7.37.08    Unpersuasive Argument: Arguing Limitations Which Are Not Claimed

In response to applicant’s argument that the references fail to show certain features of the invention, it is noted that the features upon which applicant relies (i.e., **[1]**) are not recited in the rejected claim(s). Although the claims are interpreted in light of the specification, limitations from the specification are not read into the claims. See _In re Van Geuns_, 988 F.2d 1181, 26 USPQ2d 1057 (Fed. Cir. 1993).

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 1, recite the features upon which applicant relies, but which are not recited in the claim(s).

2. This form paragraph must be preceded by form paragraph **[7.37](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.37.html)**.

# ¶ 7.37.09    Unpersuasive Argument: Intended Use

In response to applicant’s argument that **[1]**, a recitation of the intended use of the claimed invention must result in a structural difference between the claimed invention and the prior art in order to patentably distinguish the claimed invention from the prior art. If the prior art structure is capable of performing the intended use, then it meets the claim.

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 1, briefly restate applicant’s arguments with respect to the issue of intended use.

2. This form paragraph must be preceded by form paragraph **[7.37](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.37.html)**.

# ¶ 7.37.10    Unpersuasive Argument: Limitation(s) in Preamble

Applicant’s arguments rely on language solely recited in preamble recitations in claim(s) **[1]**. When reading the preamble in the context of the entire claim, the recitation **[2]** is not limiting because the body of the claim describes a complete invention and the language recited solely in the preamble does not provide any distinct definition of any of the claimed invention’s limitations. Thus, the preamble of the claim(s) is not considered a limitation and is of no significance to claim construction. See _Pitney Bowes, Inc. v. Hewlett-Packard Co._, 182 F.3d 1298, 1305, 51 USPQ2d 1161, 1165 (Fed. Cir. 1999). See **[MPEP § 2111.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e200689.html)**.

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 1, identify the claim(s) the applicant’s unpersuasive argument addresses.

2. In bracket 2, briefly restate the recitation about which applicant is arguing.

3. This form paragraph must be preceded by form paragraph **[7.37](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.37.html)**.

# ¶ 7.37.11    Unpersuasive Argument: General Allegation of Patentability

Applicant’s arguments fail to comply with **[37 CFR 1.111(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e322449.html)**  because they amount to a general allegation that the claims define a patentable invention without specifically pointing out how the language of the claims patentably distinguishes them from the references.

### Examiner Note:

This form paragraph must be preceded by form paragraph **[7.37](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.37.html)**.

# ¶ 7.37.12    Unpersuasive Argument: Novelty Not Clearly Pointed Out

Applicant’s arguments do not comply with **[37 CFR 1.111(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e322449.html)**  because they do not clearly point out the patentable novelty which he or she thinks the claims present in view of the state of the art disclosed by the references cited or the objections made. Further, they do not show how the amendments avoid such references or objections.

### Examiner Note:

This form paragraph must be preceded by form paragraph **[7.37](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.37.html)**.

# ¶ 7.37.13    Unpersuasive Argument: Arguing Against References Individually

In response to applicant’s arguments against the references individually, one cannot show nonobviousness by attacking references individually where the rejections are based on combinations of references. See _In re Keller_, 642 F.2d 413, 208 USPQ 871 (CCPA 1981); _In re Merck_ & _Co.,_ 800 F.2d 1091, 231 USPQ 375 (Fed. Cir. 1986).

### Examiner Note:

This form paragraph must be preceded by form paragraph **[7.37](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.37.html)**.

# ¶ 7.38    Arguments Are Moot Because of New Ground of Rejection

Applicant’s arguments with respect to claim(s) **[1]** have been considered but are moot because the new ground of rejection does not rely on any reference applied in the prior rejection of record for any teaching or matter specifically challenged in the argument.

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 1, insert the claim number(s).

2. The examiner must, however, address any arguments presented by the applicant which are still relevant to any references being applied.

# ¶ 7.38.01    Arguments Persuasive, Previous Rejection/Objection Withdrawn

Applicant’s arguments, see [**1**], filed [**2**], with respect to [**3**] have been fully considered and are persuasive. The [**4**] of [**5**] has been withdrawn.

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 1, identify the page(s) and line number(s) from applicant’s remarks which form the basis for withdrawing the previous rejection/objection.

2. In bracket 3, insert claim number, figure number, the specification, the abstract, etc.

3. In bracket 4, insert rejection or objection.

4. In bracket 5, insert claim number, figure number, the specification, the abstract, etc.

# ¶ 7.38.02    Arguments Persuasive, New Ground(s) of Rejection

Applicant’s arguments, see [**1**], filed [**2**], with respect to the rejection(s) of claim(s) [**3**] under [**4**] have been fully considered and are persuasive. Therefore, the rejection has been withdrawn. However, upon further consideration, a new ground(s) of rejection is made in view of [**5**].

### Examiner Note:

# ¶ 7.39.01    Final Rejection, Options for Applicant, Pro Se

This action is a **final rejection** and closes the prosecution of this application. Applicant’s reply under **[37 CFR 1.113](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e322575.html)**  to this action is limited to an appeal to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, an amendment complying with the requirements set forth below, or a request for continued examination (RCE) to reopen prosecution where permitted. Please note that the Office also offers initiatives that are available to applicants after the close of prosecution. See **[www.uspto.gov/patents/initiatives/ uspto-patent-application-initiatives-timeline](https://www.uspto.gov/patents/initiatives/uspto-patent-application-initiatives-timeline)**  for more information.

General information on the Patent Trial and Appeal Board is available at: **[www.uspto.gov/patents/ptab](https://www.uspto.gov/patents/ptab)**. The information at this page includes guidance on time limited options that may assist the applicant contemplating appealing an examiner’s rejection. It also includes information on pro bono (free) legal services and advice available for those who are under-resourced and considering an appeal at: **[www.uspto.gov/patents/ptab/free-legal-assistance](https://www.uspto.gov/patents/ptab/free-legal-assistance)**. The page is best reviewed promptly after applicant has received a final rejection or the claims have been twice rejected because some of the noted assistance must be requested within one month from the date of the latest rejection. See **[MPEP § 1204](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e122522.html)** for more information on filing a notice of appeal.

If applicant should desire to appeal any rejection made by the examiner, a Notice of Appeal must be filed within the period for reply. The Notice of Appeal must be accompanied by the fee required by **[37 CFR 41.20(b)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e356279.html##ar_d1fcab_2724e_251)**. The current fee amount is available at: **[www.uspto.gov/Fees](https://www.uspto.gov/Fees)**.

If applicant should desire to file an after-final amendment, entry of the proposed amendment cannot be made as a matter of right unless it merely cancels claims or complies with a formal requirement made in a previous Office action. Amendments touching the merits of the application which otherwise might not be proper may be admitted upon a showing of good and sufficient reasons why they are necessary and why they were not presented earlier.

A reply under **[37 CFR 1.113](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e322575.html)**  to a final rejection must include cancellation of or appeal from the rejection of, each rejected claim. The filing of an amendment after final rejection, whether or not it is entered, does not stop the running of the statutory period for reply to the final rejection unless the examiner holds all of the claims to be in condition for allowance.

If applicant should desire to continue prosecution in a utility or plant application filed on or after May 29, 2000 and have the finality of this Office action withdrawn, an RCE under **[37 CFR 1.114](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e322625.html)**  may be filed within the period for reply. See **[MPEP § 706.07(h)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e70778.html)** for more information on the requirements for filing an RCE.

The application will become abandoned unless a Notice of Appeal, an after final reply that places the application in condition for allowance, or an RCE has been filed properly within the period for reply, or any extension of this period obtained under either **[37 CFR 1.136(a) or (b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e323655.html)**.

# ¶ 7.41.03    Action Is Final, First Action Following Submission Under 37 CFR 1.53(d), Continued Prosecution Application (CPA) in a Design Application

All claims are identical to or patentably indistinct from the invention claimed in the parent application prior to the filing of this Continued Prosecution Application under **[37 CFR 1.53(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e318681.html)**  (that is, restriction would not be proper) and could have been finally rejected on the grounds and art of record in the next Office action. Accordingly, **THIS ACTION IS MADE FINAL** even though it is a first action after the filing under **[37 CFR 1.53(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e318681.html)**. Applicant is reminded of the extension of time policy as set forth in **[37 CFR 1.136(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e323655.html)**.

A shortened statutory period for reply to this final action is set to expire THREE MONTHS from the mailing date of this action. In the event a first reply is filed within TWO MONTHS of the mailing date of this final action and the advisory action is not mailed until after the end of the THREE-MONTH shortened statutory period, then the shortened statutory period will expire on the date the advisory action is mailed, and any extension fee pursuant to **[37 CFR 1.136(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e323655.html)**  will be calculated from the mailing date of the advisory action. In no event, however, will the statutory period for reply expire later than SIX MONTHS from the mailing date of this final action.

### Examiner Note:

1. This form paragraph is for a first action final rejection in a Continued Prosecution Application filed under **[37 CFR 1.53(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e318681.html)**  (design applications only).

# ¶ 7.42    Withdrawal of Finality of Last Office Action

Applicant’s request for reconsideration of the finality of the rejection of the last Office action is persuasive and, therefore, the finality of that action is withdrawn.

# ¶ 7.42.01.fti    Withdrawal of Finality of Last Office Action - Transitional Application Under 37 CFR 1.129(a)

Since this application is eligible for the transitional procedure of **[37 CFR 1.129(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e323341.html##d0e323349)**, and the fee set forth in **[37 CFR 1.17(r)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//eff_20130320_d0e315199.html##eff_20130320_d0e315820)**  has been timely paid, the finality of the previous Office action has been withdrawn pursuant to **[37 CFR 1.129(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e323341.html##d0e323349)**.

Since the submission appears to be a _bona fide_ attempt to provide a complete reply to the prior Office action, applicant is given a shortened statutory period of TWO MONTHS from the mailing date of this letter to submit a complete reply. This shortened statutory period supersedes the time period set in the prior Office action. This time period may be extended pursuant to **[37 CFR 1.136(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e323655.html##d0e323663)**.

The appeal stands dismissed.

### Examiner Note:

The reasons why the examiner considers the submission not to be fully responsive must be set forth in bracket 2.

Accordingly, **THIS ACTION IS MADE FINAL** even though it is a first action after the submission under **[37 CFR 1.129(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e323341.html##d0e323349)**. See **[MPEP § 706.07(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e69408.html)**. Applicant is reminded of the extension of time policy as set forth in **[37 CFR 1.136(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e323655.html##d0e323663)**.

A shortened statutory period for reply to this final action is set to expire THREE MONTHS from the mailing date of this action. In the event a first reply is filed within TWO MONTHS of the mailing date of this final action and the advisory action is not mailed until after the end of the THREE-MONTH shortened statutory period, then the shortened statutory period will expire on the date the advisory action is mailed, and any extension fee pursuant to **[37 CFR 1.136(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e323655.html##d0e323663)**  will be calculated from the mailing date of the advisory action.

Under existing Office second action final practice, such an Office action on the merits will be made final, except where the examiner introduces a new ground of rejection that is neither necessitated by applicant’s amendment of the claims nor based on information submitted in an information disclosure statement filed during the period set forth in **[37 CFR 1.97(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e321609.html##d0e321653)**  with the fee set forth in **[37 CFR 1.17(p)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//eff_20130320_d0e315199.html##eff_20130320_d0e315775)**. See **[MPEP § 706.07(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e69118.html)**.

In this Office action, there is no new ground of rejection that was not necessitated by applicant’s amendment of the claims or based on information submitted in an information disclosure statement filed during the period set forth in **[37 CFR 1.97(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e321609.html##d0e321653)**  with the fee set forth in **[37 CFR 1.17(p)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//eff_20130320_d0e315199.html##eff_20130320_d0e315775)**. Accordingly, **THIS ACTION IS MADE FINAL**. Applicant is reminded of the extension of time policy as set forth in **[37 CFR 1.136(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e323655.html##d0e323663)**.

A shortened statutory period for reply to this final action is set to expire THREE MONTHS from the mailing date of this action. In the event a first reply is filed within TWO MONTHS of the mailing date of this final action and the advisory action is not mailed until after the end of the THREE-MONTH shortened statutory period, then the shortened statutory period will expire on the date the advisory action is mailed, and any extension fee pursuant to **[37 CFR 1.136(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e323655.html##d0e323663)**  will be calculated from the mailing date of the advisory action.

# ¶ 7.42.06    Continued Examination Under 37 CFR 1.114 After Appeal But Before A Board Decision

A request for continued examination under **[37 CFR 1.114](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e322625.html)**  was filed in this application after appeal to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, but prior to a decision on the appeal. Since this application is eligible for continued examination under **[37 CFR 1.114](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e322625.html)**  and the fee set forth in **[37 CFR 1.17(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//eff_20130320_d0e315199.html)**  has been timely paid, the appeal has been withdrawn pursuant to **[37 CFR 1.114](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e322625.html)**  and prosecution in this application has been reopened pursuant to **[37 CFR 1.114](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e322625.html)**. Applicant’s submission filed on **[1]** has been entered.

### Examiner Note:

1. Use this form paragraph if a request for continued examination (RCE), including the fee set forth in **[37 CFR 1.17(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//eff_20130320_d0e315199.html)**  and a submission, was filed after a Notice of Appeal or an appeal brief, but there has not been a decision on the appeal. Note that it is not necessary for an appeal brief to have been filed.

2. As set forth in **[37 CFR 1.114](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e322625.html)**, a submission may include an information disclosure statement, an amendment to the written description, claims, or drawings, new arguments, or new evidence in support of patentability. The submission may consist of arguments in a previously filed appeal brief or reply brief, or an incorporation of such arguments in the transmittal letter or other paper accompanying the RCE.

3. To be eligible for continued examination under **[37 CFR 1.114](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e322625.html)**, the application must be a utility or plant application filed under **[35 U.S.C. 111(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302673.html)**  on or after June 8, 1995, or an international application filed under **[35 U.S.C. 363](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e306994.html)**  on or after June 8, 1995 that complies with **[35 U.S.C. 371](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e307164.html)**. The RCE must be filed on or after May 29, 2000.

# ¶ 7.42.07    Continued Examination under 37 CFR 1.114 after Board Decision but Before Further Appeal or Civil Action

A request for continued examination under **[37 CFR 1.114](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e322625.html)**  was filed in this application after a decision by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, but before the filing of a Notice of Appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit or the commencement of a civil action. Since this application is eligible for continued examination under **[37 CFR 1.114](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e322625.html)**  and the fee set forth in **[37 CFR 1.17(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//eff_20130320_d0e315199.html)**  has been timely paid, the appeal has been withdrawn pursuant to **[37 CFR 1.114](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e322625.html)**  and prosecution in this application has been reopened pursuant to **[37 CFR 1.114](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e322625.html)**. Applicant’s submission filed on **[1]** has been entered.

### Examiner Note:

1. Use this form paragraph if a request for continued examination (RCE), including the fee set forth in **[37 CFR 1.17(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//eff_20130320_d0e315199.html)**  and a submission, was timely filed after a decision by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board but before further appeal or civil action. Generally, the deadline for filing a notice of appeal to the Federal Circuit or for commencing a civil action is sixty-three (63) days after the date of the final Board decision. See **[37 CFR 90.3](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//ar_d1d85b_16063_379.html)**  and **[MPEP § 1216](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e130429.html)**.

2. A Patent Trial and Appeal Board decision in an application has _res judicata_ effect and is the "law of the case" and is thus controlling in that application and any subsequent, related application. Therefore, a submission containing arguments without either an amendment of the rejected claims or the submission of a showing of facts will not be effective to remove such rejection. See **[MPEP § 2190](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e220656.html)**, subsection II.

3. To be eligible for continued examination under **[37 CFR 1.114](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e322625.html)**, the application must be a utility or plant application filed under **[35 U.S.C. 111(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302673.html)**  on or after June 8, 1995, or an international application filed under **[35 U.S.C. 363](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e306994.html)**  on or after June 8, 1995 that complies with **[35 U.S.C. 371](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e307164.html)**. The RCE must be filed on or after May 29, 2000.

Receipt is acknowledged of a request for continued examination under **[37 CFR 1.114](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e322625.html)**, including the fee set forth in **[37 CFR 1.17(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//eff_20130320_d0e315199.html)**  and a submission, filed on **[1]**. The submission, however, is not fully responsive to the prior Office action because **[2]**. Since the submission appears to be a _bona fide_ attempt to provide a complete reply to the prior Office action, applicant is given a shortened statutory period of **TWO (2) MONTHS** from the mailing date of this letter to submit a complete reply. This shortened statutory period for reply supersedes the time period set in the prior Office action. This time period may be extended pursuant to **[37 CFR 1.136(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e323655.html)**. In no case can any extension carry the date for reply to this letter beyond the maximum period of SIX MONTHS set by statute (**[35 U.S.C. 133](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e303207aia.html)** ).

### Examiner Note:

1. Use this form paragraph to acknowledge an RCE filed with the fee and a submission where the submission is not fully responsive to the prior Office action. This form paragraph may be used for any RCE filed with a submission which is not fully responsive, i.e., an RCE filed after final rejection, after allowance, after an Office action under _Ex parte Quayle_, 25 USPQ 74, 453 OG 213 (Comm’r Pat. 1935), or after appeal.

2. In bracket 2, identify the reasons why the examiner considers the submission not to be fully responsive.

3. To be eligible for continued examination under **[37 CFR 1.114](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e322625.html)**, the application must be a utility or plant application filed under **[35 U.S.C. 111(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302673.html)**  on or after June 8, 1995, or an international application filed under **[35 U.S.C. 363](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e306994.html)**  on or after June 8, 1995 that complies with **[35 U.S.C. 371](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e307164.html)**. The RCE must be filed on or after May 29, 2000.

# ¶ 7.42.08.AE    Request for Continued Examination With Submission Filed Under 37 CFR 1.114 Which Is Not Fully Responsive - Application Under Accelerated Examination

Receipt is acknowledged of a request for continued examination under **[37 CFR 1.114](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e322625.html)**, including the fee set forth in **[37 CFR 1.17(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//eff_20130320_d0e315199.html##eff_20130320_d0e315324)**  and a submission, filed on **[1]**. The submission, however, is not fully responsive to the prior Office action because **[2]**. Since the submission appears to be a _bona fide_ attempt to provide a complete reply to the prior Office action, applicant is given a shortened statutory period of **TWO (2) MONTHS** from the mailing date of this letter, to submit a complete reply. This shortened statutory period for reply supersedes the time period set in the prior Office action. This application has been granted special status under the accelerated examination program. Extensions of this time period may be granted under **[37 CFR 1.136(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e323655.html##d0e323663)**. However, filing a petition for extension of time will result in the application being taken out of the accelerated examination program. In no case can any extension carry the date for reply to this letter beyond the maximum period of SIX MONTHS set by statute (**[35 U.S.C. 133](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e303207aia.html)** ).

The objective of the accelerated examination program is to complete the examination of an application within twelve months from the filing date of the application. To meet that objective, any reply must be filed electronically via the USPTO patent electronic filing system so that the papers will be expeditiously processed and considered. If the reply is not filed electronically via the USPTO patent electronic filing system, the final disposition of the application may occur later than twelve months from the filing of the application.

### Examiner Note:

1. Use this form paragraph to acknowledge an RCE filed with the fee and a submission where the submission is not fully responsive to the prior Office action. This form paragraph may be used for any RCE filed with a submission which is not fully responsive, i.e., an RCE filed after final rejection, after allowance, after an Office action under _Ex parte Quayle_, 25 USPQ 74, 453 OG 213 (Comm’r Pat. 1935), or after appeal.

# ¶ 7.42.09    Action Is Final, First Action Following Request for Continued Examination under 37 CFR 1.114

All claims are identical to, patentably indistinct from, or have unity of invention with the claims in the application prior to the entry of the submission under **[37 CFR 1.114](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e322625.html)**  (that is, restriction (including a lack of unity of invention) would not be proper) and all claims could have been finally rejected on the grounds and art of record in the next Office action if they had been entered in the application prior to entry under **[37 CFR 1.114](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e322625.html)**. Accordingly, **THIS ACTION IS MADE FINAL** even though it is a first action after the filing of a request for continued examination and the submission under **[37 CFR 1.114](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e322625.html)**.

A shortened statutory period for reply to this final action is set to expire THREE MONTHS from the mailing date of this action. In the event a first reply is filed within TWO MONTHS of the mailing date of this final action and the advisory action is not mailed until after the end of the THREE-MONTH shortened statutory period, then the shortened statutory period will expire on the date the advisory action is mailed, and any extension fee pursuant to **[37 CFR 1.136(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e323655.html)**  will be calculated from the mailing date of the advisory action. In no event, however, will the statutory period for reply expire later than SIX MONTHS from the mailing date of this final action.

### Examiner Note:

This form paragraph is for a first action final rejection following a Request for Continued Examination filed under **[37 CFR 1.114](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e322625.html)**.

# ¶ 7.42.13    Application on Appeal, Request for Continued Examination under 37 CFR 1.114 Without Fee; Claim Allowed

A request for continued examination under **[37 CFR 1.114](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e322625.html)**, including a submission, was filed in this application on **[1]** after appeal to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board. Therefore, the appeal has been withdrawn pursuant to **[37 CFR 1.114](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e322625.html)**. The request, however, lacks the fee required by **[37 CFR 1.17(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//eff_20130320_d0e315199.html##eff_20130320_d0e315324)**. Therefore, the submission has not been entered. See **[37 CFR 1.116(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e322826.html##d0e322881)**. Since the proceedings as to the rejected claims are considered terminated, the application will be passed to issue on allowed claim**[2]**. Claim**[3]** been canceled. See **[MPEP § 1215.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e129941.html)**.

### Examiner Note:

1. If a request for continued examination, including the submission, was filed after a Notice of Appeal or an appeal brief but before a decision on the appeal, and the request lacks the required fee, use this form paragraph to withdraw the appeal and pass the application to issue on the allowed claims.

2. In bracket 3, insert the claim number(s) of the claim(s) which has/have been canceled followed by either --has-- or --have--. Claims which have been indicated as containing allowable subject matter but are objected to as being dependent upon a rejected claim are to be considered as if they were rejected and therefore are to be canceled along with the rejected claims. See **[MPEP § 1215.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e129941.html)**.

3. This form paragraph should be used with the mailing of a Notice of Allowability.

Therefore, the submission has not been entered. See **[37 CFR 1.116(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e322826.html##d0e322881)**. The proceedings as to the rejected claims are considered terminated, and the application will be passed to issue on allowed claim**[2]** provided the following formal matters are promptly corrected: **[3]**. Prosecution is otherwise closed. See **[MPEP § 1215.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e129941.html)**. Applicant is required to make the necessary corrections addressing the outstanding formal matters within a shortened statutory period set to expire **TWO (2) MONTHS** from the mailing date of this letter. Extensions of time may be granted under **[37 CFR 1.136](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e323655.html)**  but in no case can any extension carry the date for reply to this letter beyond the maximum period of SIX MONTHS set by statute (**[35 U.S.C. 133](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e303207aia.html)** ).

### Examiner Note:

1. If a request for continued examination, including a submission, was filed after a Notice of Appeal or an appeal brief but before a decision on the appeal, and the request lacks the fee required by **[37 CFR 1.17(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//eff_20130320_d0e315199.html##eff_20130320_d0e315324)**, use this form paragraph to withdraw the appeal if there are allowed claims but outstanding formal matters need to be corrected.

2. In bracket 3, explain the formal matters that must be corrected.

3. To be eligible for continued examination under **[37 CFR 1.114](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e322625.html)**, the application must be a utility or plant application filed under **[35 U.S.C. 111(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//pltd0e302673aia.html##pltd0e302678aia)**  on or after June 8, 1995, or an international application filed under **[35 U.S.C. 363](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e306994.html)**  on or after June 8, 1995 that complies with **[35 U.S.C. 371](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e307164.html)**. The RCE must be filed on or after May 29, 2000.

# ¶ 7.42.15    Continued Prosecution Application Treated as Continued Examination under 37 CFR 1.114

The request for a continued prosecution application (CPA) under **[37 CFR 1.53(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//aia_d0e318681.html##aia_d0e318862)**  filed on **[1]** is acknowledged. A CPA may only be filed in a design application filed under **[35 U.S.C. chapter 16](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e304465.html)**. See **[37 CFR 1.53(d)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e318681.html)**. Since a CPA of this application is not permitted under **[37 CFR 1.53(d)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//aia_d0e318681.html##aia_d0e318868)**, the improper request for a CPA is being treated as a request for continued examination of this application under **[37 CFR 1.114](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e322625.html)**.

### Examiner Note:

1. Use this form paragraph to advise the applicant that a CPA is being treated as an RCE.

2. Also use form paragraph **[7.42.04](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.42.04.html)**, **[7.42.05](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.42.05.html)**, **[7.42.06](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.42.06.html)**, or **[7.42.07](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.42.07.html)** as applicable, to acknowledge entry of applicant’s submission if the fee set forth in **[37 CFR 1.17(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//eff_20130320_d0e315199.html)**  has been timely paid.

3. If the fee set forth in **[37 CFR 1.17(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//eff_20130320_d0e315199.html##eff_20130320_d0e315324)**  and/or a submission as required by **[37 CFR 1.114](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e322625.html)**  is/are missing and the application is not under appeal, a Notice of Improper Request for Continued Examination should be mailed. If the application is under appeal and the fee set forth in **[37 CFR 1.17(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//eff_20130320_d0e315199.html)**  and/or submission is/are missing, this form paragraph should be followed with one of form paragraphs **[7.42.10](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.42.10.html)** - **[7.42.14](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.42.14.html)**, as applicable.

# ¶ 7.42.16    After Board Decision But Before Further Appeal Or Civil Action, Request for Continued Examination Under 37 CFR 1.114 Without Submission and/or Fee

A request for continued examination (RCE) under **[37 CFR 1.114](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e322625.html)**  was filed in this application on **[1]** after a decision by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, but before the filing of a Notice of Appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit or the commencement of a civil action. The request, however, lacks the fee required by **[37 CFR 1.17(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//eff_20130320_d0e315199.html##eff_20130320_d0e315324)**  and/or the submission required by **[37 CFR 1.114](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e322625.html)**. Accordingly, the RCE is improper and any time period running was not tolled by the filing of the improper request.

### Examiner Note:

1. This form paragraph should be used with the mailing of a Notice of Allowability or a Notice of Abandonment, as appropriate, if the time for seeking court review has passed without such review being sought, or it should be used on a PTOL-90 if time still remains.

2. This form paragraph should not be used if the application is not a utility application or a plant application filed under **[35 U.S.C. 111(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//pltd0e302673aia.html##pltd0e302678aia)**  on or after June 8, 1995, or an international application filed under **[35 U.S.C. 363](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e306994.html)**  on or after June 8, 1995 that complies with **[35 U.S.C. 371](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e307164.html)**. In that situation, a "Notice of Improper Request for Continued Examination (RCE)," Form PTO-2051, should be prepared and mailed by the technical support personnel to notify applicant that continued examination does not apply to the application.

3. In general, if a submission was filed with the improper RCE in this situation, it should not be entered. An exception exists for an amendment that obviously places the application in condition for allowance. See **[MPEP § 1214.07](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e129748.html)**. The examiner should also include a statement as to whether or not any such submission has been entered (e.g., "The submission filed with the improper RCE has not been entered.").

# ¶ 7.43    Objection to Claims, Allowable Subject Matter

Claim **[1]** objected to as being dependent upon a rejected base claim, but would be allowable if rewritten in independent form including all of the limitations of the base claim and any intervening claims.

1. In bracket 2, insert --is-- or --are--.

2. In bracket 3, insert complete text of suggested claim(s).

# ¶ 7.44    Claimed Subject Matter Not in Specification

The specification is objected to as failing to provide proper antecedent basis for the claimed subject matter. See **[37 CFR 1.75(d)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e320269.html)**  and **[MPEP § 608.01(o)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e46173.html)**. Correction of the following is required: **[1]**

3. In bracket 3, insert --has-- or --s have--.

# ¶ 7.46    Preliminary Amendment Unduly Interferes with the Preparation of an Office Action

The preliminary amendment filed on **[1]** was not entered because entry of the amendment would unduly interfere with the preparation of the Office action. See **[37 CFR 1.115(b)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e322734.html)**. The examiner spent a significant amount of time on the preparation of an Office action before the preliminary amendment was received. On the date of receipt of the amendment, the examiner had completed **[2]**.

Furthermore, entry of the preliminary amendment would require significant additional time on the preparation of the Office action. Specifically, entry of the preliminary amendment would require the examiner to **[3]**.

A responsive reply (under **[37 CFR 1.111](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e322449.html)**  or **[37 CFR 1.113](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e322575.html)**  as appropriate) to this Office action must be timely filed to avoid abandonment.

If this is not a final Office action, applicant may wish to resubmit the amendment along with a responsive reply under **[37 CFR 1.111](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e322449.html)**  to ensure proper entry of the amendment.

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 1, provide the date that the Office received the preliminary amendment (use the date of receipt under **[37 CFR 1.6](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e313447.html)**, not the certificate of mailing date under **[37 CFR 1.8](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e313726.html)** ).

2. In bracket 2, provide an explanation on the state of preparation of the Office action as of the receipt date of the preliminary amendment. For example, where appropriate insert --the claim analysis and the search of prior art of all pending claims-- or --the drafting of the Office action and was waiting for the supervisory patent examiner’s approval--.

3. In bracket 3, provide a brief explanation of how entry of the preliminary amendment would require the examiner to spend significant additional time in the preparation of the Office action. For example, where appropriate insert --conduct prior art search in another classification area that was not previously searched and required-- or --revise the Office action extensively to address the new issues raised and the new claims added in the preliminary amendment--.

# ¶ 7.48.aia    Failure To Present Claims for Interference

Claim **[1]** rejected under pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. **[2]** based upon claim **[3]** of Patent No. **[4]**.

Failure to present claims and/or take necessary steps for interference purposes after notification that interfering subject matter is claimed constitutes a disclaimer of the subject matter. This amounts to a concession that, as a matter of law, the patentee is the first inventor in this country. See _In re Oguie_, 517 F.2d 1382, 186 USPQ 227 (CCPA 1975).

### Examiner Note:

# ¶ 7.51.AE    Quayle Action - Application Under Accelerated Examination

This application is in condition for allowance except for the following formal matters: **[1]**.

Prosecution on the merits is closed in accordance with the practice under _Ex parte Quayle,_ 25 USPQ 74, 453 OG 213 (Comm’r Pat. 1935).

Since this application has been granted special status under the accelerated examination program, a shortened statutory period for reply to this action is set to expire **TWO (2) MONTHS** from the mailing date of this letter. Extensions of this time period may be granted under **[37 CFR 1.136(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e323655.html##d0e323663)**. However, filing a petition for extension of time will result in the application being taken out of the accelerated examination program. In no case can any extension carry the date for reply to this letter beyond the maximum period of SIX MONTHS set by statute (**[35 U.S.C. 133](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e303207aia.html)** ).

The objective of the accelerated examination program is to complete the examination of an application within twelve months from the filing date of the application. To meet that objective, any reply must be filed electronically via the USPTO patent electronic filing system so that the papers will be expeditiously processed and considered. If the reply is not filed electronically via the USPTO patent electronic filing system, the final disposition of the application may occur later than twelve months from the filing of the application.

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 1, insert either --affidavit-- or --declaration--.

2. This form paragraph must be followed by one or more of form paragraphs **[7.58.fti](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.58.fti.html)** to **[7.63.fti](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.63.fti.html)** or a paragraph setting forth proper basis for the insufficiency, such as failure to establish acts performed in this country, or that the scope of the declaration or affidavit is not commensurate with the scope of the claim(s).

# ¶ 7.58.fti    Affidavit or Declaration Under 37 CFR 1.131(a): Ineffective, Claiming Same Invention

The **[1]** reference is a U.S. patent or U.S. patent application publication of a pending or patented application that claims the rejected invention. An affidavit or declaration is inappropriate under **[37 CFR 1.131(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//aia_d0e323504.html)**  when the reference is claiming interfering subject matter as defined in **[37 CFR 41.203(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e359654.html##d0e359662)**, see MPEP Chapter **[2300](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e237627.html)**.

See MPEP Chapter **[2300](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e237627.html)** for information on initiating interference proceedings. If the reference and this application are commonly owned, the reference may be disqualified as prior art by an affidavit or declaration under **[37 CFR 1.131(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e323465.html)**. See **[MPEP § 718](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e93900.html)**.

### Examiner Note:

# ¶ 7.61.fti    Affidavit or Declaration Under 37 CFR 1.131(a): Ineffective, Insufficient Evidence of Conception

The evidence submitted is insufficient to establish a conception of the invention prior to the effective date of the **[1]** reference. While conception is the mental part of the inventive act, it must be capable of proof, such as by demonstrative evidence or by a complete disclosure to another. Conception is more than a vague idea of how to solve a problem. The requisite means themselves and their interaction must also be comprehended. See _Mergenthaler v. Scudder_, 1897 C.D. 724, 81 OG 1417 (D.C. Cir. 1897). **[2]**

If either diligence or a reduction to practice is established, a statement to that effect should follow this paragraph.

# ¶ 7.62.fti    Affidavit or Declaration Under 37 CFR 1.131(a): Ineffective, Diligence Lacking

The evidence submitted is insufficient to establish diligence from a date prior to the date of reduction to practice of the **[1]** reference to either a constructive reduction to practice or an actual reduction to practice. **[2]**

### Examiner Note:

1. This form paragraph must be preceded by form paragraph **[7.57.fti](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.57.fti.html)**.

If the affidavit establishes conception, a statement to that effect should be added to this paragraph.

3. If the affidavit additionally fails to establish an alleged reduction to practice prior to the application filing date, this paragraph must be followed by form paragraph **[7.63.fti](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.63.fti.html)**. If such an alleged reduction to practice is established, a statement to that effect should be added to this paragraph.

4. An explanation of the reasons for a holding of non-diligence must be provided in bracket 2.

5. See **[MPEP § 715.07(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e91755.html)** which explains that diligence is not required after reduction to practice.

# ¶ 7.63.fti    Affidavit or Declaration Under 37 CFR 1.131(a): Ineffective, Insufficient Evidence of Actual Reduction to Practice

The evidence submitted is insufficient to establish the inventor’s alleged actual reduction to practice of the invention in this country or a NAFTA or WTO member country after the effective date of the **[1]** reference. **[2]**.

### Examiner Note:

1. This form paragraph must be preceded by form paragraph **[7.57.fti](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.57.fti.html)**.

2. If the alleged reduction to practice is prior to the effective date of the reference, do not use this paragraph. See form paragraph **[7.59.fti](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.59.fti.html)**.

In bracket 4, indicate the rejection that has not been overcome, including the statutory grounds, i.e.: insufficiency of disclosure under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302824.html)**, first paragraph; lack of utility and/or inoperativeness under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302376.html)**; a specific reference applied under **[35 U.S.C. 103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e302450.html)**; etc. See **[MPEP § 716](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e92085.html)**.

5. Following this form paragraph, set forth the reasons for the insufficiency; e.g., categories include: --untimely--; --fails to set forth facts--; --facts presented are not germane to the rejection at issue--;--showing is not commensurate in scope with the claims--; etc. See **[MPEP § 716](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e92085.html)**. Also include a detailed explanation of the reasons why the affidavit or declaration is insufficient. Any of form paragraphs **[7.66.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.66.01.html)** - **[7.66.05](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.66.05.html)** may be used, as appropriate.

# ¶ 7.66.01    Reason Why Affidavit or Declaration Under 37 CFR 1.132 Is Insufficient: Affiant Has Never Seen Invention Before

It includes statements which amount to an affirmation that the affiant has never seen the claimed subject matter before. This is not relevant to the issue of nonobviousness of the claimed subject matter and provides no objective evidence thereof. See **[MPEP § 716](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e92085.html)**.

### Examiner Note:

1. This form paragraph must be preceded by form paragraph **[7.66](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.66.html)**.

2. A full explanation must be provided, if appropriate.

# ¶ 7.66.02    Reason Why Affidavit or Declaration Under 37 CFR 1.132 Is Insufficient: Invention Works as Intended

It includes statements which amount to an affirmation that the claimed subject matter functions as it was intended to function. This is not relevant to the issue of nonobviousness of the claimed subject matter and provides no objective evidence thereof. See **[MPEP § 716](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e92085.html)**.

### Examiner Note:

1. This form paragraph must be preceded by form paragraph **[7.66](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.66.html)**.

2. A full explanation must be provided, if appropriate.

# ¶ 7.66.03    Reason Why Affidavit or Declaration Under 37 CFR 1.132 Is Insufficient: Refers Only to Invention, Not to Claims

It refers only to the system described in the above referenced application and not to the individual claims of the application. As such the declaration does not show that the objective evidence of nonobviousness is commensurate in scope with the claims. See **[MPEP § 716](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e92085.html)**.

### Examiner Note:

1. This form paragraph must be preceded by form paragraph **[7.66](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.66.html)**.

2. A full explanation must be provided, if appropriate.

# ¶ 7.66.04    Reason Why Affidavit or Declaration Under 37 CFR 1.132 Is Insufficient: No Evidence of Long-Felt Need

It states that the claimed subject matter solved a problem that was long standing in the art. However, there is no showing that others of ordinary skill in the art were working on the problem and if so, for how long. In addition, there is no evidence that if persons skilled in the art who were presumably working on the problem knew of the teachings of the above cited references, they would still be unable to solve the problem. See **[MPEP § 716.04](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e93536.html)**.

### Examiner Note:

1. This form paragraph must be preceded by form paragraph **[7.66](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.66.html)**.

2. A full explanation must be provided, if appropriate.

# ¶ 7.66.05    Reason Why Affidavit or Declaration Under 37 CFR 1.132 Is Insufficient: Conclusion

In view of the foregoing, when all of the evidence is considered, the totality of the rebuttal evidence of nonobviousness fails to outweigh the evidence of obviousness.

### Examiner Note:

This form paragraph should be presented as a conclusion to your explanation of why the affidavit or declaration under **[37 CFR 1.132](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e323552.html)**  is insufficient, and it must be preceded by form paragraph **[7.66](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//fp7.66.html)**.

# ¶ 7.82.03    How To Obtain Copies of U.S. Patents and U.S. Patent Application Publications

## Immediately below this section is a citation to U.S. patent(s) and/or U.S. patent application publication(s).

The USPTO does not provide copies of U.S. patents or U.S. patent application publications with Office actions. Reviewing the U.S. patent(s) and/or U.S. patent application publication(s) cited below is important in deciding how to respond to the Office action. To obtain copies of the cited U.S. patent(s) and/or U.S. patent application publication(s), any of the following options may be used, free of charge:

- 1) Patent Center (for all users if this application is published; for registered users associated with this application if this application has not published) — A link to Patent Center is available at **[www.uspto.gov/PatentCenter](https://www.uspto.gov/PatentCenter)**. To obtain the below cited U.S. patent(s) or U.S. patent application publication(s), open Patent Center. Enter the present application number (Application #) in the search box and then select the search button (magnifying glass). Once the "Application Data" is retrieved, select the "Display References" link on the left side of the screen. With the "U.S. Patent Documents" tab selected, select "View" next to the document which cites the desired U.S. patent(s) and/or U.S. patent application publication(s). Select the "PDF" link next to each desired U.S. patent and/or U.S. patent application publication to download the relevant document(s).

To find a U.S. patent or U.S. patent application publication, open the Basic Search feature of the Patent Public Search tool by selecting " Basic Search". Type the U.S. patent or U.S. patent application publication number in the "Quick Lookup" box without any punctuation, letters or symbols (for example, U.S. Patent No. 10,000,000 should be entered as 10000000). Perform any of the below additional formatting may apply:
    
    - i) for U.S. utility patents with a patent number less than one million, add any leading zero(s) before the patent number necessary to make 7 total digits (for example, U.S. Patent No. 123,456 should be entered as 0123456);
    - ii) for U.S. utility and plant patent application publications, make sure to add any leading zero(s) necessary after the year so that the full 11 total digits of the application publication number are provided (for example, U.S. Publ. No. 2021/0123456 should be entered as 20210123456);
    - iii) for U.S. design patents with a patent number greater than or equal to one hundred thousand, type the letter "D" in front of the patent number with no space in between (for example, U.S. Design Patent No. 123,456 should be entered as D123456); and for U.S. design patents with a patent number less than one hundred thousand, type the letter "D" followed immediately, without a space, by the patent number with any leading zero(s) necessary to make 6 total digits (for example, U.S. Design Patent No. 12,345 should be entered as D012345);
    - iv) for U.S. reissue patents, type the letters "RE" followed immediately, without a space, by the patent number with any leading zeros to make 5 total digits (for example, U.S. Reissue Patent No. 1,234 should be entered as RE01234); and
    - v) for U.S. plant patents, type the letters "PP" followed immediately, with a space, by the patent number with any leading zeros to make 5 total digits (for example, U.S. Plant Patent No. 1,234 should be entered as PP01234).
    
    Then select the "Search" button in the "Quick lookup" box. The U.S. patent or U.S. patent application publication will be listed in the "Search results" field at the bottom of the screen.

# ¶ 7.204    Petition Under 37 CFR 1.59(b) To Expunge Information: Decision Held in Abeyance

## In re Application of **[1]** : Appl. No.: **[2]** : RESPONSE TO PETITION Filed: **[3]** : UNDER **[37 CFR 1.59](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e319673.html)**  For: **[4]** :

This is a response to the petition under **[37 CFR 1.59(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e319673.html)**, filed **[5]**, to expunge information from the above identified application.

The decision on the petition will be held in abeyance until allowance of the application or mailing of an _Ex parte Quayle_ action or a Notice of Abandonment, at which time the petition will be decided.

Petitioner requests that a document entitled **[6]**, filed **[7]**, be expunged from the record. Petitioner states either: (A) that the information contains trade secret material, proprietary material and/or material that is subject to a protective order which has not been made public; or (B) that the information submitted was unintentionally submitted and the failure to obtain its return would cause irreparable harm to the party who submitted the information or to the party in interest on whose behalf the information was submitted, and the information has not otherwise been made public. The petition fee set forth in **[37 CFR 1.17(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//eff_20130320_d0e315199.html)**  has been paid.

The decision on the petition is held in abeyance because prosecution on the merits is not closed. Accordingly, it is not appropriate to make a final determination of whether or not the material requested to be expunged is "material," with "materiality" being defined as any information which the examiner considers as being important to a determination of patentability of the claims. Thus, the decision on the petition to expunge must be held in abeyance at this time.

During prosecution on the merits, the examiner will determine whether or not the identified document is considered to be "material." If the information is not considered by the examiner to be material, the information will be removed from the official file.

### Examiner Note:

1. A Technology Center Director decides this petition only if the information was submitted either pursuant to **[MPEP § 724.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e96272.html)** or in an information disclosure statement.

2. The petition should be sent to the Office of Petitions for decision if:

(a) the information was not submitted either pursuant to **[MPEP § 724.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e96272.html)** or in an information disclosure statement.

Some papers entered into the application file, e.g., arguments made in an amendment, may be expunged under appropriate circumstance, however, the petition should be sent to the Office of Petitions for decision; or

(b) the petition is also accompanied by a petition under **[37 CFR 1.183](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e325004.html)**  requesting waiver of one of the requirements explicitly set forth in **[37 CFR 1.59](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=700.html#//d0e319673.html)**  (e.g., requesting expungement of part of the original disclosure).
