# ¶ 2.01    Possible Status as Divisional

This application, which discloses and claims only subject matter disclosed in prior Application No. **[1],** filed **[2]**, appears to claim only subject matter directed to an invention that is independent and distinct from that claimed in the prior application, and names the inventor or at least one joint inventor named in the prior application. Accordingly, this application may constitute a divisional application. Should applicant desire to claim the benefit of the filing date of the prior application, attention is directed to **[35 U.S.C. 120](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e303023313.html)**, **[37 CFR 1.78](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//aia_d0e320662.html)**, and **[MPEP § 211 et seq](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//ch200_d1ff71_1bd25_18b.html)** .

### Examiner Note:

1. In brackets 1 and 2, insert the application number (series code and serial number) and filing date of the prior application, respectively.

2. This form paragraph should only be used if it appears that the application may be a divisional, but a benefit claim has not been properly established.

3. An application claiming the benefit of a provisional application under **[35 U.S.C. 119(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e302921.html)**  should not be called a "divisional" of the prior application.

# ¶ 2.03    Affidavits or Declarations in Prior Application

Applicant refers to an affidavit or declaration filed in the prior application. Affidavits or declarations, such as those submitted under **[37 CFR 1.130](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e323465.html)**, **[1.131](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//aia_d0e323504.html)**  and **[1.132](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e323552.html)**, filed during the prosecution of the prior application do not automatically become a part of this application. Where it is desired to rely on an earlier-filed affidavit or declaration, the applicant should make the remarks of record in this application and include a copy of the original affidavit or declaration filed in the prior application.

### Examiner Note:

This form paragraph is to be used in applications filed under **[37 CFR 1.53(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e318681.html)**. Do not use this form paragraph in applications filed under **[37 CFR 1.53(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e318681.html)**  since affidavits and/or declarations, such as those submitted under **[37 CFR 1.130](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e323465.html)**, **[1.131](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//aia_d0e323504.html)**  and **[1.132](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e323552.html)**  filed during the prosecution of the parent nonprovisional application automatically become a part of the **[37 CFR 1.53(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e318681.html)**  application.

# ¶ 2.05    Possible Status as Continuation

This application discloses and claims only subject matter disclosed in prior Application No. **[1]**, filed **[2**], and names the inventor or at least one joint inventor named in the prior application. Accordingly, this application may constitute a continuation or divisional. Should applicant desire to claim the benefit of the filing date of the prior application, attention is directed to **[35 U.S.C. 120](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e303023313.html)**, **[37 CFR 1.78](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//aia_d0e320662.html)**, and **[MPEP § 211 et seq](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//ch200_d1ff71_1bd25_18b.html)** .

### Examiner Note:

1. In brackets 1 and 2, insert the application number (series code and serial number) and filing date of the prior application, respectively.

2. This form paragraph should only be used if it appears that the application may be a continuation, but a benefit claim has not been properly established.

3. An application claiming the benefit of a provisional application under **[35 U.S.C. 119(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e302921.html)**  should not be called a "continuation" of the provisional application.

# ¶ 2.06    Possible Status as Continuation-in-Part

This application repeats a substantial portion of prior Application No. **[1]**, filed **[2]**, and adds disclosure not presented in the prior application. Because this application names the inventor or at least one joint inventor named in the prior application, it may constitute a continuation-in-part of the prior application. Should applicant desire to claim the benefit of the filing date of the prior application, attention is directed to **[35 U.S.C. 120](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e303023313.html)**, **[37 CFR 1.78](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//aia_d0e320662.html)**, and **[MPEP § 211](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//ch200_d1ff71_1bd25_18b.html)** et seq.

### Examiner Note:

1. In brackets 1 and 2, insert the application number (series code and serial number) and filing date of the prior application, respectively.

2. This form paragraph should only be used if it appears that the application may qualify as a continuation-in-part, but no benefit claim has been properly established.

3. An application claiming the benefit of a provisional application under **[35 U.S.C. 119(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e302921.html)**  should not be called a "continuation-in-part" of the provisional application.

# ¶ 2.07    Definition of a Substitute

Applicant refers to this application as a "substitute" of Application No. **[1]**, filed **[2]**. The term "substitute" is used to designate an application which is in essence the duplicate of an application by the same applicant abandoned before the filing of the later application. A "substitute" does not obtain the benefit of the filing date of the prior application.

# ¶ 2.09    Heading for Conditions for Benefit Claims Under **[35 U.S.C. 119(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e302921.html)**, **[120](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e303023313.html)**, **[121](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e303040912.html)**, **[365(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e307034.html)**, or 386(c)

Applicant’s claim for the benefit of a prior-filed application under **[35 U.S.C. 119(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e302921.html)**  or under **[35 U.S.C. 120](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e303023313.html)**, **[121](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e303040912.html)**, **[365(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e307034.html)**, or **[386(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//al_d225a2_27b56_2ab.html##al_d225a2_29a9c_1b3)**  is acknowledged.

One or more of form paragraphs **[2.10](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//fp2.10.html)** to **[2.11.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//fp2.11.01.html)** or **[2.38](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//fp2.38.html)** to **[2.40](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//fp2.40.html)** must follow depending upon the circumstances.

# ¶ 2.10    Disclosure of Prior-Filed Application Does Not Provide Support for Claimed Subject Matter

The later-filed application must be an application for a patent for an invention which is also disclosed in the prior application (the parent or earlier-filed nonprovisional application or provisional application for which benefit is claimed). The disclosure of the invention in the parent application and in the later-filed application must be sufficient to comply with the requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**  or the first paragraph of **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e302824.html)**, except for the best mode requirement. See _Transco Products, Inc. v. Performance Contracting, Inc_., 38 F.3d 551, 32 USPQ2d 1077 (Fed. Cir. 1994).

The disclosure of the prior-filed application, Application No. **[1]**, fails to provide adequate support or enablement in the manner provided by **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e302673.html##d0e302804)**, first paragraph for one or more claims of this application. **[2]**

### Examiner Note:

1. This form paragraph must be preceded by heading form paragraph **[2.09](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//fp2.09.html)**.

2. This form paragraph may be used when there is lack of support or enablement in the prior-filed application for the claims in the application that is claiming the benefit of the prior-filed application under **[35 U.S.C. 120](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e303023313.html)**, **[121](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e303040912.html)**, **[365(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e307034.html##d0e307053)**, or **[386(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//al_d225a2_27b56_2ab.html##al_d225a2_29a9c_1b3)**  or under **[35 U.S.C. 119(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e302921.html##d0e302951)**. The prior-filed application can be a provisional application, a nonprovisional application, an international application (PCT) that designates the United States, or an international design application that designates the United States.

3. In bracket 1, insert the application number of the prior-filed application.

4. In bracket 2, provide an explanation of lack of support or enablement. If only some of the claims are not entitled to the benefit of the filing date of the prior application, the examiner should include a list of those claims after the explanation (e.g., "Accordingly, claims 1-10 are not entitled to the benefit of the prior application.").

# ¶ 2.10.01    Continuation or Divisional Application Contains New Matter Relative to the Prior-Filed Application

Applicant states that this application is a continuation or divisional application of the prior-filed application. A continuation or divisional application cannot include new matter. Applicant is required to delete the benefit claim or change the relationship (continuation or divisional application) to continuation-in-part because this application contains the following matter not disclosed in the prior-filed application: **[1]**.

### Examiner Note:

1. This form paragraph should be used when an application, which claims the benefit of a prior-filed application under **[35 U.S.C. 120](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e303023313.html)**, **[121](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e303040912.html)**, **[365(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e307034.html##d0e307053)**, or **[386(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//al_d225a2_27b56_2ab.html##al_d225a2_29a9c_1b3)**  contains new matter relative to the prior-filed application, and purports to be a "continuation," "division," or "divisional application" of the prior-filed application. Do not use this form paragraph if the applicant is claiming the benefit of a provisional application under **[35 U.S.C. 119(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e302921.html##d0e302951)**.

2. In bracket 1, provide an example of the matter not disclosed in the prior-filed application.

# ¶ 2.11    Application Must Be Copending With Parent

This application is claiming the benefit of prior-filed application No. **[1]** under **[35 U.S.C. 120](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e303023313.html)**, **[121](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e303040912.html)**, **[365(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e307034.html)**, or **[386(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//al_d225a2_27b56_2ab.html##al_d225a2_29a9c_1b3)**. Copendency between the current application and the prior application is required. Since the applications are not copending, the benefit claim to the prior-filed application is improper. Applicant is required to delete the claim to the benefit of the prior-filed application, unless applicant can establish copendency between the applications.

### Examiner Note:

1. This form paragraph must be preceded by heading form paragraph **[2.09](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//fp2.09.html)**.

2. Do not use this form paragraph for benefit claims under **[35 U.S.C. 119(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e302921.html)**  to provisional applications.

3. In bracket 1, insert the application number of the prior-filed application.

# ¶ 2.11.01    Application Must Be Filed Within 12 Months From the Provisional Application Unless Petition Granted

This application is claiming the benefit of provisional application No. **[1]** under **[35 U.S.C. 119(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e302921.html##d0e302951)**. However, this application was not filed within twelve months from the filing date of the provisional application, and there is no indication of an intermediate nonprovisional application or international application designating the United States that is directly claiming the benefit of the provisional application and filed within 12 months of the filing date of the provisional application. In addition, no petition under 37 CFR 1.78(b) or request under PCT Rule 26_bis_.3 to restore the benefit of the provisional application has been granted.

Applicant is required to delete the claim to the benefit of the prior-filed provisional application, unless applicant can establish that this application, or an intermediate nonprovisional application or international application designating the United States, was filed within 12 months of the filing date of the provisional application. See 35 U.S.C. 119(e)(3). Alternatively, applicant may wish to file a petition to restore the benefit of the provisional application under 37 CFR 1.78 in the subsequent nonprovisional application or international application designating the United States if the subsequent application was filed within two months from the expiration of the twelve-month period and the delay was unintentional. A petition under 37 CFR 1.78(b) to restore the benefit of the provisional application must include: (1) the reference required by 35 U.S.C. 119(e) and 37 CFR 1.78 to the prior-filed provisional application (unless previously submitted); (2) the petition fee set forth in 37 CFR 1.17(m); and (3) a statement that the delay in filing the subsequent nonprovisional application or international application designating the United States within the twelve-month period was unintentional. A petition to restore the benefit of a provisional application must be filed in the subsequent application. The Director may require additional information where there is a question whether the delay was unintentional. The petition should be addressed to: Mail Stop Petition, Commissioner for Patents, P.O. Box 1450, Alexandria, Virginia 22313-1450.

### Examiner Note:

1. This form paragraph must be preceded by heading form paragraph 2.09.

2. In bracket 1, insert the application number of the prior-filed provisional application.

The claim for priority cannot be based on said application, because the subsequent nonprovisional or international application designating the United States was filed more than twelve months thereafter and no petition under **[37 CFR 1.55](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//plt_d0e319215.html)**  or request under **[PCT Rule 26bis.3](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e369679.html##d0e369822)**  to restore the right of priority has been granted.

Applicant may wish to file a petition under **[37 CFR 1.55(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//plt_d0e319215.html)**  to restore the right of priority if the subsequent application was filed within two months from the expiration of the twelve-month period and the delay was unintentional. A petition to restore the right of priority must include: (1) the priority claim under **[35 U.S.C. 119(a)-(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e302921.html)**  or **[(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e302921.html##d0e302991)**, **[365(a) or (b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e307034.html)**, or **[386(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//al_d225a2_27b56_2ab.html##al_d225a2_29a27_324)**  in an application data sheet, identifying the foreign application to which priority is claimed, by specifying the application number, country (or intellectual property authority), day, month, and year of its filing (unless previously submitted); (2) the petition fee set forth in **[37 CFR 1.17(m)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//eff_20130320_d0e315199.html##eff_20130320_d0e315732)**; and (3) a statement that the delay in filing the subsequent application within the twelve-month period was unintentional. The petition to restore the right of priority must be filed in the subsequent application, or in the earliest nonprovisional application claiming benefit under **[35 U.S.C. 120](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e303023313.html)**, **[121](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e303040912.html)**, **[365(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e307034.html##d0e307053)**, or **[386(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//al_d225a2_27b56_2ab.html##al_d225a2_29a9c_1b3)**  to the subsequent application, if such subsequent application is not a nonprovisional application. The Director may require additional information where there is a question whether the delay was unintentional. The petition should be addressed to: Mail Stop Petition, Commissioner for Patents, P.O. Box 1450, Alexandria, Virginia 22313-1450.

1. For problems with foreign priority, see form paragraphs **[2.18](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//fp2.18.html)** to **[2.23](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//fp2.23.html)**.

2. In bracket 1, insert series code and serial no. of parent.

# ¶ 2.30    CPA Status Acceptable (for Design Applications)

The request filed on **[1]** for a Continued Prosecution Application (CPA) under **[37 CFR 1.53(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e318681.html)**  based on parent Application No. **[2]** is acceptable and a CPA has been established. An action on the CPA follows.

### Examiner Note:

1. Use this form paragraph in the first Office action of a CPA to advise the applicant that a request for a CPA is acceptable and that a CPA has been established. This notice should be given, since applicant is not notified of the abandonment of the parent nor is a filing receipt normally sent for a CPA. If the request for a CPA in a utility or plant application is improper and the CPA has been treated as an RCE, do not use this form paragraph (use form paragraph **[7.42.15](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//fp7.42.15.html)** instead). See **[MPEP § 706.07(h)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e70778.html)**.

2. In bracket 1 insert the filing date of the request for a CPA.

However, because the request was not submitted on a separate paper as required by **[37 CFR 1.53(d)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//aia_d0e318681.html##aia_d0e318902)**  , the request is not acceptable and no CPA has been established.

### Examiner Note:

1. Use this form paragraph to inform applicant that a request for a CPA in a design application is not in compliance with **[37 CFR 1.53(d)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//aia_d0e318681.html##aia_d0e318902)**  and, therefore, no CPA has been established.

2. In bracket 1 insert the filing date of the paper containing the request for a CPA.

3. In bracket 2 insert the Application Number identified in the CPA request.

# ¶ 2.32    Request To Delete a Named Inventor in CPA (for Design Applications)

Receipt is acknowledged of the statement requesting that **[1]** be deleted as a named inventor which was filed with the Continued Prosecution Application (CPA) on **[2]**. The inventorship has been corrected as requested.

### Examiner Note:

1. Use this form paragraph where a Continued Prosecution Application (CPA) is filed accompanied by a statement requesting deletion of the name or names of the person or persons who are not inventors of the invention being claimed in the new application. Any request to delete a named inventor in a CPA filed after the CPA is filed must be accompanied by a request under **[37 CFR 1.48](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e317930.html)**.

2. In bracket 1 insert the name or names of the inventor(s) requested to be deleted.

3. In bracket 2 insert the filing date of the CPA.

# ¶ 2.33    New Inventor Identified in CPA (for Design Applications)

It is noted that **[1]** identified as a named inventor in the Continued Prosecution Application (CPA) filed under **[37 CFR 1.53(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e318681.html)**  on **[2]**, but no request under **[37 CFR 1.48](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e317930.html)**, as is required, was filed to correct the inventorship. Any request to add an inventor must be in the form of a request under **[37 CFR 1.48](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e317930.html)**. Otherwise, the inventorship in the CPA shall be the same as in the prior application.

### Examiner Note:

1. Use this form paragraph where a request for a Continued Prosecution Application (CPA) identifies one or more inventors who were not named as inventors in the prior application on the filing date of the CPA.

2. In bracket 1 insert the name or names of the inventor(s) requested to be added followed by either --was-- or --were--, as appropriate.

3. In bracket 2 insert the filing date of the CPA.

# ¶ 2.34    Reference in CPA to Prior Application (by Amendment to the Specification; for Design Applications)

The amendment filed **[1]** requesting that the specification be amended to refer to the present Continued Prosecution Application (CPA) as a **[2]** application of Application No. **[3]** has not been entered. As set forth in **[37 CFR 1.53(d)(7)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e318681.html)**, a request for a CPA is the specific reference required by **[35 U.S.C. 120](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e303023313.html)**  to every application assigned the application number identified in such request. Thus, there is no need to amend the first sentence(s) of the specification to refer back to the prior application and any such amendment shall be denied entry.

### Examiner Note:

1. Use this form paragraph to inform the applicant that an amendment to the first sentence(s) of the specification referring to the CPA as a continuing application of the prior application has not been entered and will not be entered if submitted again.

2. In bracket 1, insert the filing date of the amendment.

3. In bracket 2, insert either --continuation-- or --divisional--.

4. In bracket 3, insert the Application Number of the prior nonprovisional application.

# ¶ 2.35    CPA Status Acceptable - Conditional Request (for Design Applications)

Receipt is acknowledged of the "conditional" request for a Continued Prosecution Application (CPA) filed on **[1]** under **[37 CFR 1.53(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e318681.html)**  based on prior Application No. **[2]**. Any "conditional" request for a CPA submitted as a separate paper is treated as an unconditional request for a CPA. Accordingly, the request for a CPA application is acceptable and a CPA has been established. An action on the CPA follows.

### Examiner Note:

1. Use this form paragraph in the first Office action of a CPA to advise the applicant that a "conditional" request for a CPA is treated as an unconditional request and the CPA is acceptable and that a CPA has been established. This notice should be given, since applicant is not notified of the abandonment of the parent nor is a filing receipt normally sent for a CPA. If the request for a CPA in a utility or plant application is improper and the CPA has been treated as an RCE, do not use this form paragraph (use form paragraph **[7.42.15](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//fp7.42.15.html)** instead). See **[MPEP § 706.07(h)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//d0e70778.html)**.

2. In bracket 1 insert the filing date of the request for a CPA.

See **[37 CFR 1.78](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//aia_d0e320662.html)**. The **[4]** required by **[37 CFR 1.78](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//aia_d0e320662.html)**  is missing. Accordingly, applicant must supply 1) the missing **[5]** in provisional application No. **[6]** and 2) in the present application, a confirmation that the translation and statement were filed in the provisional application. If 1) and 2) are not filed (or if the benefit claim is not withdrawn) prior to the expiration of the time period set in this Office action, the present application will be abandoned. See **[37 CFR 1.78](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=200.html#//aia_d0e320662.html)**.

### Examiner Note:

1. Use this form paragraph to notify applicant that an English translation of the non-English language provisional application and/or a statement that the translation is accurate is required. Do not use this form paragraph if a translation of the provisional application and a statement that the translation was accurate were filed in the nonprovisional application (the present application) before November 25, 2005.

2. In brackets 1 and 3, insert the application number of the non-English language provisional application.
