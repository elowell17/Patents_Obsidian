# ¶ 12.239    Reopening of Prosecution After Appeal Brief

In view of the **[1]** filed on **[2]**, PROSECUTION IS HEREBY REOPENED. **[3]** set forth below.

To avoid abandonment of the application, appellant must exercise one of the following two options:

(1) file a reply under **[37 CFR 1.111](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1200.html#//d0e322449.html)**  (if this Office action is non-final) or a reply under **[37 CFR 1.113](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1200.html#//d0e322575.html)**  (if this Office action is final); or,

(2) initiate a new appeal by filing a notice of appeal under **[37 CFR 41.31](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1200.html#//d0e356411.html)**  followed by an appeal brief under **[37 CFR 41.37](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1200.html#//d0e356598.html)**.

If, however, the appeal fees set forth in **[37 CFR 41.20](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1200.html#//d0e356279.html)**  have been increased since they were previously paid, then appellant must pay the difference between the increased fees and the amount previously paid.

# ¶ 12.278    Warning in Examiner's Answer containing NSDP rejection not argued

This appeal includes a rejection of claims **[1]** which are rejected on the ground of non-statutory double patenting. This rejection was not addressed in the appellant's appeal brief. Should the Board either summarily affirm or not reach the rejection and the appellant should fail to overcome the rejection with a properly filed terminal disclaimer prior to seeking judicial review either by an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (**[35 U.S.C. 141](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1200.html#//d0e303314912.html)** ) or by civil action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia (**[35 U.S.C. 145](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1200.html#//d0e303379313.html)** ) the appeal may be dismissed by the Court for lack of jurisdiction because the claims on appeal are subject to the non-statutory double patenting rejection. Alternatively, the Court may summarily affirm the non-statutory double patenting rejection without considering other grounds of rejection challenged on the appeal.

### Examiner Note:

1. For use when claims are subject to the non-statutory double patenting rejection that has not been argued in the appeal brief.

2. In bracket 1, insert the claim numbers of the claims subject to the non-statutory double patenting rejection.

# ¶ 12.279.01    Conclusion to Examiner’s Answer Raising New Grounds of Rejection

For the above reasons, it is believed that the rejections should be sustained.

This examiner’s answer contains a new ground of rejection set forth in section **_(1)_** above. Accordingly, appellant must within **TWO MONTHS** from the date of this answer exercise one of the following two options to avoid sua sponte dismissal of the appeal as to the claims subject to the new ground of rejection:

(1) **Reopen prosecution**. Request that prosecution be reopened before the primary examiner by filing a reply under **[37 CFR 1.111](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1200.html#//d0e322449.html)**  with or without amendment, affidavit or other evidence. Any amendment, affidavit or other evidence must be relevant to the new grounds of rejection. A request that complies with **[37 CFR 41.39(b)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1200.html#//d0e356741.html##d0e356768)**  will be entered and considered. Any request that prosecution be reopened will be treated as a request to withdraw the appeal.

(2) **Maintain appeal**. Request that the appeal be maintained by filing a reply brief as set forth in **[37 CFR 41.41](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1200.html#//d0e356832.html)**. Such a reply brief must address each new ground of rejection as set forth in **[37 CFR 41.37(c)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1200.html#//d0e356598.html##d0e356626)**  and should be in compliance with the other requirements of **[37 CFR 41.37(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1200.html#//d0e356598.html##d0e356625)**. If a reply brief filed pursuant to **[37 CFR 41.39(b)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1200.html#//d0e356741.html##d0e356789)**  is accompanied by any amendment, affidavit or other evidence, it shall be treated as a request that prosecution be reopened before the primary examiner under **[37 CFR 41.39(b)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1200.html#//d0e356741.html##d0e356768)**.

See **[37 CFR 1.136(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1200.html#//d0e323655.html##d0e323744)**  for extensions of time to reply for patent applications and **[37 CFR 1.550(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1200.html#//d0e330470.html##d0e330510)**  for extensions of time to reply for _ex parte_ reexamination proceedings.
