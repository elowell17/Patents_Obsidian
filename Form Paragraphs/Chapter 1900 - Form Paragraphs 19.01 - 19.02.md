The failure to reply to this requirement for information within **TWO (2) MONTHS** of the mailing date of this requirement will result in abandonment of the application. This application has been granted special status under the accelerated examination program. Extensions of time under **[37 CFR 1.136(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1900.html#//d0e323655.html)**  are available. However, filing a petition for extension of time will result in the application being taken out of the accelerated examination program. In no case can any extension carry the date for reply to this letter beyond the maximum period of SIX MONTHS set by statute (**[35 U.S.C. 133](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=1900.html#//d0e303207aia.html)** ).

The objective of the accelerated examination program is to complete the examination of an application within twelve months from the filing date of the application. To meet that objective, any reply must be filed electronically via the USPTO patent electronic filing system so that the papers will be expeditiously processed and considered. If the reply is not filed electronically via the USPTO patent electronic filing system, the final disposition of the application may occur later than twelve months from the filing of the application.
