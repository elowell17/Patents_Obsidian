# ¶ 29.04    Statement of Statutory Bases, Improper Inventorship in International Design Application

Requirements applicable to design applications under 35 U.S.C. chapter 16 apply to international design applications except as otherwise provided under 35 U.S.C. chapter 38. See **[35 U.S.C. 382(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=2900.html#//al_d2259d_1b3fa_51.html##al_d225a2_1d8b7_32f)**, **[383](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=2900.html#//al_d225a2_27b3e_12d.html)**, and **[389(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=2900.html#//al_d225a2_27b90_d4.html##al_d225a2_29b65_5f)**.

**[35 U.S.C. 171(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=2900.html#//d0e304480.html##d0e304487pb)**  reads as follows:

(b) APPLICABILITY OF THIS TITLE.—The provisions of this title relating to patents for inventions shall apply to patents for designs, except as otherwise provided.

**[35 U.S.C. 115(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=2900.html#//d0e302875912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae82_81)**  reads as follows (in part):

An application for patent that is filed under section **[111(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=2900.html#//pltd0e302673aia.html##pltd0e302678aia)**  or commences the national stage under section **[371](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=2900.html#//d0e307164.html)**  shall include, or be amended to include, the name of the inventor for any invention claimed in the application.

The present application sets forth incorrect inventorship because **[1]**.

The claim is rejected under **[35 U.S.C. 171](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=2900.html#//d0e304480.html)**  and **[35 U.S.C. 115](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=2900.html#//d0e302875912.html)**  for failing to set forth the correct inventorship for the reasons stated above.

Applicant may correct inventorship pursuant to **[37 CFR 1.48(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=2900.html#//d0e317930.html##d0e317941)**  by submitting to the USPTO a properly signed and marked-up application data sheet (ADS) identifying each inventor by his or her legal name and accompanied by the required processing fee (**[37 CFR 1.17(i)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=2900.html#//eff_20130320_d0e315199.html##eff_20130320_d0e315546)** ). Any request to correct or change the inventorship under **[37 CFR 1.48(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=2900.html#//d0e317930.html##d0e317941)**  filed after the Office action on the merits has been given or mailed in the application must also be accompanied by the fee set forth in **[37 CFR 1.17(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=2900.html#//eff_20130320_d0e315199.html##eff_20130320_d0e315320)**. A corrected application data sheet in compliance with **[37 CFR 1.76(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=2900.html#//plt_d0e320348.html##aia_d0e320470)**  must identify the information that is being changed, with underlining for insertions, and strike-through or brackets for text removed. In addition, an oath or declaration as required by **[37 CFR 1.63](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=2900.html#//aia_d0e319759.html)**, or a substitute statement in compliance with **[37 CFR 1.64](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=2900.html#//aia_d0e319924.html)**, will be required for any actual inventor who has not yet executed such an oath or declaration. See **[37 CFR 1.48(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=2900.html#//d0e317930.html##d0e317988)**.

### Examiner Note:

In bracket 1, insert the basis for concluding that the inventorship is incorrect (e.g., "under U.S. national law, the inventor cannot be a juristic entity").

# ¶ 29.10    Reproductions Objected to, Amended Reproductions Do Not Comply With Formal Requirements

The amended reproductions received on **[1]** are objected to because **[2]**. See **[37 CFR 1.1026](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=2900.html#//ar_d22557_188bd_336.html)**.

### Examiner Note:

1. Use this form paragraph in an international design application to object to amended reproductions that fail to comply with the formal requirements for reproductions set forth in Rule 9 of the Common Regulations Under the 1999 Act and the 1960 Act of the Hague Agreement and Part Four of the Administrative Instructions thereunder. Do not use this form paragraph to object to reproductions that were contained in the international registration published by the International Bureau.

2. In bracket 1, insert the date the amended reproductions were received.

3. In bracket 2, insert the reason for the objection, for example, --the reproductions are not of a quality permitting all the details of the industrial design to be clearly distinguished-- or --the reproductions contain explanatory text or legends--.

4. Follow this form paragraph with form paragraph **[15.05.04](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=2900.html#//fp15.05.04.html)**.

# ¶ 29.11    Reproductions Objected to, Design Not Fully Disclosed in Reproductions

The reproductions are objected to for failing to fully disclose the industrial design because **[1]**. See **[37 CFR 1.1026](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=2900.html#//ar_d22557_188bd_336.html)**  and Rule 9 of the Common Regulations Under the 1999 Act and the 1960 Act of the Hague Agreement.

### Examiner Note:

1. Use this form paragraph in an international design application where the reproductions are not sufficient to fully disclose the industrial design, but such failure does not render the claimed invention non-enabled and/or indefinite under **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=2900.html#//d0e302824912.html)**. This may occur, for example, where there are minor inconsistencies in the illustration of the design among the different views of the design. Where the failure to fully disclose the industrial design in the reproductions renders the claimed invention non-enabled and/or indefinite under **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=2900.html#//d0e302824912.html)**, use form paragraph **[15.21](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=2900.html#//fp15.21.html)** or **[15.22](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=2900.html#//fp15.22.html)**, as appropriate, instead of this form paragraph.

2. In bracket 1, explain why the reproductions are not sufficient to fully disclose the industrial design.

3. Follow this form paragraph with form paragraph **[15.05.04](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=2900.html#//fp15.05.04.html)**.

# ¶ 29.20    Matter Not Forming Part of Design (International Design Application)

Matter, such as environmental structure or portions of the "article," which is shown in a reproduction but for which protection is not sought may be indicated by statement in the description and/or by means of dotted or broken lines or coloring in the reproduction. See **[37 CFR 1.1026](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=2900.html#//ar_d22557_188bd_336.html)**  and Hague Agreement Administrative Instruction 403.

### Examiner Note:

Use this form paragraph only in an international design application.

# ¶ 29.21    Rejection, 35 U.S.C. 112(b) - Undescribed Broken Lines (International Design Application)

The claim is rejected for failing to particularly point out and distinctly claim the invention as required in **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=2900.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)**. The claim is indefinite because the reproductions include, in figure(s) **[1]**, broken lines that are not described in the specification, and the scope of the claimed design cannot be determined.

If the broken line(s) represent portions of the article or environmental structure for which protection is not sought, applicant may overcome this rejection by inserting a statement similar to the following into the specification immediately preceding the claim, provided such statement does not introduce new matter (see **[35 U.S.C. 132](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=2900.html#//d0e303187.html)** ):

See **[MPEP § 713](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=2900.html#//d0e84376.html)**. The examiner will not discuss the merits of the application with applicant's representative if the representative is not registered to practice before the USPTO. Appointment as applicant’s representative before the International Bureau pursuant to Rule 3 of the Common Regulations under the Hague Agreement does **NOT** entitle such representative to represent the applicant before the USPTO. Furthermore, an applicant that is a juristic entity **must** be represented by a patent attorney or agent registered to practice before the USPTO. Additional information regarding interviews is set forth below.

**Telephonic or in person interviews**

A telephonic or in person interview may only be conducted with an attorney or agent registered to practice before the USPTO ("registered practitioner") or with a _pro se_ applicant (an applicant who is the inventor and who is not represented by a registered practitioner).

The registered practitioner may either be of record or not of record. To become "of record," a power of attorney (POA) in accordance with **[37 CFR 1.32](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=2900.html#//aia_d0e317381.html)**  must be filed in the application. Form PTO/AIA/80 "Power of Attorney to Prosecute Applications Before the USPTO," available at **[www.uspto.gov/ patent/forms/forms-patent-applications-filed-or-after-september-16-2012](https://www.uspto.gov/patent/forms/forms-patent-applications-filed-or-after-september-16-2012)**, may be used for this purpose. See **[MPEP § 402.02(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=2900.html#//ch400_d1fe3a_237c2_34b.html)** for further information. Interviews may also be conducted with a registered practitioner not of record provided the registered practitioner can show authorization to conduct an interview by completing, signing and filing an "Applicant Initiated Interview Request Form" (PTOL-413A) (available at the USPTO web page indicated above). See **[MPEP § 405](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=2900.html#//d0e22262.html)**. For acceptable ways to submit forms to the USPTO, see "When Responding to Official USPTO Correspondence" below.

### Examiner Note:

Add this paragraph at the end of the Refusal where a patent attorney or agent registered to practice before the United States Patent and Trademark Office has not been appointed as applicant's representative.

# ¶ 29.102    Reply Reminder for Restriction Requirements Concerning Figure Numbering

In replying to this Refusal electing a Group for prosecution, applicant should also consider amending the application to cancel the drawing figures and remove the description corresponding to the nonelected Group(s), and to correct inventorship, as appropriate, resulting from such amendment pursuant to **[37 CFR 1.48](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=2900.html#//d0e317930.html)**. See **[MPEP § 602.01(c)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=2900.html#//ch600_d2002c_231e9_20c.html)**. Applicant should note that correcting inventorship after an Office action on the merits has been given or mailed in the application will require an additional fee pursuant to **[37 CFR 1.48(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=2900.html#//d0e317930.html##d0e318008)**.

Renumbering of the drawing figures is not required. To maintain consistency with the published International Registration, it is recommended that the numbering of the drawing figures included in the elected Group not be changed even if non-elected embodiments are cancelled. Any amendment to the drawing figures should comply with **[37 CFR 1.1026](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=2900.html#//ar_d22557_188bd_336.html)**  and Part Four of the Administrative Instructions (in particular, see Section 405 of the Administrative Instructions with respect to numbering of reproductions).

### Examiner Note:

Add this paragraph at the end of a restriction requirement in a nonprovisional international design application. If there is no patent practitioner of record, also include form paragraph **[29.100](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=2900.html#//fp29.100.html)** Reply Reminder.
