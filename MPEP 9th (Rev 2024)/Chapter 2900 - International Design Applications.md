# 2901    Basic Hague Agreement Principles [R-07.2022]

## I.    **OVERVIEW**

The Geneva Act of the Hague Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Industrial Designs, July 2, 1999 (hereinafter "Hague Agreement") is an international agreement that enables an applicant to file a single international design application which may have the effect of an application for protection for the design(s) in countries and/or intergovernmental organizations that are parties to the Hague Agreement (the "Contracting Parties") designated in the application. The United States is a Contracting Party to the Hague Agreement, which took effect with respect to the United States on May 13, 2015. The Hague Agreement is administered by the International Bureau of the World Intellectual Property Organization ("the International Bureau").

## II.    **BASIC FLOW UNDER THE HAGUE AGREEMENT**

## A.    _**Filing**_

An international design application may be filed by an applicant "indirectly" through the office of the applicant’s Contracting Party (provided such Contracting Party has not declared that international design applications may not be filed through its office) or "directly" with the International Bureau. To be entitled to file an international design application, the applicant must be a national of a State that is a Contracting Party or of a State member of an intergovernmental organization that is a Contracting Party, or have a domicile, habitual residence, or a real and effective industrial or commercial establishment in the territory of a Contracting Party.

The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO") is an office of indirect filing. Only persons who are nationals of the United States or who have a domicile, habitual residence, or a real and effective industrial or commercial establishment in the territory of the United States may file international design applications through the USPTO. If the application is filed through the USPTO, the Office will confirm that the required transmittal fee has been paid, perform a security review, and check that the required indications demonstrating applicant’s entitlement to file the application through the USPTO are present in the application submission. If the transmittal fee is paid and the application clears security review and contains the indications establishing applicant’s entitlement to file the application through the USPTO, the application will be transmitted to the International Bureau and the applicant will be notified of the transmittal. The USPTO will also notify the applicant and the International Bureau of the receipt date of the application.

## B.    _**Formal Examination by the International Bureau; International Registration**_

Regardless of whether the application is filed indirectly through applicant's Contracting Party or directly with the International Bureau, the International Bureau examines the application to determine whether the applicable formal requirements under the Hague Agreement and Common Regulations Under the 1999 Act and the 1960 Act of the Hague Agreement have been satisfied. If the applicable requirements have been satisfied, the International Bureau will accord the application a filing date and an international registration date and register the industrial design in the International Register. The international registration includes all the data contained in the international design application (including any priority claim where the earlier filing is not more than six months prior to the international filing date), the reproduction(s) of the design, the international registration number and international registration date, and the class of the International Classification determined by the International Bureau. The International Bureau also sends a certificate of international registration to the applicant. Upon registration, the applicant is thereafter referred to as the "holder" of the international registration.

If the International Bureau finds that the international design application does not satisfy the applicable requirements, it will invite the applicant to make the required corrections within a prescribed time limit. The failure to timely respond to the invitation may result in abandonment of the application or removal of the designation of a Contracting Party pursuant to Hague Agreement Article 8.

## C.    _**Publication**_

International registrations are published by the International Bureau. However, applicants may control the timing of publication to some extent. Specifically, the applicant may request in the official application form that publication occur immediately after international registration or that publication be deferred for up to 30 months from the filing date (or priority date, if applicable). Deferment of publication is not possible if a Contracting Party is designated that does not permit deferred publication. For applications filed on or after January 1, 2022, absent a request for immediate publication or deferment, the registration will be published twelve months after the date of international registration, or as soon as possible thereafter. For applications filed before January 1, 2022, absent a request for immediate publication or deferment, the registration will be published six months after the date of international registration, or as soon as possible thereafter. The publication includes the data recorded in the International Register and the reproductions(s) of the industrial design.

A copy of the publication of the international registration is communicated by the International Bureau to the office of each designated Contracting Party. If the United States is designated, the U.S. application assigned to the international registration will be made available in Patent Center shortly after publication of the international registration by the International Bureau. The U.S. application can be found in Patent Center by searching using the international registration number.

For certain Contracting Parties, the date of publication of the international registration may trigger a time period in which to furnish certain submissions required under the law of the Contracting Party concerned, such as priority documents. The International Bureau’s Hague Member Profiles database available at **[www.wipo.int/hague/memberprofiles/#/](https://www.wipo.int/hague/memberprofiles/#/)**  provides information regarding requirements concerning designated Contracting Parties.

## D.    _**Examination by the Offices of the Designated Contracting Parties**_

Following publication of the international registration by the International Bureau, the offices of the designated Contracting Parties proceed with substantive examination if required under their respective laws. Some Contracting Parties do not carry out substantive examination. Furthermore, some Contracting Parties that carry out substantive examination only do so on limited grounds. The International Bureau’s Hague Member Profiles database available at **[www.wipo.int/hague/ memberprofiles/#/](https://www.wipo.int/hague/memberprofiles/#/)**  provides detailed information regarding the scope of substantive examination carried out by designated Contracting Parties.

As a result of that examination, the office may notify the International Bureau of a refusal of protection for its territory. A refusal of protection, if any, must be notified to the International Bureau within six months from the date of publication of the international registration. However, any Contracting Party whose office is an examining office, or whose law provides for the possibility of opposition to the grant of protection, may declare that the refusal period of six months is extended to 12 months.

The notification of refusal is communicated by the office of the designated Contracting Party concerned to the International Bureau, which then transmits a copy of the notification of refusal to the holder. Any reply to the notification of refusal must be communicated directly to the designated Contracting Party concerned and not through the International Bureau. After communication of the notification of refusal, all further communications between the applicant and the designated office are directly between them and do not involve the International Bureau.

Pursuant to **[35 U.S.C. 389](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//al_d225a2_27b90_d4.html)**, the USPTO will examine international design applications designating the United States based on the published international registration received from the International Bureau. Where it appears that the applicant is not entitled to a patent under the law of the United States with respect to any industrial design that is the subject of the international registration, the Office will send a notification of refusal to the International Bureau, normally within 12 months from the publication of the international registration. The applicant may reply to such notification directly to the USPTO. Any further Office action, such as a subsequent non-final rejection, a final rejection, or an allowance, will be sent directly to the applicant.

## E.    **_Effect as a Grant of Protection_**

Hague Agreement Article 14(2) provides that the international registration shall have the same effect as a grant of protection for the industrial design under the law of that Contracting Party at the latest from the date of expiration of the period allowed for it to communicate a refusal or, where a Contracting Party has made a corresponding declaration under the Regulations, at the latest at the time specified in that declaration. Article 14(2) further provides, that where the office of a designated Contracting Party has communicated a refusal and has subsequently withdrawn, in part or in whole, that refusal, the international registration shall, to the extent that the refusal is withdrawn, have the same effect in that Contracting Party as a grant of protection for the industrial design under the law of the Contracting Party at the latest from the date on which the refusal was withdrawn.

Contracting Parties vary as to when protection begins within their territories, the duration of protection, and notification of protection. For some Contracting Parties, the effect of a grant of protection begins on the international registration date; for others, the protection may begin on the publication date or later date. Information regarding when protection begins in designated Contracting Parties may be found in the International Bureau’s Hague Member Profiles database available at **[www.wipo.int/hague/ memberprofiles/#/](https://www.wipo.int/hague/memberprofiles/#/)**.

The duration of protection available also varies among Contracting Parties. Under the Hague Agreement, Contracting Parties must provide a minimum period of protection of 15 years counted from the international registration date, provided the international registration is renewed. Many Contracting Parties provide for longer periods of protection. For a complete listing of the maximum duration of protection available before Contracting Parties, see **[www.wipo.int/hague/en/declarations/](https://www.wipo.int/hague/en/declarations/)**. For most Contracting Parties, renewal of the international registration, including payment of a renewal fee, is required at five-year increments to maintain protection.

While many designated Contracting Parties send notification when protection has been granted within their territories, typically through issuance of a Statement of Grant of Protection communicated to the International Bureau pursuant to the provisions of Hague Agreement Rule 18_bis,_ the sending of such a notification is not required under certain circumstances. Thus, some Contracting Parties may not send any notification that protection has begun within their territories.

For international design applications designating the United States, protection begins upon the date of issuance of a U.S. design patent from such application and extends to those industrial designs that are the subject of the international registration and covered by the U.S. design patent. Concurrent with the issuance of the patent, the USPTO communicates a Statement of Grant of protection to the International Bureau.

# 2904    Who May File An International Design Application [R-07.2015]

#### _Hague Article 3_

#### _Entitlement to File an International Application_

Any person that is a national of a State that is a Contracting Party or of a State member of an intergovernmental organization that is a Contracting Party, or that has a domicile, a habitual residence or a real and effective industrial or commercial establishment in the territory of a Contracting Party, shall be entitled to file an international application.

Pursuant to Article 3 of the Hague Agreement, to be entitled to file an international design application, a person must: (1) be a national of a Contracting Party or of a State that is a member of an intergovernmental organization that is a Contracting Party; or (2) have a domicile, habitual residence, or real and effective industrial or commercial establishment in the territory of a Contracting Party.

Article 1(ix) of the Hague Agreement defines a "person" as a natural person or a legal entity, and Article 1(xiii) defines a "Contracting Party" as a State or intergovernmental organization that is a party to the Hague Agreement.

A list of the Contracting Parties to the Hague Agreement is maintained on the website of the World Intellectual Property Organization (**[www.wipo.int/ hague/en/members/](http://www.wipo.int/hague/en/members/)** ).

# 2905    Where to File An International Design Application [R-01.2024]

#### _Hague Article 4_

#### _Procedure for Filing the International Application_

- (1) [_Direct or Indirect Filing_]
    - (a) The international application may be filed, at the option of the applicant, either directly with the International Bureau or through the Office of the applicant's Contracting Party.
    - (b) Notwithstanding subparagraph (a), any Contracting Party may, in a declaration, notify the Director General that international applications may not be filed through its Office.
- (2) [_Transmittal Fee in Case of Indirect Filing_] The Office of any Contracting Party may require that the applicant pay a transmittal fee to it, for its own benefit, in respect of any international application filed through it.

Pursuant to Article 4 of the Hague Agreement, an international design application may be filed either directly with the International Bureau or indirectly through the office of the applicant’s Contracting Party. However, Contracting Parties may notify the International Bureau that applications may not be filed indirectly through their office. See Article 4(1)(b). As such, only certain offices may allow for "indirect" filing. The WIPO website provides information on which Contracting Parties permit "indirect" filing through their office. See **[www.wipo.int/hague/en/declarations/](https://www.wipo.int/hague/en/declarations/)**.

Article 1(xiv) of the Hague Agreement defines the "applicant’s Contracting Party" as the Contracting Party from which the applicant derives its entitlement to file an international design application under Hague Agreement Article 3 or, if there is more than one such Contracting Party, the one Contracting Party among those Contracting Parties that the applicant expressly identifies as the "applicant’s Contracting Party" in the international design application.

If the applicant is a national of the United States, or has a domicile, a habitual residence, or a real and effective industrial or commercial establishment in the United States, the international design application may be filed directly with the International Bureau, provided any required foreign filing license has been obtained, or indirectly through the USPTO. See **[MPEP § 2905.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ch2900_d24abb_1b428_e1.html)** regarding filing indirectly through the USPTO. Filing the international design application directly with the International Bureau through the WIPO’s e-filing interface (eHague) offers several benefits to applicants, including allowing for direct entry of application data via the interface, thus eliminating the need to upload a separate application (DM/1) form; validation of the entered data in real time to minimize errors in the application submission; automatic calculation of fees due and determination of appropriate annexes; quicker examination by the International Bureau, which may be important for applicants desiring immediate publication or a certified copy of the international design application for priority purposes quickly; allowing applicants to use eHague to reply to subsequent WIPO communications concerning that application when applicant has used eHague to file the international design application; avoidance of the transmittal fee required by the USPTO for indirectly filed applications; and allowing for reuse of data from previous applications. For further information regarding eHague, see WIPO’s website at **[https://hague.wipo.int/](https://hague.wipo.int/)**.

# 2905.01    Filing Through the USPTO as an Office of Indirect Filing [R-01.2024]

#### _35 U.S.C. 382  Filing international design applications._

- (a) IN GENERAL.—Any person who is a national of the United States, or has a domicile, a habitual residence, or a real and effective industrial or commercial establishment in the United States, may file an international design application by submitting to the Patent and Trademark Office an application in such form, together with such fees, as may be prescribed by the Director.
- (b) REQUIRED ACTION.—The Patent and Trademark Office shall perform all acts connected with the discharge of its duties under the treaty, including the collection of international fees and transmittal thereof to the International Bureau. Subject to chapter 17, international design applications shall be forwarded by the Patent and Trademark Office to the International Bureau, upon payment of a transmittal fee.
- (c) APPLICABILITY OF CHAPTER 16.—Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the provisions of chapter 16 shall apply.
- (d) APPLICATION FILED IN ANOTHER COUNTRY.—An international design application on an industrial design made in this country shall be considered to constitute the filing of an application in a foreign country within the meaning of chapter 17 if the international design application is filed—
    - (1) in a country other than the United States;
    - (2) at the International Bureau; or
    - (3) with an intergovernmental organization.

#### _37 C.F.R. 1.1002  The United States Patent and Trademark Office as an office of indirect filing._

- (a) The United States Patent and Trademark Office, as an office of indirect filing, shall accept international design applications where the applicant’s Contracting Party is the United States.
- (b) The major functions of the United States Patent and Trademark Office as an office of indirect filing include:
    - (1) Receiving and according a receipt date to international design applications;
    - (2) Collecting and, when required, transmitting fees due for processing international design applications;
    - (3) Determining compliance with applicable requirements of part 5 of this chapter; and
    - (4) Transmitting an international design application to the International Bureau, unless prescriptions concerning national security prevent the application from being transmitted.

#### _37 C.F.R. 1.1011  Applicant for international design application._

- (a) Only persons who are nationals of the United States or who have a domicile, a habitual residence, or a real and effective industrial or commercial establishment in the territory of the United States may file international design applications through the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
- (b) Although the United States Patent and Trademark Office will accept international design applications filed by any person referred to in paragraph (a) of this section, an international design application designating the United States may be refused by the Office as a designated office if the applicant is not a person qualified under 35 U.S.C. chapter 11 to be an applicant.

#### _37 C.F.R. 1.1012  Applicant’s Contracting Party._

In order to file an international design application through the United States Patent and Trademark Office as an office of indirect filing, the United States must be applicant’s Contracting Party (Articles 4 and 1(xiv)).

#### _37 C.F.R. 1.1045  Procedures for transmittal of international design application to the International Bureau._

- (a) Subject to paragraph (b) of this section and payment of the transmittal fee set forth in § **[1.1031(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d22557_1eb2e_2ea.html##ar_d22557_1eb7c_34c)**, transmittal of the international design application to the International Bureau shall be made by the Office as provided by Rule 13(1). At the same time as it transmits the international design application to the International Bureau, the Office shall notify the International Bureau of the date on which it received the application. The Office shall also notify the applicant of the date on which it received the application and of the transmittal of the international design application to the International Bureau.
- (b) No copy of an international design application may be transmitted to the International Bureau, a foreign designated office, or other foreign authority by the Office or the applicant, unless the applicable requirements of part 5 of this chapter have been satisfied.
- (c) Once transmittal of the international design application has been effected under paragraph (a) of this section, except for matters properly before the United States Patent and Trademark Office as an office of indirect filing or as a designated office, all further correspondence concerning the application should be sent directly to the International Bureau. The United States Patent and Trademark Office will generally not forward communications to the International Bureau received after transmittal of the application to the International Bureau. Any reply to an invitation sent to the applicant by the International Bureau must be filed directly with the International Bureau, and not with the Office, to avoid abandonment or other loss of rights under Article 8.

Only persons who are nationals of the United States or who have a domicile, a habitual residence, or a real and effective industrial or commercial establishment in the United States may file international design applications through the USPTO. See **[35 U.S.C. 382(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//al_d2259d_1b3fa_51.html##al_d225a2_1d7ab_78)**  and **[37 CFR 1.1011(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d22557_165df_c8.html##ar_d22557_1664f_b7)**. In addition, in order to file an international design application through the USPTO, the United States must be applicant’s Contracting Party. See **[37 CFR 1.1012](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d22557_166fd_29c.html)**  and Hague Agreement Article 4. Thus, an international design application may be filed through the USPTO only if: (1) the applicant, or each applicant if there is more than one applicant, is a national of the United States or has a domicile, a habitual residence, or a real and effective industrial or commercial establishment in the United States; and (2) the United States is the applicant’s Contracting Party, or each applicant’s Contracting Party if there is more than one applicant.

The official form for presenting the international design application, "Application for International Registration" (form DM/1), includes boxes to indicate both applicant’s entitlement to file the international design application and applicant’s Contracting Party. See **[MPEP § 2909.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ch2900_d24abc_168f1_8d.html)**.

International design applications may be filed through the USPTO as an office of indirect filing via the USPTO patent electronic filing system, mail, or hand-delivery to the Customer Service Window at the USPTO’s Alexandria headquarters. See **[MPEP § 501](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e24257.html)**, subsection III for information regarding hand-delivery of papers.

In addition, international design applications filed with the USPTO are subject to national security review. See **[35 U.S.C. 382(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//al_d2259d_1b3fa_51.html##al_d225a2_1d859_1b5)**. The international design application will not be transmitted to the International Bureau if the transmittal fee has not been paid or the necessary national security clearance has not been obtained. See **[37 CFR 1.1045](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d22557_1ff22_2ad.html)**.

Upon receipt of an international design application, the USPTO will review the application for the required indications establishing each applicant’s entitlement to file the international design application through the USPTO, payment of the transmittal fee, and national security. If the indications are not sufficient to establish each applicant’s entitlement to file the international design application through the USPTO, the transmittal fee has not been paid, or the necessary national security clearance has not been obtained, the Office will notify the applicant accordingly via Form PTO-2320, "Notification Regarding Receipt And Transmittal Of The International Design Application To The International Bureau." Form PTO-2320 does not set a time period to cure the deficiency but instead warns the applicant that an international design application that is not received by the International Bureau within six months from receipt of the application by the USPTO will receive a filing date as of the date on which the International Bureau receives the application, rather than the USPTO receipt date, subject to Hague Agreement Rule 14(2).

If the conditions for transmitting the international design application to the International Bureau have been satisfied, the application will be transmitted to the International Bureau. The applicant will be notified via Form PTO-2320 of the transmittal of the application to the International Bureau and of the receipt date of the international design application by the USPTO.

Because the international design application must be received by the International Bureau within six months of receipt of the application by the USPTO in order to obtain the receipt date at the USPTO as the filing date, the applicant should contact the USPTO for a status update well in advance of the expiration of this six month period if the applicant has not received Form PTO-2320 indicating transmittal of the application to the International Bureau.

Applicants are reminded, when electronically filing an international design application through the USPTO as an office of indirect filing, to attach reproductions via the "Reproductions" section of the "Upload documents" screen of the USPTO patent electronic filing system rather than via the "Upload documents" section of the "Upload documents" screen. Failure to attach the reproductions via the "Reproductions" section may result in additional per page publication fees being required by the International Bureau.

The Office will generally not forward any submission filed in an international design application to the International Bureau that is received after the application has been transmitted to the International Bureau. Applicants are cautioned that any reply to an invitation sent to the applicant by the International Bureau must be filed directly with the International Bureau, and not with the Office, to avoid abandonment or other loss of rights under Hague Agreement Article 8. See **[37 CFR 1.1045(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d22557_1ff22_2ad.html##ar_d22557_20097_37)**.

*****

The filing date of an international design application is accorded by the International Bureau pursuant to Article 9 and Rules 14(2) and 13(3) of the Hague Agreement. The filing date of an international design application in the United States is not necessarily the same date as the filing date accorded by the International Bureau. See **[MPEP § 2908](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ch2900_d24abb_26063_251.html)**. The filing date accorded by the International Bureau is referred to as the international filing date.

Pursuant to Rule 14(2), the International Bureau will accord the international design application a filing date only if the application is in one of the prescribed languages. The prescribed languages, set forth in Hague Agreement Rule 6, are English, French, and Spanish. In addition, the international design application must include:

- (1) an indication that international registration under the Hague Agreement is requested;
- (2) a sufficient indication of the applicant’s identity;
- (3) a sufficient indication to allow the applicant or its representative to be contacted;
- (4) a reproduction or specimen of each industrial design that is the subject of the application; and
- (5) the designation of at least one Contracting Party.

If the international design application does not fulfill the applicable requirements, the International Bureau will invite the applicant to make the required corrections within a prescribed time limit. See Rule 14(1)(a) and (b). If the defect concerns a missing element required under Rule 14(2) and the applicant timely provides the missing element required under Rule 14(2), the date on which the missing element is received by the International Bureau will be the filing date accorded by the International Bureau. Where the defect, other than a defect referred to in Article 8(2)(b), is not timely remedied, the international design application shall be considered abandoned. Failure to timely remedy a defect referred to in Article 8(2)(b) will result in the international design application being deemed not to contain the designation of the Contracting Party concerned. See **[MPEP § 2907](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ch2900_d24abb_2367e_146.html)**.

With respect to an international design application filed indirectly through the office of a Contracting Party that is governed exclusively by the 1999 Geneva Act, the international filing date will be the date the international design application was received in the office of the Contracting Party, subject to Rule 14(2), and provided that the application is received by the International Bureau within the time period specified in Rule 13(3). The time period specified in Rule 13(3) is one month from the date of receipt of the application by the Contracting Party or six months from the date of receipt where the Contracting Party has notified the International Bureau that it requires security clearance before communicating the application. The United States has notified the International Bureau that it requires a security clearance.

#### _Hague Article 10_

#### _International Registration, Date of the International Registration, Publication and Confidential Copies of the International Registration_

- (1) [_International Registration_] The International Bureau shall register each industrial design that is the subject of an international application immediately upon receipt by it of the international application or, where corrections are invited under Article 8, immediately upon receipt of the required corrections. The registration shall be effected whether or not publication is deferred under Article 11.
- (2) [_Date of the International Registration_]
    - (a) Subject to subparagraph (b), the date of the international registration shall be the filing date of the international application.

#### _Contents of the International Application_

*****

- (2) [_Additional Mandatory Contents of the International Application_]
    - (a) Any Contracting Party whose Office is an Examining Office and whose law, at the time it becomes party to this Act, requires that an application for the grant of protection to an industrial design contain any of the elements specified in subparagraph (b) in order for that application to be accorded a filing date under that law may, in a declaration, notify the Director General of those elements.
    - (b) The elements that may be notified pursuant to subparagraph (a) are the following:
        - (i) indications concerning the identity of the creator of the industrial design that is the subject of that application;
        - (ii) a brief description of the reproduction or of the characteristic features of the industrial design that is the subject of that application;
        - (iii) a claim.
    - (c) Where the international application contains the designation of a Contracting Party that has made a notification under subparagraph (a), it shall also contain, in the prescribed manner, any element that was the subject of that notification.

*****

If the International Bureau determines that the international design application conforms to the applicable requirements, it will register the industrial design in the International Register. See Article 10(1) and Rule 15. Pursuant to Article 10(2), the date of international registration will be the international filing date (see **[MPEP § 2906](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ch2900_d24abb_21316_3b.html)**) unless there is an applicable requirement under Hague Agreement Article 5(2) that has not been satisfied, in which case the date of international registration will be the date that a timely correction satisfying the outstanding requirement(s) of Article 5(2) is received, or the international filing date, whichever is later.

Hague Agreement Article 5(2) sets forth additional mandatory elements of an international design application that may be required by certain Contracting Parties. Where the international design application contains the designation of a Contracting Party that has notified the International Bureau that it requires an element under Article 5(2), then the international design application must contain that element. The additional elements that may be required under Article 5(2) are: (1) an indication identifying the creator of the industrial design; (2) a brief description of the reproduction or of the characteristic features of the industrial design; and (3) a claim.

If the international design application does not comply with the applicable requirements, including any missing element required under Article 5(2), the International Bureau will invite the applicant to remedy the defect within a prescribed time limit. See Rule 14(1)(a) and (b). Where the defect relates to a missing requirement under Article 5(2), or to a special requirement notified to the International Bureau in accordance with the Regulations under the Hague Agreement (e.g., the requirement for an oath or declaration of the creator pursuant to Rule 8), the failure to timely comply with the invitation will result in the international design application being deemed not to contain the designation of the Contracting Party concerned. See Article 8(2)(b).

The elements of an international design application fall into three categories: (1) mandatory contents; (2) additional mandatory contents; and (3) optional contents.

## I.    **MANDATORY CONTENTS**

Mandatory contents are those items required in all international design applications. Such contents are set forth in Article 5(1) and Rule 7 of the Hague Agreement and **[37 CFR 1.1021(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d22557_1676c_6e.html##ar_d22557_16790_1a)**. Specifically, the international design application must be in English, French, or Spanish, it must be presented on the official form (see **[MPEP § 2909.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ch2900_d24abc_168f1_8d.html)**) and signed by the applicant, and it must include: (1) a request for international registration under the Hague Agreement; (2) the prescribed data concerning the applicant; (3) the prescribed number of copies of a reproduction or, at the choice of the applicant, of several different reproductions of the industrial design that is the subject of the international design application, presented in the prescribed manner (where the industrial design is two-dimensional and a request for deferment of publication is made in accordance with Article 5(5) of the Hague Agreement, the international design application may, instead of containing reproductions, be accompanied by the prescribed number of specimens of the industrial design); (4) an indication of the product or products that constitute the industrial design or in relation to which the industrial design is to be used, as prescribed; (5) an indication of the designated Contracting Parties; (6) the prescribed fees; (7) the Contracting Party or Parties in respect of which the applicant fulfills the conditions to be the holder of an international registration; (8) the number of industrial designs included in the international application, which may not exceed 100, and the number of reproductions or specimens of the industrial designs accompanying the international application; (9) the amount of the fees being paid and the method of payment or instructions to debit the required amount of fees to an account opened with the International Bureau and the identification of the party effecting the payment or giving the instructions; and (10) an indication of applicant’s Contracting Party as required under Rule 7(4)(a).

## II.    **ADDITIONAL MANDATORY CONTENTS**

Additional mandatory contents are elements that are required by certain Contracting Parties and therefore are mandatory in any international design application that designates such Contracting Parties (see Article 5(2) and Rule 7 of the Hague Agreement and **[37 CFR 1.1021(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d22557_1676c_6e.html##ar_d22557_1692b_352)** ). Such additional mandatory contents may consist of, pursuant to Article 5(2) of the Hague Agreement, indications concerning the identity of the creator, a brief description of the reproduction or of the characteristic features of the industrial design, and/or a claim, and, pursuant to Rule 8(1) of the Hague Agreement, a statement, document, oath, or declaration.

## III.    **OPTIONAL CONTENTS**

Optional contents are items that may be included in an international design application. Optional contents are addressed in Rule 7(5) of the Hague Agreement and **[37 CFR 1.1021(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d22557_1676c_6e.html##ar_d22557_171ef_ff)**  and may include: (1) two or more industrial designs, subject to the prescribed conditions; (2) a request for deferment of publication or a request for immediate publication; (3) any of the additional mandatory elements discussed above, even if such elements are not required by any Contracting Party designated in the international design application; (4) the prescribed information concerning the applicant’s representative; (5) a claim of priority of one or more earlier filed applications, which, pursuant to Administrative Instruction section 408(a), may be accompanied by an access code allowing to retrieve the priority document from a Digital Access Service for Priority Documents (DAS) digital library; (6) a declaration, for purposes of Article 11 of the Paris Convention, that the product or products that constitute the industrial design, or in which the industrial design is incorporated, have been shown at an official or officially recognized international exhibition, together with the place where the exhibition was held and the date on which the product or products were first exhibited there and, where less than all the industrial designs contained in the international application are concerned, the indication of those industrial designs to which the declaration relates or does not relate; (7) any declaration, statement, or other relevant indication as may be specified in the Administrative Instructions; (8) a statement that identifies information known by the applicant to be material to the eligibility for protection of the industrial design concerned; and (9) a proposed translation of any text matter contained in the international application for purposes of recording and publication.

## IV.    **REQUIRED CONTENTS WHERE THE UNITED STATES IS DESIGNATED**

As set forth in **[37 CFR 1.1021(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d22557_1676c_6e.html##ar_d22557_173f5_320)**, in addition to the mandatory requirements otherwise required for international design applications, an international design application designating the United States must also include: (1) a claim (**[37 CFR 1.1021(b)(1)(iii)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d22557_1676c_6e.html##ar_d22557_169c6_31f)**  and **[37 CFR 1.1025](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d22557_1885d_aa.html)** ); (2) indications concerning the identity of the creator (i.e., the inventor, see **[37 CFR 1.9(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//aia_d0e313866.html##aia_d0e313913)** ) in accordance with Rule 11(1); and (3) the inventor’s oath or declaration (**[37 CFR 1.63](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//aia_d0e319759.html)**  and **[1.64](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//aia_d0e319924.html)** ).

A claim is a filing date requirement for design applications in the United States. See **[35 U.S.C. 171](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e304480.html)**. The United States has declared, pursuant to Article 5(2), that an international design application designating the United States must contain a claim. See **[MPEP § 2903](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ch2900_d24abb_193ad_e2.html)**. Consequently, an international design application designating the United States that does not contain a claim will not be registered by the International Bureau in the international register and thus will not be entitled to a filing date in the United States. See **[MPEP §§ 2907](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ch2900_d24abb_2367e_146.html)** and **[2908](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ch2900_d24abb_26063_251.html)**. In such case, the International Bureau will invite the applicant to submit the claim within a prescribed time limit and will accord a date of international registration as of the date of receipt of the claim (assuming there are no other defects). Failure to timely submit the claim in response to the invitation by the International Bureau will result in the application being deemed not to contain the designation of the United States. See Article 8(2)(b). Use of the official application form (form DM/1) will help ensure that applicants designating the United States will satisfy the requirement for a claim, as Item (12) of the official form includes a claim for the purposes of the designation of the United States. See **[MPEP § 2909.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ch2900_d24abc_168f1_8d.html)**.

Pursuant to Rule 8(1), the United States has declared that an international design application designating the United States must contain an oath or declaration of the creator and indications concerning the identity of the creator. See **[MPEP § 2903](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ch2900_d24abb_193ad_e2.html)**. The requirements for the inventor’s oath or declaration are set forth in **[37 CFR 1.63](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//aia_d0e319759.html)**  and **[1.64](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//aia_d0e319924.html)**. **[37 CFR 1.1021(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d22557_1676c_6e.html##ar_d22557_173f5_320)**  further provides that the requirements in **[37 CFR 1.63(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//aia_d0e319759.html##aia_d0e319802)**  and **[1.64(b)(4)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//aia_d0e319924.html##ar_d1d8b5_20048_205)**  to identify each inventor by his or her legal name, mailing address, and residence, if an inventor lives at a location which is different from the mailing address, and the requirement in **[37 CFR 1.64(b)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//aia_d0e319924.html##ar_d1d8b5_1ffe0_80)**  to identify the residence and mailing address of the person signing the substitute statement will be considered satisfied by the presentation of such information in the international design application prior to international registration. If the inventor’s oath or declaration has not been filed, the International Bureau will invite the applicant to submit the inventor’s oath or declaration within a prescribed time limit. Failure to timely submit the inventor’s oath or declaration in response to the invitation by the International Bureau will result in the application being deemed not to contain the designation of the United States. See Article 8(2)(b). Annex I to the official application form (form DM/1) available at **[www.wipo.int/hague/en/forms/](https://www.wipo.int/hague/en/forms/)**  includes a declaration of inventorship form and a substitute statement form for use with international design applications designating the United States. See **[MPEP § 2909.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ch2900_d24abc_18773_1f.html)**.

An international design application designating the United States must include a specification as prescribed by **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e302824912.html)**  and preferably include a brief description of the reproductions pursuant to Rule 7(5)(a) describing the view or views of the reproductions. See **[37 CFR 1.1024](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d22557_18801_333.html)**. The Office encourages applicants filing international design applications that designate the United States to include a brief description in the application describing the views of the reproductions, as such description is helpful for examination and may, in some cases, help avoid issues concerning the scope of the claimed design or sufficiency of disclosure. Furthermore, a description of the view or views of the reproductions may be required by the Office in a nonprovisional international design application, as defined by **[37 CFR 1.9(a)(3)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//aia_d0e313866.html##aia_d0e313892)**, pursuant to **[37 CFR 1.1067](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d22557_20f6a_11c.html)**. See **[MPEP § 2920.04(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ch2900_d24abc_1954d_155.html)**, subsection II. The brief description of the reproductions should be included in Item (10) "Legends _(optional)_" of the official application form (form DM/1). See **[MPEP § 2909.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ch2900_d24abc_168f1_8d.html)**.

An international design application designating the United States may not contain a request for deferment of publication. See **[37 CFR 1.1028](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d22557_18981_2cf.html)**. In addition, specimens are not permitted in international design applications designating the United States. See **[37 CFR 1.1027](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d22557_1891e_38a.html)**.

The international design application must be presented on the "official form." Pursuant to Hague Agreement Rule 1(vi), "official form" means a form established by the International Bureau or an electronic interface made available by the International Bureau on the website of the Organization, or any form or electronic interface having the same contents and format. The form established by the International Bureau for filing an international design application is the form DM/1, "Application for International Registration". The DM/1 form and instructions for completing the form are currently available on the website of the International Bureau at **[www.wipo.int/hague/en/forms/](http://www.wipo.int/hague/en/forms/)**. The electronic interface of the International Bureau’s electronic filing system, eHague, has the same contents and format as the DM/1 form.

Proper usage of the DM/1 form will help ensure that the mandatory, additional mandatory and optional content items for an international design application are present upon filing. Detailed instructions for completing the form are set forth in the section "How to Submit an International Application to the International Bureau – e-filing or form DM/1" of the Guide to the Hague System available on WIPO’s website at **[www.wipo.int/hague/en/guide/ia.html](https://www.wipo.int/hague/en/guide/ia.html)**. Form DM/1 includes specific spaces to set forth: (1) information concerning the applicant; (2) applicant’s entitlement to file an international design application; (3) applicant’s contracting party; (4) a correspondence address for the International Bureau where there are multiple applicants and no appointed representative; (5) appointment of a representative; (6) the number of industrial designs and reproductions included in the application; (7) designated Contracting Parties; (8) the applicable product and Locarno classification (**[MPEP § 907](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ch900_d2260b_2ab9e_26e.html)**); (9) a description; (10) a description of the reproductions; (11) the identity of the creator; (12) a claim; (13) priority claim; (14) information regarding any international exhibition where any of the designs was shown; (15) exception to lack of novelty; (16) relation with a principle design; (17) a request for immediate or deferred publication; (18) reduction of the individual designation fee; and (19) the signature of the applicant or the applicant’s representative. The DM/1 form also includes a "Payment of Fees" section that allows the applicant to identity the method of payment and to instruct the International Bureau to debit the required fees to a current account established with the International Bureau.

Graphic representations executed by electronic means may be shown against a background, provided that it is neutral and plain and has only edges cut at right angles.

#### _Hague Administrative Instructions Section 405_

#### _Numbering of Reproductions and Legends_

- (a) The numbering stipulated for multiple international applications shall appear in the margin of each photograph or other graphic representation. When the same industrial design is represented from different angles, the numbering shall consist of two separate figures separated by a dot (e.g., 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc. for the first design, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, etc. for the second design, and so on).
- (b) The reproductions shall be submitted in ascending numerical order.
- (c) Legends to indicate a specific view of the product (e.g., "front view", "top view", etc.) may be indicated in association with the numbering of the reproduction.

Reproductions in international design applications must comply with the requirements of Hague Agreement Rule 9 and Part Four of the Administrative Instructions. See **[37 CFR 1.1026](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d22557_188bd_336.html)**.

Pursuant to Rule 9, the reproductions of the industrial design shall, at the option of the applicant, be in the form of photographs or other graphic representations of the industrial design itself or of the product or products which constitute the industrial design. The same product may be shown from different angles; views from different angles shall be included in different photographs or other graphic representations. Pursuant to Administrative Instruction 401, only a single copy of each reproduction should be submitted.

The reproductions must be of a quality permitting all the details of the industrial design to be clearly distinguished and permitting publication. See Rule 9(2). The reproductions should represent the industrial design alone, or the product in relation to which the industrial design is to be used, without any other object, accessory, person, or animal. However, the reproduction may show matter for which protection is not sought if such matter is indicated as provided for in Administrative Instruction 403.

Pursuant to Rule 9(3)(a), a Contracting Party may require certain specified views of the product or products which constitute the industrial design or in relation to which the industrial design is to be used, if the Contracting Party has appropriately notified the International Bureau of the required views and the circumstances under which they are required. Information concerning specified views required by a Contracting Party pursuant to Rule 9(3)(a) is set forth in the section "Specific Views" of the Guide to the Hague System available at WIPO’s website at **[www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/hague/en/ docs/hague-system-guide.pdf](https://www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/hague/en/docs/hague-system-guide.pdf)**.

Additional formal requirements for the reproductions (e.g., margins, paper, backgrounds, etc.) are set forth in the Administrative Instructions. In addition, technical requirements regarding image files, such as resolution, minimum and maximum image size, border width, etc., are set forth on the website of the International Bureau at **[www.wipo.int/hague/ en/hague_file_renew.html](https://www.wipo.int/hague/en/hague_file_renew.html)**. Reproductions may be filed through the USPTO as an office of indirect filing via the USPTO patent electronic filing system as PDF or JPEG files in accordance with the Legal Framework for Patent Electronic System. See **[MPEP §§ 502.05](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e27008.html)** and **[2909.02(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ch2900_d24b22_1e7ef_31a.html)**.

Pursuant to Rule 9(4), a Contracting Party may refuse the effects of the international registration on the ground that the reproductions contained in the international registration are not sufficient to disclose fully the industrial design. To help minimize the risk of receiving a refusal on such grounds, the International Bureau has established guidance, in consultation with examining offices, to assist applicants in preparing reproductions to help avoid refusals by examining offices on grounds of insufficient disclosure of the design. See "Guidance on Preparing and Providing Reproductions in Order to Forestall Possible Refusals on the Ground of Insufficient Disclosure of an Industrial Design by Examining Offices" available at **[www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/hague/en/docs/ guidance_reproductions.pdf](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/www.wipo.int/export/sites/www/hague/en/docs/guidance_reproductions.pdf)**.

# 2909.02(a)    Reproductions Submitted Through the USPTO Patent Electronic Filing System [R-01.2024]

Reproductions of industrial designs are required in international design applications and may be submitted as drawings, photographs, or a combination thereof, and may be in black and white or in color. See Rule 9 and Part Four of the Administrative Instructions for the Application of the Hague Agreement. Reproductions may be submitted via the USPTO patent electronic filing system as PDF or JPEG files as set forth below. Technical requirements regarding image files, such as resolution, minimum and maximum image size, border width, etc., are also set forth on the website of the International Bureau at **[www.wipo.int/hague/en/hague_file_renew.html](https://www.wipo.int/hague/en/hague_file_renew.html)**.

Reproductions may be submitted as single page PDF or JPEG files by attaching the file(s) using the "Reproductions" section of the "Upload documents" screen. Alternatively, applicants may attach reproductions as PDFs (including multi-page PDFs) using the "Upload documents" section of the "Upload documents" screen. Attaching compliant reproductions via the "Reproductions" section, rather than the "Upload documents" section, may help to avoid incurring additional per page publication fees that might otherwise be required by the International Bureau. Each image file attached through the "Reproductions" section should contain only one view of the design. The "Reproductions" section will assign a design and view number to each file attached under this section.

In accordance with the technical requirements set forth by the International Bureau, the USPTO patent electronic filing system will not permit submission of any PDF or JPEG file via the "Reproductions" section that exceeds a file size of two megabytes. For JPEG submissions, the USPTO patent electronic filing system will provide warnings where requirements pertaining to image resolution and minimum and maximum dimensions have not been satisfied; the USPTO patent electronic filing system does not check color mode or border size for JPEG images. For PDF submissions via the "Reproductions" section, the USPTO patent electronic filing system submission of any PDF file that is more than one page is not permitted. In addition, the USPTO patent electronic filing system does not check color mode, border size, resolution, or maximum or minimum dimensions of the reproduction (other than certain minimum and maximum page size dimensions) for PDF images. It is the responsibility of applicants to ensure that reproductions satisfy all applicable requirements.

Users attaching reproductions under either the "Reproductions" section or the "Upload documents" section should select the document description "Drawings – only black and white line drawings" or "Drawings – other than black and white line drawings", as appropriate. The USPTO patent electronic filing system will provide a warning to users about the possibility of incurring additional per page publication fees where reproductions are attached via the "Attach documents" section. The USPTO patent electronic filing system will also provide a warning to users where a new international design application does not contain an indication that at least one reproduction is attached. See **[MPEP § 502.05](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e27008.html)** for additional information on using the USPTO patent electronic filing system.

# 2909.03    Annexes [R-01.2024]

Annexes to the DM/1 form are used to provide certain required or optional items relevant to a particular designated Contracting Party. Annex forms (currently Annexes I-V) specific to particular Contracting Parties are available on the website of the International Bureau at **[www.wipo.int/ hague/en/forms/](http://www.wipo.int/hague/en/forms/)**.

*****

Pursuant to Hague Agreement Rule 12, an international design application is subject to the following fees: (1) basic fee; (2) publication fee(s); (3) designation fee(s); and (4) an additional word fee where the description exceeds 100 words. In addition, a transmittal fee is required for an international design application filed through the USPTO as an office of indirect filing.

The International Bureau provides an online fee calculator tool ("Hague System Fee Calculator") to help applicants quickly determine the amount of application fees that will be due (excluding any required transmittal fee). The calculator tool takes into account such factors as the number of designs and reproductions contained in the application and the Contracting Parties designated to determine the amount of the application fees that will be due in Swiss currency. The calculator tool is available at **[www.wipo.int/hague/en/fees/calculator.jsp](http://www.wipo.int/hague/en/fees/calculator.jsp)**.

## I.    **TRANSMITTAL FEE**

International design applications filed through the USPTO as an office of indirect filing are subject to payment of a transmittal fee. See **[37 CFR 1.1031(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d22557_1eb2e_2ea.html##ar_d22557_1eb7c_34c)**. Payment of the transmittal fee must be in U.S. dollars. The USPTO will not transmit the international design application to the International Bureau if the transmittal fee has not been paid. See **[37 CFR 1.1045](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d22557_1ff22_2ad.html)**. Applicants are cautioned that an international design application not received by the International Bureau within six months from the date the international design application is received by the USPTO will not be entitled to a filing date as of the date of receipt of the application by the USPTO. See Hague Agreement Rule 13.

The transmittal fee is discounted for small and micro entities. Payment, by any party, of the exact amount of the small entity transmittal fee set forth in **[37 CFR 1.1031(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d22557_1eb2e_2ea.html##ar_it_2bf29_25dec_c3)**  will be treated as a written assertion of entitlement to small entity status. See **[37 CFR 1.27](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//aia_d0e316949.html)**  and **[MPEP §§ 509.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e30961.html)** and **[509.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e31381.html)** for requirements for establishing small entity status, and **[37 CFR 1.29](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d1fc9c_19092_1c8.html)**  and **[MPEP § 509.04](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ch500_d1ff69_210b3_1ca.html)** for requirements for establishing micro entity status.

## II.    **BASIC FEE, PUBLICATION FEE(S), DESIGNATION FEE(S) AND ADDITIONAL WORD FEE**

The amount of the basic fee (Rule 12(1)(i)) is set forth in the Schedule of Fees and is dependent upon the number of designs included in the international design application. The amount of the publication fee (Rule 12(1)(iv)) is also set forth in the Schedule of Fees and is dependent upon the number of reproductions to be published and the form in which the reproductions are submitted. The Schedule of Fees is currently available on the website of the International Bureau at **[www.wipo.int/hague/ en/fees/sched.html](https://www.wipo.int/hague/en/fees/sched.html)**.

A standard or individual designation fee applies with respect to each Contracting Party designated in an international design application. The standard designation fee (Rule 12(1)(ii)) applies with respect to the designation of any Contracting Party that has not specifically set an individual designation fee. The standard designation fee varies between levels 1-3, depending on the form of examination performed by each designated Contracting Party and on any specific agreement between such Contracting Party and the International Bureau. The standard designation fees are set forth in the Schedule of Fees.

The individual designation fee (Rule 12(1)(iii)) applies where an application designates a Contracting Parties that has made a declaration under Article 7(2) of the Hague Agreement setting an individual designation fee. Individual designation fees established pursuant to Article 7(2) are set forth on the website of the International Bureau at **[www.wipo.int/hague/en/fees/individ-fee.html](https://www.wipo.int/hague/en/fees/individ-fee.html)**.

The United States has made a declaration under Article 7(2) and requires an individual designation fee that is payable in a first part at filing and second part payable upon allowance of the application by the USPTO. See **[MPEP § 2903](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ch2900_d24abb_193ad_e2.html)**. The first part of the United States designation fee consists of the combined amounts of the basic filing fee (**[37 CFR 1.16(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e314702.html##d0e314770)** ), search fee (**[37 CFR 1.16(l)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e314702.html##d0e315038)** ), and examination fee (**[37 CFR 1.16(p)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e314702.html##d0e315117)** ) for a design application, established in Swiss currency pursuant to Hague Agreement Rule 28.

The second part of the United States designation fee is the issue fee (**[37 CFR 1.18(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e315894.html##d0e315921)** ), which is payable within the period specified in a notice of allowance. See **[37 CFR 1.1031(f)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d22557_1eb2e_2ea.html##ar_it_2bf24_27372_bf)**  and **[MPEP § 2920.06](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ch2900_d24abc_1998b_2fa.html)**. The first and second parts of the individual designation fee for the United States are discounted for small and micro entities.

With respect to international design applications, the payment by any party of the small entity first part of the individual designation fee for the United States to the International Bureau will be treated as a written assertion of entitlement to small entity status. See **[37 CFR 1.27(c)(3)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//aia_d0e316949.html##aia_d0e317130)**. In addition, a micro entity certification may be signed by a person authorized to represent the applicant in the international design application under **[37 CFR 1.1041](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d22557_1fd89_6.html)**  before the International Bureau where the micro entity certification is filed with the International Bureau. See **[37 CFR 1.29(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d1fc9c_19092_1c8.html##ar_d1fc9c_1965d_1e9)**.

An additional per word fee is also required where the description exceeds 100 words. This fee is based on the description set forth in Item 9 ("Description") of the DM/1 form.

The Fee Calculation Sheet included with the DM/1 form also specifies the amounts of the basic fees, publication fees, designation fees, and the additional word fee where the description exceeds 100 words. Also included is a listing of the level of the standard designation fee applicable to respective Contracting Parties.

## III.    **PAYMENT OF FEES THROUGH THE USPTO WHEN APPLICATION FILED THROUGH USPTO AS AN OFFICE OF INDIRECT FILING**

Certain international fees payable to the International Bureau may be paid through the USPTO as an office of indirect filing, provided such fees are paid no later than the date of payment of the transmittal fee. See **[37 CFR 1.1031(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d22557_1eb2e_2ea.html##ar_d22557_1fc60_15d)**. Applicants are not required to pay such fees through the USPTO but rather may pay such fees directly to the International Bureau. Furthermore, any payment of such fees through the USPTO must be in U.S. dollars. As all payments made to the International Bureau must be in Swiss currency, the U.S. dollar amount collected may, when converted to Swiss currency, be different than the required Swiss currency amount. Accordingly, applicants are cautioned that paying such international fees through the USPTO may still result in a requirement by the International Bureau to pay additional amounts where the conversion from U.S. dollars to Swiss currency results in the International Bureau receiving less than the prescribed amounts. Any payment in response to an invitation from the International Bureau requiring additional fees must be made directly to the International Bureau within the period set in the invitation to avoid abandonment of the application pursuant to Article 8 of the Hague Agreement. To avoid receiving an invitation from the International Bureau requiring additional fees, applicants may wish to consider including authorization in the fee payment section of the DM/1 form to allow the International Bureau to debit the required fees to a current account established with the International Bureau. See Administrative Instruction 801 and **[MPEP § 2909.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ch2900_d24abc_168f1_8d.html)**.

Applicant may charge international design application fees to a USPTO deposit account when filing an international design application through the USPTO as an office of indirect filing. However, a general authorization to charge such fees will only be effective with respect to the transmittal fee required under **[37 CFR 1.1031(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d22557_1eb2e_2ea.html##ar_d22557_1eb7c_34c)**. See **[37 CFR 1.25](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e316815.html)**. In addition, international design application fees may not be paid through the USPTO after the date of payment of the transmittal fee. See **[37 CFR 1.1031(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d22557_1eb2e_2ea.html##ar_d22557_1fc60_15d)**. Nor may any renewal fees referred to in Hague Agreement Rule 24 for renewing an international registration be paid through the USPTO. See **[37 CFR 1.1031(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d22557_1eb2e_2ea.html##ar_d22557_1fd2f_130)**.

- (1) [_Right to Refuse_] The Office of any designated Contracting Party may, where the conditions for the grant of protection under the law of that Contracting Party are not met in respect of any or all of the industrial designs that are the subject of an international registration, refuse the effects, in part or in whole, of the international registration in the territory of the said Contracting Party, provided that no Office may refuse the effects, in part or in whole, of any international registration on the ground that requirements relating to the form or contents of the international application that are provided for in this Act or the Regulations or are additional to, or different from, those requirements have not been satisfied under the law of the Contracting Party concerned.

*****

The Office will examine an international design application designating the United States pursuant to Title 35 United States Code. See **[35 U.S.C. 389(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//al_d225a2_27b90_d4.html##al_d225a2_29b36_162)**. An applicant does not need to file any submissions with the Office to initiate examination of an international design application designating the United States. Rather, published international design registrations that designate the United States will be systematically received from the International Bureau pursuant to Hague Agreement Article 10(3) and examined in due course.

Upon receipt of the publication under Article 10(3), the Office will establish an application file for examination. Where the Office was also the office of indirect filing, the application file established as the office of indirect filing will be used as the application for examination, thus retaining the same application number. The Office will send a filing receipt to the applicant shortly after receipt of the publication under Article 10(3) indicating the U.S. application number, U.S. filing date, inventorship, applicant, and other relevant application data of record.

The U.S. application file will be made available to the public via Patent Center after publication under Article 10(3) of an international registration designating the United States. The U.S. application number corresponding to the international registration may be found by searching the international registration number using Patent Center. Prior to publication, access will only be provided in accordance with **[37 CFR 1.14](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//aia_d0e314245.html)**.

Pursuant to **[37 CFR 1.9(a)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//aia_d0e313866.html##aia_d0e313875)**, the term "national application" as used in the U.S. rules includes an international design application filed under the Hague Agreement in which the Office has received a copy of the international registration pursuant to Hague Agreement Article 10. Pursuant to **[37 CFR 1.9(a)(3)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//aia_d0e313866.html##aia_d0e313892)**, the term "nonprovisional application" as used in the U.S. rules includes an international design application filed under the Hague Agreement in which the Office has received a copy of the international registration pursuant to Hague Agreement Article 10. An international design application filed under the Hague Agreement in which the Office has received a copy of the international registration pursuant to Hague Agreement Article 10 is also referred to herein as a "nonprovisional international design application".

A change in the name of the applicant under **[37 CFR 1.46](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//aia_d0e317867.html)**  recorded pursuant to Hague Agreement Article 16(1)(ii) may also be effective to change the name of the applicant in a nonprovisional international design application. See **[37 CFR 1.46(c)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//aia_d0e317867.html##ar_d22550_1b8af_2c5)**. The recording of the name change pursuant to Article 16(1)(ii) must have been made no later than payment of the issue fee. Hague Agreement Article 16(1)(ii) provides for recording in the International Register by the International Bureau of a change in the name of the holder. Under Article 16(2), such recording has the same effect as if made in the office of each of the designated Contracting Parties. Thus, where the applicant under **[37 CFR 1.46](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//aia_d0e317867.html)**  in a nonprovisional international design application is the holder of the international registration, correction or update of the applicant’s name may be made through the mechanism under Article 16(1)(ii).

# 2920.04    Elements of a Nonprovisional International Design Application [R-07.2015]

# 2920.04(a)    Specification [R-07.2022]

## I.    **TITLE**

#### _37 C.F.R. 1.1067  Title, description, and inventor’s oath or declaration._

- (a) The title of the design must designate the particular article. Where a nonprovisional international design application does not contain a title of the design, the Office may establish a title. No description, other than a reference to the drawing, is ordinarily required in a nonprovisional international design application.

*****

The title of the design identifies the article in which the design is embodied by the name generally known and used by the public. In general, the practice set forth in **[MPEP § 1503.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e150455.html)** with regard to titles in design applications filed under 35 U.S.C. chapter 16 applies to nonprovisional international design applications. Thus, for example, the title may be directed to the entire article embodying the design while the claimed design, as shown in the reproductions, or as shown and described, may be directed to only a portion of the article. However, the title may not be directed to less than the claimed design.

Pursuant to **[35 U.S.C. 154(a)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e303482.html##d0e303491)**, ‘‘[e]very patent shall contain a short title of the invention. . . ’’ In addition, the application’s title of the invention is indicated on the official filing receipt and the bibliographic data sheet contained in the image file wrapper (IFW). The Hague Agreement, however, does not provide for application titles for international design applications. Nevertheless, applicants may provide an application title in a nonprovisional international design application by furnishing the title in an application data sheet in accordance with **[37 CFR 1.76](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//plt_d0e320348.html)**  or by amending the specification in accordance with **[37 CFR 1.121](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e323020.html)**  to include the application title. In the absence of an application title furnished by the applicant, the Office will establish a title by retrieving the first listed product indication appearing on the published international registration (INID code 54). See **[37 CFR 1.1067(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d22557_20f6a_11c.html##ar_d22557_20fbf_3cf)**. The title established by the Office will appear on the official filing receipt and/or bibliographic data sheet.

Since **[37 CFR 1.1067](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d22557_20f6a_11c.html)**  requires that the title must designate the particular article, and since the claim must be in formal terms to the ornamental design for the article (specifying name) as shown, or as shown and described, the title and claim must correspond (i.e., the article named in the title must correspond to the article named in the claim). See **[37 CFR 1.1025](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d22557_1885d_aa.html)**  and **[MPEP § 1503.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e150455.html)**, subsection I. When the article named in the title furnished by the applicant and the article named in the claim do not correspond, the examiner should object to the inconsistency under **[37 CFR 1.1067](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d22557_20f6a_11c.html)**  and require correction. Form paragraph **[29.59.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//fp29.59.02.html)** may be used if amendment of a title is necessary for consistency with the claim. When the applicant has furnished the title, applicant approval of an examiner’s amendment thereto is required. See **[MPEP § 1302.04](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e131704.html)**. When the Office has established the title, applicant approval of an examiner’s amendment thereto is not required.

Any amendment to the language of the title should also be made at each occurrence of the language of the title throughout the application, except in the oath or declaration. If the article named in the title is not present in the original figure descriptions, it is not necessary to incorporate the article into the figure descriptions as part of any amendment to the language of the title. Product indications required under Article 5(1)(iv) of the Hague Agreement (see **[MPEP § 2909](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ch2900_d24abb_27235_1dd.html)**) set forth in the specification may differ from the article named in the title and in the claim, as product indications "shall preferably be identified by using terms" appearing in the Locarno classification. See Rule 7(3)(iv). The form paragraphs below may be used in nonprovisional international design applications as appropriate.

# ¶ 15.05.01    Title of Design Invention

The title of a design must designate the name of the article in which the design is embodied or applied to. In addition, the title must correspond with the claim. See **[MPEP § 1503.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e150455.html)** and **[37 CFR 1.153](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//aia_d0e324221.html)**  or **[MPEP § 2920.04(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ch2900_d24abc_1954d_155.html)** and **[37 CFR 1.1067](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d22557_20f6a_11c.html)**.

## II.    **DESCRIPTION**

#### _37 C.F.R. 1.1067  Title, description, and inventor’s oath or declaration._

- (a) The title of the design must designate the particular article. Where a nonprovisional international design application does not contain a title of the design, the Office may establish a title. No description, other than a reference to the drawing, is ordinarily required in a nonprovisional international design application.

*****

No description of the design in the specification beyond a brief description of the drawing is generally necessary, since as a rule the illustration in the drawing views is its own best description. _In re Freeman,_ 23 App. D.C. 226 (App. D.C. 1904). However, while not required, such a description is not prohibited and may be incorporated into the specification. Descriptions of the figures are not required to be written in any particular format, however, if they do not describe the views of the drawing clearly and accurately, the examiner should object to the unclear and/or inaccurate descriptions and suggest language which provides a clear and accurate description of the views.

Applicants are cautioned against using "reference view" as a figure description in international design applications designating the United States. While "reference view" is commonly used in some foreign countries as a figure description, this term does not have any special meaning in U.S practice. Accordingly, the reference view will be treated as another view of the design, and any inconsistencies between the reference view and the other figures of the claimed design may cause uncertainty as to the scope of the claim, resulting in a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**  and **[(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)**, as nonenabling and indefinite. A reference view described in the description as not included in the claimed design may result in uncertainty as the scope of the design claimed where the reference view includes features of the claimed design shown in the other views.

In addition to the figure descriptions, statements that are permissible in the specification of a design application filed under 35 U.S.C. chapter 16 are permissible in the specification of a nonprovisional international design application. See **[MPEP § 1503.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e150455.html)**, subsection II for a list of such permissible statements. This includes, for example, statements indicating the nature and environmental use of the claimed design, and statements indicating the purpose of broken lines in the drawing, for example, environmental structure or boundaries that form no part of the design to be patented. In addition, Administrative Instruction 403 permits matter shown in a reproduction for which protection is not sought to be indicated in the description and/or by means of broken or dotted lines or coloring. Accordingly, the specification may include statements explaining that protection is not sought for certain features shown in the reproduction, or that protection is not sought for matter shown in a specified color in the reproduction. When protection is not sought for portions of subject matter shown in a reproduction, applicants are strongly encouraged to indicate such subject matter by means of broken lines (or coloring) **and** include a statement in the specification explaining the meaning of the broken lines (or coloring). See **[MPEP § 2920.05(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ch2900_d24abc_19807_39d.html)** .

The specification of a nonprovisional international design application is not permitted to include statements describing matters that are directed to function or are unrelated to the design. In addition, the specification may not include statements that describe or suggest other embodiments of the claimed design which are not illustrated in the drawing disclosure, except one that is a mirror image of that shown or has a shape and appearance that would be evident from the one shown. However, such statements may be included in the design application as originally filed to provide antecedent basis for a future amendment. In addition, statements which attempt to broaden the scope of the claimed design beyond that which is shown in the drawings are not permitted.

The form paragraphs set forth in **[MPEP § 1503.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e150455.html)**, subsection II, pertaining to the description may be used in nonprovisional international design applications. In addition, the following form paragraphs may be used to amend the specification by examiner’s amendment to include figure descriptions and/or a description of broken lines or coloring, as appropriate:

# ¶ 29.60.02    Objection to Specification - Missing Figure Descriptions

The specification is objected to under **[37 CFR 1.1067](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d22557_20f6a_11c.html)**  for failing to provide figure descriptions. The description should indicate the type of view shown in the corresponding figure, such as "front view," "perspective view," "top view," etc.

### Examiner Note:

If some, but not all, figure descriptions are missing, the examiner should indicate which descriptions are missing, e.g. "Descriptions for Figures [add numbers of figures without a corresponding description] have not been provided."

# ¶ 29.22    Description of Broken Lines Added by Examiner's Amendment (International Design Application)

The following sentence has been added to the specification immediately preceding the claim:

> --The broken line showing of **[1]** is for the purpose of illustrating **[2]** and forms no part of the claimed design.--

### Examiner Note:

1. This form paragraph should only be used in an international design application in an Examiner's Amendment for explaining the meaning of the broken lines.

2. In bracket 1, insert name of structure.

3. In bracket 2, insert --portions of the "article"-- or --environmental structure--.

## III.    **CLAIM**

#### _37 C.F.R. 1.1025  The claim._

The specific wording of the claim in an international design application designating the United States shall be in formal terms to the ornamental design for the article (specifying name of article) as shown, or as shown and described. More than one claim is neither required nor permitted for purposes of the United States.

The form and content of a claim in a nonprovisional international design application is set forth in **[37 CFR 1.1025](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d22557_1885d_aa.html)**.

A design patent application may only include a single claim. The specific wording of the claim must be in formal terms to the ornamental design for the article (the article which embodies the design or to which it is applied) as shown, or as shown and described. The description of the article in the claim should be consistent in terminology with the title of the invention. See **[MPEP § 2920.04(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ch2900_d24abc_1954d_155.html)**, subsection I.

When the specification includes a proper descriptive statement of the design (see **[MPEP § 2920.04(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ch2900_d24abc_1954d_155.html)**, subsection II), or a proper showing of modified forms of the design or other descriptive matter has been included in the specification, the words "and described" must be added to the claim following the term "shown"; i.e., the claim must read "The ornamental design for (the article which embodies the design or to which it is applied) as shown and described." Unless the claim was amended by the applicant pursuant to **[37 CFR 1.121](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e323020.html)**, the examiner should not object to the claim as to matters of form but rather should amend the claim by examiner’s amendment to include the words "and described."

Form paragraphs **[15.62](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//fp15.62.html)**, **[15.63](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//fp15.63.html)** and **[15.64](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//fp15.64.html)** may be used in international design applications as appropriate.

# ¶ 15.62    Amend Claim "As Shown"

For proper form (**[37 CFR 1.153](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e324221.html)**   or **[37 CFR 1.1025](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d22557_1885d_aa.html)** ), the claim **[1]** amended to read: "**[2]** claim: The ornamental design for **[3]** as shown."

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 1, insert --must be-- or --has been--.

2. In bracket 2, insert --I-- or --We--.

3. In bracket 3, insert title of the article in which the design is embodied or applied.

# ¶ 15.63    Amend Claim "As Shown and Described"

For proper form (**[37 CFR 1.153](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e324221.html)**  or **[37 CFR 1.1025](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d22557_1885d_aa.html)** ), the claim **[1]** amended to read: "**[2]** claim: The ornamental design for **[3]** as shown and described."

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 1, insert reason.

2. In bracket 2, insert --must be-- or --has been--.

# 2920.04(b)    Reproductions (Drawing Figures) [R-07.2022]

#### _37 C.F.R. 1.1026  Reproductions._

Reproductions shall comply with the requirements of Rule 9 and Part Four of the Administrative Instructions.

Every nonprovisional international design application must include a reproduction of the claimed design. A reproduction may be either a drawing, in black and white or in color, or a photograph of the industrial design. As the drawing or photograph constitutes the entire visual disclosure of the claim, it is of utmost importance that the drawing or photograph be a clear and complete depiction of the design applied to the article designated in the title, and that nothing regarding the design sought to be patented is left to conjecture.

Formal requirements for reproductions applicable to nonprovisional international design applications are set forth in Hague Agreement Rule 9 and Part Four of the Administrative Instructions. See **[37 CFR 1.1026](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d22557_188bd_336.html)**. Hague Agreement Rule 9 and the relevant provisions of the Administrative Instructions are reproduced in **[MPEP § 2909.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ch2900_d24abc_1706a_258.html)**. Drawing requirements set forth in **[37 CFR 1.84](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e320999.html)**  do not apply to nonprovisional international design applications, except for those set forth in **[37 CFR 1.84(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e320999.html##d0e321067)**. See **[37 CFR 1.1061(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d22557_20942_64.html##ar_d22557_209a4_3c8)**.

Figure numbering requirements for international design applications are different from figure numbering requirements for design applications filed under 35 U.S.C. chapter 16. Pursuant to Administrative Instruction 405, "[w]hen the same industrial design is represented from different angles, the numbering shall consist of two separate figures separated by a dot (e.g., 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc. for the first design, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, etc. for the second design, and so on)." The figure numbering appearing in the published international registration should be preserved during prosecution of the nonprovisional international design application before the USPTO. If designs are cancelled, for example, as a result of a restriction requirement, applicants should not renumber the figures of the remaining design(s).

Reproductions published as part of the international registration have been reviewed by the International Bureau for compliance with the formal requirements of Hague Agreement Rule 9 and Part Four of the Administrative Instructions and thus should not be objected to by the examiner on such grounds. See Hague Agreement Article 12(1). Amended reproductions that are submitted directly to the Office pursuant to **[37 CFR 1.121](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e323020.html)**  are not subject to review by the International Bureau and thus may be objected to under **[37 CFR 1.1026](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d22557_188bd_336.html)**  as to matters of form where appropriate. Form Paragraph **[29.10](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//fp29.10.html)** may be used to object to amended reproductions that fail to comply with the formal requirements of Hague Agreement Rule 9 and Part Four of the Administrative Instructions.

# ¶ 29.10    Reproductions Objected to, Amended Reproductions Do Not Comply With Formal Requirements

The amended reproductions received on **[1]** are objected to because **[2]**. See **[37 CFR 1.1026](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d22557_188bd_336.html)**.

### Examiner Note:

1. Use this form paragraph in an international design application to object to amended reproductions that fail to comply with the formal requirements for reproductions set forth in Rule 9 of the Common Regulations Under the 1999 Act and the 1960 Act of the Hague Agreement and Part Four of the Administrative Instructions thereunder. Do not use this form paragraph to object to reproductions that were contained in the international registration published by the International Bureau.

2. In bracket 1, insert the date the amended reproductions were received.

3. In bracket 2, insert the reason for the objection, for example, --the reproductions are not of a quality permitting all the details of the industrial design to be clearly distinguished-- or --the reproductions contain explanatory text or legends--.

4. Follow this form paragraph with form paragraph **[15.05.04](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//fp15.05.04.html)**.

When inconsistencies are found among the views, the examiner should object to the reproductions and request that the views be made consistent. Pursuant to Hague Agreement Rule 9(4), "[a] Contracting Party may however refuse the effects of the international registration on the ground that the reproductions contained in the international registration are not sufficient to disclose fully the industrial design." When the inconsistencies are of such magnitude that the overall appearance of the design is unclear, the claim should be rejected under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**  and **[(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)**, as nonenabling and indefinite. See **[MPEP § 1504.04](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e156290.html)**, subsection I.

# ¶ 29.11    Reproductions Objected to, Design Not Fully Disclosed in Reproductions

The reproductions are objected to for failing to fully disclose the industrial design because **[1]**. See **[37 CFR 1.1026](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d22557_188bd_336.html)**  and Rule 9 of the Common Regulations Under the 1999 Act and the 1960 Act of the Hague Agreement.

### Examiner Note:

1. Use this form paragraph in an international design application where the reproductions are not sufficient to fully disclose the industrial design, but such failure does not render the claimed invention non-enabled and/or indefinite under **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e302824912.html)**. This may occur, for example, where there are minor inconsistencies in the illustration of the design among the different views of the design. Where the failure to fully disclose the industrial design in the reproductions renders the claimed invention non-enabled and/or indefinite under **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e302824912.html)**, use form paragraph **[15.21](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//fp15.21.html)** or **[15.22](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//fp15.22.html)**, as appropriate, instead of this form paragraph.

2. In bracket 1, explain why the reproductions are not sufficient to fully disclose the industrial design.

3. Follow this form paragraph with form paragraph **[15.05.04](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//fp15.05.04.html)**.

The practice set forth in **[MPEP § 1503.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e151275.html)**, subsections I-IV with respect to views, surface shading, broken lines, and surface treatment is generally applicable to nonprovisional international design applications.

In addition to the use of broken or dotted lines to indicate matter shown in a reproduction for which protection is not sought, Administrative Instruction 403 permits such matter to be indicated in the description and/or by coloring. See **[MPEP § 2920.05(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ch2900_d24abc_19807_39d.html)** regarding considerations under **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e302824912.html)**  when indicating matter pursuant to Administrative Instruction 403. Form paragraph **[29.20](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//fp29.20.html)** may be used in an international design application as appropriate.

# ¶ 29.20    Matter Not Forming Part of Design (International Design Application)

Matter, such as environmental structure or portions of the "article," which is shown in a reproduction but for which protection is not sought may be indicated by statement in the description and/or by means of dotted or broken lines or coloring in the reproduction. See **[37 CFR 1.1026](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d22557_188bd_336.html)**  and Hague Agreement Administrative Instruction 403.

See **[37 CFR 1.1021(d)(3)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d22557_1676c_6e.html##ar_d22557_1746a_6c)**. The International Bureau reviews international design applications designating the United States to ensure that the required inventor’s oath or declaration is provided for the inventors identified in the international design application. The inventor’s oath or declaration is communicated by the International Bureau to the Office when the published international registration is sent to the Office pursuant to Hague Agreement Article 10(3).

Section **[1.1067(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d22557_20f6a_11c.html##ar_d22557_20fda_3cb)**  provides for notifying the applicant in a notice of allowability of a requirement to provide the inventor’s oath or declaration. As compliance with the requirement for the inventor’s oath or declaration will have been reviewed by the International Bureau, the need to notify the applicant in a notice of allowability that an inventor’s oath or declaration is required should be rare, e.g., where an inventor is added pursuant to **[37 CFR 1.48(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e317930.html##d0e317941)**  after publication of the international registration and an executed oath or declaration from the inventor has not been received. See **[37 CFR 1.48(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e317930.html##d0e317988)**.

# 2920.05    Examination [R-07.2015]

- (a) _Examination._ The Office shall make an examination pursuant to title 35, United States Code, of an international design application designating the United States.
- (b) _Timing._ For each international design application to be examined under paragraph (a) of this section, the Office shall, subject to Rule 18(1)(c)(ii), send to the International Bureau within 12 months from the publication of the international registration under Rule 26(3) a notification of refusal (§ **[1.1063](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d22557_20a70_288.html)** ) where it appears that the applicant is not entitled to a patent under the law with respect to any industrial design that is the subject of the international registration.

#### _37 C.F.R. 1.1063  Notification of Refusal._

- (a) A notification of refusal shall contain or indicate:
    - (1) The number of the international registration;
    - (2) The grounds on which the refusal is based;
    - (3) A copy of a reproduction of the earlier industrial design and information concerning the earlier industrial design, where the grounds of refusal refer to similarity with an industrial design that is the subject of an earlier application or registration;
    - (4) Where the refusal does not relate to all the industrial designs that are the subject of the international registration, those to which it relates or does not relate; and
    - (5) A time period for reply under §§ **[1.134](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e323607.html)**  and **[1.136](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e323655.html)**, where a reply to the notification of refusal is required.
- (b) Any reply to the notification of refusal must be filed directly with the Office and not through the International Bureau. The requirements of § **[1.111](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e322449.html)**  shall apply to a reply to a notification of refusal.

International design applications designating the United States are examined pursuant to title 35, United States Code. All questions of substance and, unless otherwise required by the Hague Agreement or Regulations thereunder, procedures regarding an international design application designating the United States shall be determined as in the case of design applications filed under 35 U.S.C. chapter 16. See **[35 U.S.C. 389](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//al_d225a2_27b90_d4.html)**. Accordingly, the practices set forth in **[MPEP §§ 1504.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e152237.html)** (Statutory Subject Matter for Designs), **[1504.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e153408.html)** (Novelty), **[1504.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e154792.html)** (Nonobviousness), **[1504.04](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e156290.html)** (Considerations Under 35 U.S.C. 112), **[1504.05](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e157283.html)** (Restriction), and **[1504.06](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e159187.html)** (Double Patenting) are generally applicable to international design applications designating the United States.

While there is substantial overlap in examining practices with respect to international design applications designating the United States and design applications filed under 35 U.S.C. chapter 16, there are also differences. These differences include:

- (1) the Office sends a Notification of Refusal to the International Bureau for forwarding to the holder of the international registration where it is determined that the conditions for the grant of a patent are not met in respect of any or all designs that are the subject of international registration;
- (2) upon issuance of a patent, the Office sends a statement of grant of protection to the International Bureau indicating that protection is granted in the United States to those designs that are the subject of the international registration and covered by the patent.

Regulations concerning international design applications are set forth in 37 CFR Part 1, subpart I.

*****

#### _37 C.F.R. 1.1063  Notification of Refusal._

- (a) A notification of refusal shall contain or indicate:
    - (1) The number of the international registration;
    - (2) The grounds on which the refusal is based;
    - (3) A copy of a reproduction of the earlier industrial design and information concerning the earlier industrial design, where the grounds of refusal refer to similarity with an industrial design that is the subject of an earlier application or registration;
    - (4) Where the refusal does not relate to all the industrial designs that are the subject of the international registration, those to which it relates or does not relate; and
    - (5) A time period for reply under §§ **[1.134](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e323607.html)**  and **[1.136](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e323655.html)**, where a reply to the notification of refusal is required.
- (b) Any reply to the notification of refusal must be filed directly with the Office and not through the International Bureau. The requirements of § **[1.111](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e322449.html)**  shall apply to a reply to a notification of refusal.

Under Article 12 of the Hague Agreement, "[t]he Office of any designated Contracting Party may, where the conditions for the grant of protection under the law of that Contracting Party are not met in respect of any or all of the industrial designs that are the subject of an international registration, refuse the effects, in part or in whole, of the international registration in the territory of the said Contracting Party, provided that no Office may refuse the effects, in part or in whole, of any international registration on the ground that requirements relating to the form or contents of the international design application that are provided for in this Act or the Regulations or are additional to, or different from, those requirements have not been satisfied under the law of the Contracting Party concerned." This refusal of the effects of an international registration is called a "notification of refusal." See Article 12(2). The notification of refusal is transmitted to the International Bureau who, without delay, transmits a copy of the notification to the holder of the international registration. Hague Agreement Rule 18 prescribes a time period for sending of the notification of refusal and the content of the notification.

In accordance with **[37 CFR 1.1062(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d22557_209ed_3c1.html##ar_d226d9_349f1_2e5)**, a notification of refusal is to be sent to the International Bureau within 12 months from the publication of the international registration where it appears that the applicant is not entitled to a patent under the law of the United States with respect to any industrial design that is the subject of the international registration. The notification of refusal may be sent after this 12-month period where the failure to send the notification within the 12-month period was unintentional.

The notification of refusal contains or indicates: (1) the number of the international registration; (2) the grounds on which the refusal is based; (3) a copy of a reproduction of the earlier industrial design and information concerning the earlier industrial design, where the grounds of refusal refer to similarity with an industrial design that is the subject of an earlier application or registration; (4) where the refusal does not relate to all the industrial designs that are the subject of the international registration, those to which it relates or does not relate; and (5) a time period for reply under **[37 CFR 1.134](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e323607.html)**  and **[1.136](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e323655.html)**  where a reply to the notification of refusal is required. See **[37 CFR 1.1063(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d22557_20a70_288.html##ar_d22557_20ac4_39d)**.

The grounds of refusal may be in the form of a rejection based on a condition for patentability under title 35, United States Code (e.g., **[35 U.S.C. 171](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e304480.html)**, **[102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//al_d1fbe1_234ed_52.html)**, **[103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//al_d1fbe1_19797_b0.html)**, or **[112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e302824912.html)** ), a requirement for restriction (where more than one independent and distinct design is presented in the application), and/or an objection (where not prohibited by Article 12(1) of the Hague Agreement). The grounds of refusal may also be based on applicant’s action taken prior to examination, including cancellation of industrial designs in the international design application by amendment, or by an express abandonment of the application pursuant to **[37 CFR 1.138](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e324013.html)**  or the renunciation of the designation of the United States (see **[MPEP § 2930](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ch2900_d24abc_199d6_16d.html)**).

Objections based on requirements relating to the form or content of the application provided for in the Hague Agreement and Regulations thereunder are not prohibited by Article 12(1) where the International Bureau is not responsible for verifying compliance with such requirements. Such may arise, for example, where the applicant submits amended drawings directly to the Office in the course of examination that fail to comply with the formal requirements applicable to reproductions under Hague Agreement Rule 9 and Part Four of the Administrative Instructions. Nor does Article 12(1) prohibit objections based on inconsistencies among the views of the reproductions or incorrect or inaccurate statements contained in the description.

As in the case of Office actions in design applications filed under 35 U.S.C. chapter 16, copies of references cited by the examiner should be included with the notification of refusal. In addition, because Hague Agreement Rule 18(2)(b)(iv) does not distinguish references used in a ground of refusal based on where the reference originated from, the examiner should also include any U.S. patent or U.S. patent application publication used in a grounds of refusal (e.g., a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//al_d1fbe1_234ed_52.html)**  or **[103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//al_d1fbe1_19797_b0.html)** ). See **[37 CFR 1.1063(a)(3)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d22557_20a70_288.html##ar_d22557_20b2e_2de)**. Copies of references cited by the applicant in an information disclosure statement do not need to be included with the notification of refusal.

The notification of refusal should include a time period for reply under **[37 CFR 1.134](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e323607.html)**  and **[1.136](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e323655.html)**  to avoid abandonment where a reply to the notification of refusal is required. This time period will normally be made in the Office Action Summary, Form PTOL-326, accompanying a Notification of Refusal cover sheet, Form PTO-2319. Not all notifications of refusal will require a reply. For example, where the international registration contains multiple industrial designs and all but one design is cancelled by preliminary amendment prior to examination, and the remaining design is determined by the examiner to be allowable, then a notice of allowance will be sent concurrently with a notification of refusal, refusing the effects of the international registration in the United States with respect to the industrial design or designs that have been cancelled. Such a notification of refusal, otherwise known as a "Notification of Partial Refusal," (Form PTO-2321) will be communicated to the International Bureau but will not set a time period for reply to the notification of refusal, as no reply to the refusal is required.

The Hague system does not require any submission from the applicant to the USPTO to initiate examination of a nonprovisional international design application. In many cases the applicant will not have retained the services of an attorney or agent registered to practice before the USPTO ("patent practitioner") prior to receipt of the notification of refusal. Where there is no patent practitioner of record, the examiner should include the following form paragraph in the refusal to remind applicants of the signature requirements applicable to a reply to a notification of refusal:

# ¶ 29.100    Reply Reminder

Applicant is reminded that any reply to this communication must be signed either by a patent practitioner (i.e., a patent attorney or agent registered to practice before the United States Patent and Trademark Office) or by the applicant. If the applicant is a juristic entity, the reply must be signed by a patent practitioner. See **[37 CFR 1.33(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//aia_d0e317491.html##aia_d0e317540)**.

### Examiner Note:

Add this paragraph at the end of a notification of refusal or other Office action where a patent attorney or agent registered to practice before the United States Patent and Trademark Office has not been appointed as applicant's representative. If this paragraph was included in a prior Office action, it may be, but is not required to be, included in a subsequent Office action.

In addition, the following form paragraph may be included in the notification of refusal to provide information to applicants regarding who may discuss the merits of the application with the examiner:

# ¶ 29.101    Discussion of the Merits of the Application

All discussions between the applicant and the examiner regarding the merits of a pending application will be considered an interview and are to be made of record. See **[MPEP § 713](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e84376.html)**. The examiner will not discuss the merits of the application with applicant's representative if the representative is not registered to practice before the USPTO. Appointment as applicant’s representative before the International Bureau pursuant to Rule 3 of the Common Regulations under the Hague Agreement does **NOT** entitle such representative to represent the applicant before the USPTO. Furthermore, an applicant that is a juristic entity **must** be represented by a patent attorney or agent registered to practice before the USPTO. Additional information regarding interviews is set forth below.

**Telephonic or in person interviews**

A telephonic or in person interview may only be conducted with an attorney or agent registered to practice before the USPTO ("registered practitioner") or with a _pro se_ applicant (an applicant who is the inventor and who is not represented by a registered practitioner).

The registered practitioner may either be of record or not of record. To become "of record," a power of attorney (POA) in accordance with **[37 CFR 1.32](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//aia_d0e317381.html)**  must be filed in the application. Form PTO/AIA/80 "Power of Attorney to Prosecute Applications Before the USPTO," available at **[www.uspto.gov/ patent/forms/forms-patent-applications-filed-or-after-september-16-2012](https://www.uspto.gov/patent/forms/forms-patent-applications-filed-or-after-september-16-2012)**, may be used for this purpose. See **[MPEP § 402.02(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ch400_d1fe3a_237c2_34b.html)** for further information. Interviews may also be conducted with a registered practitioner not of record provided the registered practitioner can show authorization to conduct an interview by completing, signing and filing an "Applicant Initiated Interview Request Form" (PTOL-413A) (available at the USPTO web page indicated above). See **[MPEP § 405](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e22262.html)**. For acceptable ways to submit forms to the USPTO, see "When Responding to Official USPTO Correspondence" below.

### Examiner Note:

Add this paragraph at the end of the Refusal where a patent attorney or agent registered to practice before the United States Patent and Trademark Office has not been appointed as applicant's representative.

Any reply to the notification of refusal must be filed directly with the Office and not through the International Bureau. See **[37 CFR 1.1063(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d22557_20a70_288.html##ar_d22557_20bd9_223)**. A reply to the notification of refusal is subject to the requirements of **[37 CFR 1.111](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e322449.html)**.

Any further Office action following the notification of refusal, such as a Final Rejection, will normally be sent directly to the applicant.

# 2920.05(b)    One Independent and Distinct Design [R-07.2022]

#### _Hague Article 13_

#### _Special Requirements Concerning Unity of Design_

- (1) [_Notification of Special Requirements_] Any Contracting Party whose law, at the time it becomes party to this Act, requires that designs that are the subject of the same application conform to a requirement of unity of design, unity of production or unity of use, or belong to the same set or composition of items, or that only one independent and distinct design may be claimed in a single application, may, in a declaration, notify the Director General accordingly. However, no such declaration shall affect the right of an applicant to include two or more industrial designs in an international application in accordance with Article 5(4), even if the application designates the Contracting Party that has made the declaration.
- (2) [_Effect of Declaration_]Any such declaration shall enable the Office of the Contracting Party that has made it to refuse the effects of the international registration pursuant to Article 12(1) pending compliance with the requirement notified by that Contracting Party.

- (a) Only one independent and distinct design may be claimed in a nonprovisional international design application.
- (b) If the requirements under paragraph (a) of this section are not satisfied, the examiner shall in the notification of refusal or other Office action require the applicant in the reply to that action to elect one independent and distinct design for which prosecution on the merits shall be restricted. Such requirement will normally be made before any action on the merits but may be made at any time before the final action. Review of any such requirement is provided under §§ **[1.143](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e324130.html)**  and **[1.144](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e324143.html)**.

Only one independent and distinct design may be claimed in a nonprovisional international design application. See **[37 CFR 1.1064](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d22557_20d74_15f.html)**. Under Article 13 of the Hague Agreement, a Contracting Party whose law at the time it becomes party to the Hague Agreement requires, inter alia, that only one independent and distinct design may be claimed in a single application, can refuse the effects of the international registration on grounds of noncompliance with such requirement. U.S. law requires that only one independent and distinct design may be claimed in a single application. See _In re Rubinfield,_ 270 F.2d 391, 123 USPQ 210 (CCPA 1959); _In re Platner,_ 155 USPQ 222 (Comm’r Pat. 1967); **[MPEP § 1504.05](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e157283.html)**. The practice set forth in **[MPEP § 1504.05](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e157283.html)** is generally applicable to nonprovisional international design applications. If more than one independent and distinct design is claimed in the nonprovisional international design application, the examiner should in the notification of refusal or other Office action require the applicant in the reply to that action to elect one independent and distinct design for which prosecution on the merits shall be restricted. The requirement should normally be made before any action on the merits but may be made at any time before the final action. Review of any such requirement is provided under **[37 CFR 1.143](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e324130.html)**  and **[1.144](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e324143.html)**.

Renumbering of the figures following cancellation of non-elected embodiments is not required. See **[MPEP § 2920.04(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ch2900_d24abc_195fb_2d.html)**. In addition, applicants should consider the need to correct inventorship under **[37 CFR 1.48](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e317930.html)**  as a result of a restriction requirement and further note that correction of inventorship after an Office action on the merits is subject to an additional fee under **[37 CFR 1.48(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e317930.html##d0e318008)**. See **[MPEP § 602.01(c)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ch600_d2002c_231e9_20c.html)**. Examiners should use FP **[29.102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//fp29.102.html)** to remind applicants that renumbering of the drawing figures following cancellation of non-elected embodiments is not required and to consider the need to correct inventorship due to the cancellation of non-elected designs.

# ¶ 29.102    Reply Reminder for Restriction Requirements Concerning Figure Numbering

In replying to this Refusal electing a Group for prosecution, applicant should also consider amending the application to cancel the drawing figures and remove the description corresponding to the nonelected Group(s), and to correct inventorship, as appropriate, resulting from such amendment pursuant to **[37 CFR 1.48](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e317930.html)**. See **[MPEP § 602.01(c)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ch600_d2002c_231e9_20c.html)**. Applicant should note that correcting inventorship after an Office action on the merits has been given or mailed in the application will require an additional fee pursuant to **[37 CFR 1.48(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e317930.html##d0e318008)**.

Renumbering of the drawing figures is not required. To maintain consistency with the published International Registration, it is recommended that the numbering of the drawing figures included in the elected Group not be changed even if non-elected embodiments are cancelled. Any amendment to the drawing figures should comply with **[37 CFR 1.1026](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d22557_188bd_336.html)**  and Part Four of the Administrative Instructions (in particular, see Section 405 of the Administrative Instructions with respect to numbering of reproductions).

### Examiner Note:

Add this paragraph at the end of a restriction requirement in a nonprovisional international design application. If there is no patent practitioner of record, also include form paragraph **[29.100](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//fp29.100.html)** Reply Reminder.

Protection of designs cancelled from a nonprovisional international design application as a result of a restriction requirement may be pursued through the filing of a divisional application(s). Such a divisional application may be filed either as a design application under 35 U.S.C. chapter 16 or as an international design application designating the United States. For further information regarding divisional applications, see **[MPEP § 2920.05(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ch2900_d24abc_1991a_125.html)**.

# 2920.05(c)    Considerations Under 35 U.S.C. 112 [R-07.2015]

The requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**  and **[(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)**  apply to nonprovisional international design applications. See **[35 U.S.C. 389](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//al_d225a2_27b90_d4.html)**. Accordingly, the practice set forth in **[MPEP § 1504.04](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e156290.html)** regarding considerations under **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e302824912.html)**  is generally applicable to nonprovisional international design applications. This section addresses certain additional considerations relevant to international design applications.

As discussed in **[MPEP § 2920.04(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ch2900_d24abc_195fb_2d.html)**, Administrative Instruction 403 allows matter shown in a reproduction for which protection is not sought to be indicated "(i) in the description referred to in Rule 7(5)(a) and/or (ii) by means of dotted or broken lines or coloring." When using broken or dotted lines or coloring in a reproduction to indicate matter shown in a reproduction for which protection is not sought, applicants are encouraged to include an explanation of the purpose of the broken or dotted lines or coloring in the description. This may help to avoid uncertainty as to the scope of the claimed design. Similarly, applicants are encouraged not to simply rely on a description to indicate matter shown in a reproduction for which protection is not sought, but rather to also identify the matter for which protection is not sought through the use of broken or dotted lines or coloring.

The following form paragraphs may be used where the presence of undescribed broken lines or color renders the scope of the claimed design unclear.

# ¶ 29.21    Rejection, 35 U.S.C. 112(b) - Undescribed Broken Lines (International Design Application)

The claim is rejected for failing to particularly point out and distinctly claim the invention as required in **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)**. The claim is indefinite because the reproductions include, in figure(s) **[1]**, broken lines that are not described in the specification, and the scope of the claimed design cannot be determined.

If the broken line(s) represent portions of the article or environmental structure for which protection is not sought, applicant may overcome this rejection by inserting a statement similar to the following into the specification immediately preceding the claim, provided such statement does not introduce new matter (see **[35 U.S.C. 132](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e303187.html)** ):

> --The broken line showing of **[2]** is for the purpose of illustrating **[3]** and forms no part of the claimed design.--

### Examiner Note:

1. Use this form paragraph in an international design application where the reproductions include broken lines that are not described in the specification, and the scope of the claimed design cannot be determined.

2. In bracket 1, insert the number(s) of the figure(s) containing the broken lines.

3. In bracket 2, insert name of structure.

4. In bracket 3, insert --portions of the "article"-- or --environmental structure--.

# ¶ 29.23    Rejection, 35 U.S.C. 112(b) - Undescribed Broken Lines as Boundary of Design (International Design Application)

The claim is rejected for failing to particularly point out and distinctly claim the invention as required in **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)**. The claim is indefinite because the reproductions include, in figure(s) **[1]**, broken lines that are not described in the specification, and the scope of the claimed design cannot be determined.

If the broken lines represent a boundary line for which protection is not sought, applicant may overcome this rejection by inserting a statement similar to the following into the specification immediately preceding the claim, provided such statement does not introduce new matter (see **[35 U.S.C. 132](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e303187.html)** ):

> --The **[2]** broken line(s) define the bounds of the claimed design and form no part thereof.--

### Examiner Note:

1. Use this form paragraph in an international design application where the reproductions include broken lines that are not described in the specification, and the scope of the claimed design cannot be determined.

2. In bracket 1, insert the number(s) of the figure(s) containing the broken lines.

3. In bracket 2, insert type of broken line, e.g. dashed or dot-dash or dot-dot-dash.

# ¶ 29.25    Rejection, 35 U.S.C. 112(b) - Unclear Use of Coloring (International Design Application)

The claim is rejected for failing to particularly point out and distinctly claim the invention as required in **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)**. The claim is indefinite because the reproductions include coloring, in figure(s) **[1]**, that is not described in the specification, and the scope of the claimed design cannot be determined.

If the coloring identifies matter for which protection is not sought, applicant may overcome this rejection by inserting a statement similar to the following into the specification immediately preceding the claim, provided such statement does not introduce new matter (see **[35 U.S.C. 132](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e303187.html)**  ):

> --The portion of the design shown in the color **[2]** is for the purpose of illustrating **[3]** and forms no part of the claimed design.--

### Examiner Note:

1. Use this form paragraph in an international design application where the reproductions include coloring that is not described in the specification, and the scope of the claimed design cannot be determined.

2. In bracket 1, insert the number(s) of the figure(s) containing the coloring.

3. In bracket 2, identify the color indicating the matter excluded from the claim.

4. In bracket 3, insert --portions of the "article"-- or --environmental structure--.

Similar to the use of form paragraph **[15.20.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//fp15.20.02.html)** in design applications filed under 35 U.S.C. chapter 16, form paragraph **[29.27](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//fp29.27.html)** may be used in an international design application to suggest how a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**  and **[(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)**  as nonenabling and indefinite due to an insufficient drawing disclosure may be overcome.

# ¶ 29.27    Suggestion To Overcome Rejection Under 35 U.S.C. 112(a) and (b) (International Design Application)

Applicant may indicate that protection is not sought for those portions of the reproductions which are considered indefinite and nonenabling in the rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e302824912.html)**  above by amending the reproductions to color those portions or convert those portions to broken lines and by amending the specification to include a statement that the portions of the **[1]** shown in broken lines form no part of the claimed design or a statement that the portions of the **[1]** shown by coloring form no part of the claimed design provided such amendments do not introduce new matter (see **[35 U.S.C. 132](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e303187.html)**  , **[37 CFR 1.121](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e323020.html)**  ).

Pursuant to Administrative Instruction 408, a priority claim made in accordance with Hague Agreement Rule 7(5)(c) may be accompanied by a WIPO Digital Access Service (DAS) access code, if available. The official form for the application for international registration (the DM/1 form or the electronic interface of the International Bureau’s electronic filing system having the same contents and format as the DM/1 form) includes a field in the priority claim section to provide the WIPO access code. See **[MPEP §§ 2909](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ch2900_d24abb_27235_1dd.html)** and **[2909.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ch2900_d24abc_168f1_8d.html)**. Providing the WIPO access code in accordance with Administrative Instruction 408 will allow the USPTO to automatically attempt retrieval of the priority document via WIPO DAS in a nonprovisional international design application. If the USPTO is able to retrieve the priority document via WIPO DAS, the priority document will be considered to satisfy the requirement under **[37 CFR 1.55](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//plt_d0e319215.html)**  for a certified copy of the priority document. If the WIPO access code is not provided in accordance with Administrative Instruction 408, the WIPO access code may be provided to the USPTO by submitting in the nonprovisional international design application a corrected application data sheet (**[37 CFR 1.76(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//plt_d0e320348.html##aia_d0e320470)** ) and a request for a corrected filing receipt. Applicants are reminded that they continue to bear the ultimate responsibility for ensuring that the priority document is filed during the pendency of the application and before the patent is issued. Accordingly, applicants are encouraged to provide the WIPO access code to the USPTO as soon as possible and to check as necessary to confirm receipt by the USPTO of appropriate documents.

When making a foreign priority claim to an earlier filed international design application pursuant to **[35 U.S.C. 386(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//al_d225a2_27b56_2ab.html##al_d225a2_29a27_324)**  or **[(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//al_d225a2_27b56_2ab.html##al_d225a2_29a74_1f8)**  and **[37 CFR 1.55](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//plt_d0e319215.html)**, the USPTO will accept identification of the earlier international design application either by the application number assigned by the International Bureau or by its international registration number. Applicants should note, however, that on January 15, 2020, the International Bureau became a depositing office under WIPO DAS for international design applications and, to utilize WIPO DAS for retrieval of an international design application, the international design application must be identified by the application number in a specified format (i.e., WIPONNNNN or WIPONNNNNN (for electronic direct filings with the International Bureau), or NNNNNNNNN (for indirect filings or paper applications)). See Tip #5 on the Electronic Priority Document Exchange (PDX) Program site on **[www.uspto.gov/PatentsPDX/](https://www.uspto.gov/PatentsPDX)**. The USPTO site also includes information regarding the application number format for other types of foreign applications needed for retrieval via WIPO DAS.

# 2920.06    Allowance [R-01.2024]

A Notice of Allowability For a Design Application (form PTOL-37D) is used whenever a nonprovisional international design application has been placed in condition for allowance. See **[MPEP § 1302.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e131684.html)** for further information concerning the Notice of Allowability. In addition, a Notice of Allowance (form PTOL-85 (Hague)) is sent to the applicant requiring payment of the issue fee (i.e., second part of the U.S. designation fee). See **[37 CFR 1.311](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e326268.html)**  and **[1.18(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e315894.html##d0e315921)**. The Notice of Allowance and the Notice of Allowability are communicated to the applicant at the correspondence address of record in the application. The International Bureau is also notified of the communication of the Notice of Allowance to the applicant. In response to such notification, the International Bureau sends a courtesy notification to the holder regarding payment of the second part of the U.S. designation fee.

Since the Notice of Allowability is used whenever an application has been placed in a condition for allowance, the Notice of Allowability does not constitute a refusal of the effects of the international registration. However, a Notification of Partial Refusal (form PTO-2321) may be sent to the International Bureau concurrent with the sending of the Notice of Allowance to the applicant where all the designs contained in the international registration have not been allowed and were not previously the subject of a notification of refusal (e.g., all designs but the allowed design were removed by preliminary amendment prior to examination). See **[MPEP § 2920.05(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ch2900_d24abc_19742_1e1.html)** .

The issue fee specified in the Notice of Allowance form PTOL-85 (Hague) may be paid directly to the Office or through the International Bureau. An issue fee paid through the International Bureau shall be in the amount established in Swiss currency pursuant to Rule 28 as of the date of mailing of the notice of allowance. See **[37 CFR 1.18(b)(3)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e315894.html##ar_d2259d_1b229_24f)**. The International Bureau accepts payment only in Swiss currency (see Hague Agreement Rule 28(1)) and all fee amounts specified on the WIPO website are in Swiss currency). Further, the International Bureau will only accept payment in the amount corresponding to the entity status indicated in the Notice of Allowance. Any change in entity status from that shown in the Notice of Allowance must be communicated directly to the Office in accordance with U.S. rules, as instructed in the Notice of Allowance.

#### _Hague Rule 22_

#### _Corrections in the International Register_

- (1) [_Correction_]Where the International Bureau, acting ex officio or at the request of the holder, considers that there is an error concerning an international registration in the International Register, it shall modify the Register and inform the holder accordingly.
- (2) [_Refusal of Effects of Correction_] The Office of any designated Contracting Party shall have the right to declare in a notification to the International Bureau that it refuses to recognize the effects of the correction. Rules 18 to 19 shall apply mutatis mutandis.

#### _Hague Article 16_

#### _Recording of Changes and Other Matters Concerning International Registrations_

- (1) [Recording of Changes and Other Matters] The International Bureau shall, as prescribed, record in the International Register
    - (i) any change in ownership of the international registration, in respect of any or all of the designated Contracting Parties and in respect of any or all of the industrial designs that are the subject of the international registration, provided that the new owner is entitled to file an international application under Article 3,
    - (ii) any change in the name or address of the holder,
    - (iii) the appointment of a representative of the applicant or holder and any other relevant fact concerning such representative,
    - (iv) any renunciation, by the holder, of the international registration, in respect of any or all of the designated Contracting Parties,
    - (v) any limitation, by the holder, of the international registration, in respect of any or all of the designated Contracting Parties, to one or some of the industrial designs that are the subject of the international registration,
    - (vi) any invalidation, by the competent authorities of a designated Contracting Party, of the effects, in the territory of that Contracting Party, of the international registration in respect of any or all of the industrial designs that are the subject of the international registration,

- (2) [_Effect of Recording in International Register_] Any recording referred to in items (i), (ii), (iv), (v), (vi) and (vii) of paragraph (1) shall have the same effect as if it had been made in the Register of the Office of each of the Contracting Parties concerned, except that a Contracting Party may, in a declaration, notify the Director General that a recording referred to in item (i) of paragraph (1) shall not have that effect in that Contracting Party until the Office of that Contracting Party has received the statements or documents specified in that declaration.

#### _37 C.F.R. 1.1065  Corrections and other changes in the International Register._

- (a) The effects of any correction in the International Register by the International Bureau pursuant to Rule 22 in a pending nonprovisional international design application shall be decided by the Office in accordance with the merits of each situation, subject to such other requirements as may be imposed. A patent issuing from an international design application may only be corrected in accordance with the provisions of title 35, United States Code, for correcting patents. Any correction under Rule 22 recorded by the International Bureau with respect to an abandoned nonprovisional international design application will generally not be acted upon by the Office and shall not be given effect unless otherwise indicated by the Office.
- (b) A recording of a partial change in ownership in the International Register pursuant to Rule 21(7) concerning a transfer of less than all designs shall not have effect in the United States.

## I.    **CORRECTIONS UNDER HAGUE RULE 22**

Hague Agreement Rule 22 provides for correction of errors in the International Register by the International Bureau, acting ex officio, or at the request of the holder. Under Rule 22(2), a designated Contracting Party may refuse the effects of correction.

Upon receipt of a correction under Rule 22 in a pending application, the Office will make a determination whether to give effect to the correction or to refuse the effects of the correction in accordance with the merits of each situation, subject to such other requirements as may be imposed. Upon making such a determination, the Rule 22 correction will be annotated to reflect entry or non-entry of the correction. Where the Rule 22 correction is entered and corrects data contained in the official filing receipt, a corrected filing receipt will be issued.

Corrections under Rule 22 received in abandoned applications will generally not be acted upon by the Office and will not be given effect unless otherwise indicated by the Office. U.S. patents, including U.S. patents issuing from international design applications, may only be corrected in accordance with the provisions of title 35, United States Code, for correcting patents. Such provisions are contained, for example, in 35 U.S.C. chapter 25. See, e.g., **[MPEP §§ 1401](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e134632.html)**, **[1480](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e144743.html)** _et seq._ and **[1481](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//d0e144943.html)** _et seq._

## II.    **RECORDING OF CHANGES UNDER HAGUE ARTICLE 16**

Hague Agreement Article 16(1) provides for the recording of certain changes in the International Register by the International Bureau, including: (1) a change in ownership of the international registration; (2) a change in the name or address of the holder; (3) an appointment of a representative of the applicant or holder; (4) a renunciation of the international registration with respect to any or all of the designated Contracting Parties; (5) a limitation of the international registration with respect to any or all of the designated Contracting Parties, to one or some of the industrial designs that are the subject of the international registration; and (6) any invalidation by the competent authority of a designated Contracting Party of the effects of the international registration in the territory of that Contracting Party.

Regarding the recording of a change in ownership of the international registration pursuant to Article 16(1)(i), Article 16(2) provides that a Contracting Party may, in a declaration, notify the International Bureau that a recording of a change in ownership of the international registration shall not have that effect in that Contracting Party until the office of that Contracting Party has received the statements or documents specified in that declaration. The United States has made a declaration under Article 16(2). See **[MPEP § 2903](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ch2900_d24abb_193ad_e2.html)**. In addition, the recording of a partial change in ownership by the International Bureau in the International Register concerning a transfer of less than all designs shall not have effect in the United States. See **[37 CFR 1.1065(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d22557_20e2c_39b.html##ar_d2259d_210ba_3a9)**. **[Section 1.1065(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ar_d22557_20e2c_39b.html##ar_d2259d_210ba_3a9)**  does not limit the right of the owner to assign or otherwise transfer a portion of his or her interest in the application, or to record such transfer in the Office, but rather simply provides that the recording of such a transfer in the International Register will not have effect in the United States.

A change in the name or address of the holder under Article 16(1)(ii) will be entered in a pending nonprovisional international design application where the holder is the applicant and the change is timely made. See **[MPEP § 2920.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ch2900_d24abc_194c2_26.html)** regarding a change in the name of the applicant. Where the recording of a purported change in the name of the holder under Article 16(1)(ii) is a de facto change in the applicant, the Office will treat the recording as a recording under Article 16(1)(i).

The recording of the appointment of a representative of the applicant or holder pursuant to Article 16(1)(iii) concerns representation before the International Bureau pursuant to Rule 3. The recording under Article 16(1)(iii) does not effect a change in representation before the USPTO.

A renunciation of the international registration with respect to the designation of the United States pursuant to Article 16(1)(iv) will result in termination of a pending nonprovisional international design application. In such case, the Office will send a notification of abandonment to the applicant, or to the International Bureau in the form of a refusal where a refusal has not previously been communicated. See **[MPEP § 2920.05(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=ch2900_d24ad2_2793a_190.html#//ch2900_d24abc_19742_1e1.html)** .

The recording of a limitation with respect to the designation of the United States pursuant to Article 16(1)(v) will be treated as an amendment canceling the designs that are the subject of the limitation contained in the nonprovisional international design application.

No. 110-7, at 5 ("The proposed Act makes no substantive changes in U.S. design patent law with the exception of the following: the provision of limited rights to patent applicants between the date that their international design application is published by the International Bureau and the date on which they are granted a U.S. patent based on that application; the extension of a patent term for designs from fourteen to fifteen years from grant; and allowing the USPTO to use a published international design registration as a basis for rejecting a subsequently filed national patent application that is directed at the same or a similar subject matter.").

U.S. patents issued from international design applications shall be effective for a term of fifteen years from the date of grant. Payment of the fees referred to in Article 17 and Rule 24 for renewing an international registration ("renewal fees") is not required to maintain in force a U.S. patent issuing on an international design application.
