- (2) The provisions of paragraph (1) neither affect the application of the provisions of **[Article 7(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e362842.html#//d0e363156.html)**  nor preclude any national law from requiring, once the processing of the international application has started in the designated Office, the furnishing:
    - (i) when the applicant is a legal entity, of the name of an officer entitled to represent such legal entity.
    - (ii) of documents not part of the international application but which constitute proof of allegations or statements made in that application, including the confirmation of the international application by the signature of the applicant when that application, as filed, was signed by his representative or agent.

- (6) The national law may require that the applicant furnish evidence in respect of any substantive condition of patentability prescribed by such law.
- (7) Any receiving Office or, once the processing of the international application has started in the designated Office, that Office may apply the national law as far as it relates to any requirement that the applicant be represented by an agent having the right to represent applicants before the said Office and/or that the applicant have an address in the designated State for the purpose of receiving notifications.
- (8) Nothing in this Treaty and the Regulations is intended to be construed as limiting the freedom of any Contracting State to apply measures deemed necessary for the preservation of its national security or to limit, for the protection of the general economic interests of that State, the right of its own residents or nationals to file international applications.

- (2) If the language in which the international publication has been effected is different from the language in which publications under the national law are effected in the designated State, the said national law may provide that the effects provided for in paragraph (1) shall be applicable only from such time as:
    - (i) a translation into the latter language has been published as provided by the national law, or
    - (ii) a translation into the latter language has been made available to the public, by laying open for public inspection as provided by the national law, or

Such information or publication may, however, contain only the following data: identification of the receiving Office, name of the applicant, international filing date, international application number, and title of the invention.
    - (c) The provisions of subparagraph (a) shall not prevent any designated Office from allowing access to the international application for the purposes of the judicial authorities.

    - (a) If the International Preliminary Examining Authority considers
        - (i) that the international application relates to a subject matter on which the International Preliminary Examining Authority is not required, under the Regulations, to carry out an international preliminary examination, and in the particular case decides not to carry out such examination, or
        - (ii) that the description, the claims, or the drawings, are so unclear, or the claims are so inadequately supported by the description, that no meaningful opinion can be formed on the novelty, inventive step (non-obviousness), or industrial applicability, of the claimed invention, the said authority shall not go into the questions referred to in **[Article 33(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e362842.html#//d0e364085.html)**  and shall inform the applicant of this opinion and the reasons therefor.

    - (i) specify the technical field to which the invention relates;
    - (ii) indicate the background art which, as far as known to the applicant, can be regarded as useful for the understanding, searching and examination of the invention, and, preferably, cite the documents reflecting such art;
    - (iii) disclose the invention, as claimed, in such terms that the technical problem (even if not expressly stated as such) and its solution can be understood, and state the advantageous effects, if any, of the invention with reference to the background art;
    - (iv) briefly describe the figures in the drawings, if any;
    - (v) set forth at least the best mode contemplated by the applicant for carrying out the invention claimed; this shall be done in terms of examples, where appropriate, and with reference to the drawings, if any; where the national law of the designated State does not require the description of the best mode but is satisfied with the description of any mode (whether it is the best contemplated or not), failure to describe the best mode contemplated shall have no effect in that State;
    - (vi) indicate explicitly, when it is not obvious from the description or nature of the invention, the way in which the invention is capable of exploitation in industry and the way in which it can be made and used, or, if it can only be used, the way in which it can be used; the term "industry" is to be understood in its broadest sense as in the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property.
- (b) The manner and order specified in paragraph (a) shall be followed except when, because of the nature of the invention, a different manner or a different order would result in a better understanding and a more economic presentation.
- (c) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (b), each of the parts referred to in paragraph (a) shall preferably be preceded by an appropriate heading as suggested in the Administrative Instructions.

# 5.2    Nucleotide and/or Amino Acid Sequence Disclosure

In particular, they shall not rely on such references as: "as described in part ... of the description," or "as illustrated in figure ... of the drawings."
- (b) Where the international application contains drawings, the technical features mentioned in the claims shall preferably be followed by the reference signs relating to such features. When used, the reference signs shall preferably be placed between parentheses. If inclusion of reference signs does not particularly facilitate quicker understanding of a claim, it should not be made. Reference signs may be removed by a designated Office for the purposes of publication by such Office.

# 6.3    Manner of Claiming

- (a) The definition of the matter for which protection is sought shall be in terms of the technical features of the invention.

- (a) Any claim which includes all the features of one or more other claims (claim in dependent form, hereinafter referred to as "dependent claim") shall do so by a reference, if possible at the beginning, to the other claim or claims and shall then state the additional features claimed. Any dependent claim which refers to more than one other claim ("multiple dependent claim") shall refer to such claims in the alternative only. Multiple dependent claims shall not serve as a basis for any other multiple dependent claim. Where the national law of the national Office acting as International Searching Authority does not allow multiple dependent claims to be drafted in a manner different from that provided for in the preceding two sentences, failure to use that manner of claiming may result in an indication under **[Article 17(2)(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e362842.html#//d0e363501.html)**  in the international search report. Failure to use the said manner of claiming shall have no effect in a designated State if the manner of claiming actually used satisfies the national law of that State.
- (b) Any dependent claim shall be construed as including all the limitations contained in the claim to which it refers or, if the dependent claim is a multiple dependent claim, all the limitations contained in the particular claim in relation to which it is considered.

- (h-bis) The receiving Office shall, upon a reasoned request by the applicant or on its own decision, not transmit documents or parts thereof received in relation to the request under paragraph (a), if it finds that:
    
    - (i) this document or part thereof does not obviously serve the purpose of informing the public about the international application;
    - (ii) publication or public access to any such document or part thereof would clearly prejudice the personal or economic interests of any person; and
    - (iii) there is no prevailing public interest to have access to that document or part thereof.
    
    Where the receiving Office decides not to transmit documents or parts thereof to the International Bureau, it shall notify the International Bureau accordingly.

- (a) For the purposes of **[Article 15(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e362842.html#//d0e363418.html)**, relevant prior art shall consist of everything which has been made available to the public anywhere in the world by means of written disclosure (including drawings and other illustrations) and which is capable of being of assistance in determining that the claimed invention is or is not new and that it does or does not involve an inventive step (i.e., that it is or is not obvious), provided that the making available to the public occurred prior to the international filing date.
- (b) When any written disclosure refers to an oral disclosure, use, exhibition, or other means whereby the contents of the written disclosure were made available to the public, and such making available to the public occurred on a date prior to the international filing date, the international search report shall separately mention that fact and the date on which it occurred if the making available to the public of the written disclosure occurred on a date which is the same as, or later than, the international filing date.
- (c) Any published application or any patent whose publication date is the same as, or later than, but whose filing date, or, where applicable, claimed priority date, is earlier than the international filing date of the international application searched, and which would constitute relevant prior art for the purposes of **[Article 15(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e362842.html#//d0e363418.html)**  had it been published prior to the international filing date, shall be specially mentioned in the international search report.

# 33.2    Fields to Be Covered by the International Search

- (a) The international search shall cover all those technical fields, and shall be carried out on the basis of all those search files, which may contain material pertinent to the invention.
- (b) Consequently, not only shall the art in which the invention is classifiable be searched but also analogous arts regardless of where classified.
- (c) The question what arts are, in any given case, to be regarded as analogous shall be considered in the light of what appears to be the necessary essential function or use of the invention and not only the specific functions expressly indicated in the international application.
- (d) The international search shall embrace all subject matter that is generally recognized as equivalent to the subject matter of the claimed invention for all or certain of its features, even though, in its specifics, the invention as described in the international application is different.

# 33.3    Orientation of the International Search

- (a) International search shall be made on the basis of the claims, with due regard to the description and the drawings (if any) and with particular emphasis on the inventive concept towards which the claims are directed.
- (b) In so far as possible and reasonable, the international search shall cover the entire subject matter to which the claims are directed or to which they might reasonably be expected to be directed after they have been amended.

- (b) The documentation referred to in **[Article 15(4)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e362842.html#//d0e363418.html)**  ("minimum documentation") shall consist of:
    - (i) the "national patent documents" as specified in paragraph (c),
    - (ii) the published international (PCT) applications, the published regional applications for patents and inventors’ certificates, and the published regional patents and inventors’ certificates,
    - (iii) such other published items of non-patent literature as the International Searching Authorities shall agree upon and which shall be published in a list by the International Bureau when agreed upon for the first time and whenever changed.
- (c) Subject to paragraphs (d) and (e), the "national patent documents" shall be the following:
    - (i) the patents issued in and after 1920 by France, the former __Reichspatentamt__ of Germany, Japan, the former Soviet Union, Switzerland (in the French and German languages only), the United Kingdom, and the United States of America,
    - (ii) the patents issued by the Federal Republic of Germany, the People’s Republic of China, the Republic of Korea and the Russian Federation,
    - (iii) the patent applications, if any, published in and after 1920 in the countries referred to in items (i) and (ii),
    - (iv) the inventors’ certificates issued by the former Soviet Union,

- (d) Where an application is republished once (for example, an _Offenlegungsschrift_ as an _Auslegeschrift_) or more than once, no International Searching Authority shall be obliged to keep all versions in its documentation; consequently, each such Authority shall be entitled not to keep more than one version. Furthermore, where an application is granted and is issued in the form of a patent or a utility certificate (France), no International Searching Authority shall be obliged to keep both the application and the patent or utility certificate (France) in its documentation; consequently, each such Authority shall be entitled to keep either the application only or the patent or utility certificate (France) only.
- (e)  Any International Searching Authority whose official language, or one of whose official languages, is not Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Russian or Spanish is entitled not to include in its documentation those patent documents of the People's Republic of China, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation and the former Soviet Union as well as those patent documents in the Spanish language, respectively, for which no abstracts in the English language are generally available. English abstracts becoming generally available after the date of entry into force of these Regulations shall require the inclusion of the patent documents to which the abstracts refer no later than six months after such abstracts become generally available. In case of the interruption of abstracting services in English in technical fields in which English abstracts were formerly generally available, the Assembly shall take appropriate measures to provide for the prompt restoration of such services in the said fields.
- (f) For the purposes of this Rule, applications which have only been laid open for public inspection are not considered published applications.

# Rule 80 Computation of Time Limits

# 80.1    Periods Expressed in Years

When a period is expressed as one year or a certain number of years, computation shall start on the day following the day on which the relevant event occurred, and the period shall expire in the relevant subsequent year in the month having the same name and on the day having the same number as the month and the day on which the said event occurred, provided that if the relevant subsequent month has no day with the same number the period shall expire on the last day of that month.

# 80.2    Periods Expressed in Months

When a period is expressed as one month or a certain number of months, computation shall start on the day following the day on which the relevant event occurred, and the period shall expire in the relevant subsequent month on the day which has the same number as the day on which the said event occurred, provided that if the relevant subsequent month has no day with the same number the period shall expire on the last day of that month.

# 80.3    Periods Expressed in Days

When a period is expressed as a certain number of days, computation shall start on the day following the day on which the relevant event occurred, and the period shall expire on the day on which the last day of the count has been reached.

# 80.4    Local Dates

- (a) The date which is taken into consideration as the starting date of the computation of any period shall be the date which prevails in the locality at the time when the relevant event occurred.
- (b) The date on which any period expires shall be the date which prevails in the locality in which the required document must be filed or the required fee must be paid.

# 80.5    Expiration on a Non-Working Day or Official Holiday

If the expiration of any period during which any document or fee must reach a national Office or intergovernmental organization falls on a day:

- (i) on which such Office or organization is not open to the public for the purposes of the transaction of official business;
- (ii) on which ordinary mail is not delivered in the locality in which such Office or organization is situated;
- (iii) which, where such Office or organization is situated in more than one locality, is an official holiday in at least one of the localities in which such Office or organization is situated, and in circumstances where the national law applicable by that Office or organization provides, in respect of national applications, that, in such a case, such period shall expire on a subsequent day; or
