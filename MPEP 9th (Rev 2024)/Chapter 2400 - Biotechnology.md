# 2401    Introduction [R-01.2024]

This chapter provides guidance on the practices and procedures pertaining to the rules for deposits of biological materials for patent purposes (**[37 CFR 1.801](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333189.html)**  - **[1.809](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333576.html)** ) and the rules for the requirements for patent applications containing nucleotide sequence and/or amino acid sequence disclosures under World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Standard ST.25 (**[37 CFR 1.821](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html)**  - **[1.825](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e334511.html)** ) and WIPO Standard ST.26 (**[37 CFR 1.831](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1bdc8_2b8.html)**  - **[1.835](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1be4d_1f4.html)** ).

# 2402    The Deposit Rules [R-07.2015]

#### _37 C.F.R. 1.801   Biological material._

For the purposes of these regulations pertaining to the deposit of biological material for purposes of patents for inventions under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302376.html)**, the term biological material shall include material that is capable of self-replication either directly or indirectly. Representative examples include bacteria, fungi including yeast, algae, protozoa, eukaryotic cells, cell lines, hybridomas, plasmids, viruses, plant tissue cells, lichens and seeds. Viruses, vectors, cell organelles and other non-living material existing in and reproducible from a living cell may be deposited by deposit of the host cell capable of reproducing the non-living material.

Every patent must contain a written description of the invention sufficient to enable a person skilled in the art to which the invention pertains to make and use the invention. Where the invention involves a biological material and words alone cannot sufficiently describe how to make and use the invention in a reproducible manner, access to the biological material may be necessary for the satisfaction of the statutory requirements for patentability under **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302824.html)**. Courts have recognized the necessity and desirability of permitting an applicant for a patent to supplement the written disclosure in an application with a deposit of biological material which is essential to meet some requirement of the statute with respect to the claimed invention. See, e.g., _Ajinomoto Co. v. Archer-Daniels-Midland Co.,_ 228 F.3d 1338, 1345-46, 56 USPQ2d 1332, 1337-38 (Fed. Cir. 2000), _cert. denied,_ 121 S.Ct. 1957 (2001)(explaining how deposit may help satisfy enablement requirement); _Enzo Biochem, Inc. v. Gen-Probe, Inc.,_ 323 F.3d 956, 63 USPQ2d 1609 (Fed. Cir. 2002)(deposit may satisfy the written description requirement); _In re Argoudelis,_ 434 F.2d 666, 168 USPQ 99 (CCPA 1970). To facilitate the recognition of deposited biological material in patent applications throughout the world, the Budapest Treaty on the International Recognition of the Deposit of Microorganisms for the Purposes of Patent Procedure was established in 1977, and became operational in 1981. The Treaty requires signatory countries, like the United States, to recognize a deposit with any depository which has been approved by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).

The deposit rules (**[37 CFR 1.801](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333189.html)**  - **[1.809](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333576.html)** ) set forth examining procedures and conditions of deposit which must be satisfied in the event a deposit is required. The rules do not address the substantive issue of whether a deposit is required under any particular set of facts.

See **[PCT Rule 13bis](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e367637.html)**  and **[MPEP § 1823.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e168618.html)** for the requirements under the PCT for a reference to a deposited biological material in an international application.

# 2403    Deposit of Biological Material [R-07.2022]

**[37 CFR 1.801](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333189.html)**  indicates that the rules pertaining to deposits for purposes of patents for inventions under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302376.html)**  are intended to relate to biological material. For the purposes of these rules, the term "biological material" is defined in terms of a non-exhaustive list of representative materials which can be deposited in accordance with the procedures defined in these rules. These rules are intended to address procedural matters in the deposit of biological material for patent purposes. They are not designed to decide substantive issues such as whether a deposit of a particular organism or material would be recognized or necessary for the purposes of satisfying the statutory requirements for patentability under **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302824.html)**. The issue of the need to make a deposit of biological material typically arises under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**  with regard to the enablement requirement, although the issue may also arise under the written description or best mode requirement of the statute. Deposit issues may also arise under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)**  with respect to the claims.

**[37 CFR 1.801](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333189.html)**  does not attempt to identify what biological material either needs to be or may be deposited to comply with the requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302824.html)**. For the most part, this issue must be addressed on a case-by-case basis. Thus, while the Office does not currently contemplate that there would be any situations where a material that is not capable of self-replication either directly or indirectly would be acceptable as a deposit, an applicant is clearly not precluded by these rules from attempting to show in any given application why the deposit of such a material should be acceptable to satisfy the requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302824.html)**. The examiner is cautioned against requiring that a specific biological material be deposited where the applicant can show that a deposit of starting material that is currently not available to the public would allow the skilled artisan to make and use the claimed invention. For example, where a claimed invention is drawn to a plant having novel properties produced by the insertion of a proprietary gene at a specific locus, the plant per se need not be deposited if deposit of a vector or hybridoma containing the gene would enable one of ordinary skill in the art to make and use the claimed invention without undue experimentation.

# 2403.01    Material Capable of Self- Replication [R-08.2012]

Biological material includes material that is capable of self-replication either directly or indirectly. Direct self-replication includes those situations where the biological material reproduces by itself. Representative examples of materials capable of self-replication are defined in the rule. Indirect self-replication is meant to include those situations where the biological material is only capable of replication when another self-replicating biological material is present. Self-replication after insertion in a host is one example of indirect self-replication. Examples of indirect replicating biological materials include viruses, phages, plasmids, symbionts, and replication defective cells. The list of representative examples of each type of replicating material includes viruses to demonstrate that the two lists in the rule are not intended to be mutually exclusive.

# 2403.02    Plant Material [R-10.2019]

Although plant material is included within the scope of the definition of biological material for purposes of patents for plant inventions under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302376.html)**, the rules on deposits are not applicable to applications filed under the Plant Patent Act (**[35 U.S.C. 161](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e304416.html)** -**[164](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e304454.html)** ). The Office is of the view that a deposit is not required under the present provisions of **[35 U.S.C. 162](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e304430.html)**. Thus, a deposit is not necessary for the grant of a plant patent under the provisions of **[35 U.S.C. 161](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e304416.html)** -**[164](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e304454.html)**. See also **[MPEP § 1605](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e161481.html)**. As with other biological material deposited for purposes of patents for inventions under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302376.html)**, the deposit of plant material together with the written specification must enable those skilled in the art to make and use the claimed invention, in accordance with the requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302824.html)**.

As with some types of reproducible biological material, seeds can be reproduced only after a growing season which may be relatively long. Although the rules do not specify a specific number of seeds to be deposited to meet the requirements of these rules, so long as the number of seeds deposited complies with the requirements of the Budapest Treaty International Depositary Authority (IDA) where the deposit is made, the USPTO would consider such a compliant submission as satisfying the rules under **[37 CFR 1.801](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333189.html)**  through **[1.809](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333576.html)**. Note that the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), a Budapest IDA, requires a minimum deposit of 625 seeds; other IDAs may have different minimum requirements. Accordingly, any depositor should confirm that the number submitted to a specific IDA complies with that IDA's requirements for seed deposits.

# 2404    Need or Opportunity to Make a Deposit [R-08.2012]

#### _37 C.F.R. 1.802   Need or opportunity to make a deposit._

- (a) Where an invention is, or relies on, a biological material, the disclosure may include reference to a deposit of such biological material.
- (b) Biological material need not be deposited unless access to such material is necessary for the satisfaction of the statutory requirements for patentability under **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302824.html)**. If a deposit is necessary, it shall be acceptable if made in accordance with these regulations. Biological material need not be deposited, _inter alia,_ if it is known and readily available to the public or can be made or isolated without undue experimentation. Once deposited in a depository complying with these regulations, a biological material will be considered to be readily available even though some requirement of law or regulation of the United States or of the country in which the depository institution is located permits access to the material only under conditions imposed for safety, public health or similar reasons.
- (c) The reference to a biological material in a specification disclosure or the actual deposit of such material by an applicant or patent owner does not create any presumption that such material is necessary to satisfy **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302824.html)**  or that deposit in accordance with these regulations is or was required.

**[37 CFR 1.802(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333205.html)**  permits a deposit of a biological material to be referenced in a patent application where an invention is, or relies on, a biological material. The invention may rely on a biological material for the purposes of making or using the invention, either as a preferred mode or an alternative mode of operation. A reference to a deposit may be included in a specification even though the deposit is not required to satisfy the requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302824.html)**.

There is no necessary implication or presumption that can or should be made about the need for a deposit simply because reference to a deposit is made in an application disclosure, as noted in paragraph (c). As noted in paragraph (b), biological material need not be deposited unless access to such material is necessary for the satisfaction of the statutory requirements for patentability under **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302824.html)**  and that access is not otherwise available in the absence of a deposit. Where a deposit is required to provide the necessary access, a deposit is acceptable for patent purposes only where it is made in accordance with these regulations. Even where access to biological material is required to satisfy these statutory requirements, a deposit may not be necessary if access sufficient to satisfy these requirements is otherwise available.

# 2404.01    Biological Material That Is Known and Readily Available to the Public [R-07.2015]

In an application where the invention required access to specific biological material, an applicant could show that the biological material is accessible because it is known and readily available to the public. The concepts of "known and readily available" are considered to reflect a level of public accessibility to a necessary component of an invention disclosure that is consistent with an ability to make and use the invention. To avoid the need for a deposit on this basis, the biological material must be both known and readily available - neither concept alone is sufficient. A material may be known in the sense that its existence has been published, but is not available to those who wish to obtain that particular known biological material. Likewise, a biological material may be available in the sense that those having possession of it would make it available upon request, but no one has been informed of its existence.

The Board has held that a description of the precise geographic location of marine tunicates, as a biological material, used in a claimed invention was adequate to satisfy the enablement requirement of **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302824.html)**. See _Ex Parte Rinehart,_ 10 USPQ2d 1719 (Bd. Pat. App. & Int. 1985). The term "readily" used in the phrase "known and readily available" is considered appropriate to define that degree of availability which would be reasonable under the circumstances. If the biological material and its natural location can be adequately described so that one skilled in the art could obtain it using ordinary skill in the art, the disclosure would appear to be sufficient to meet the enablement requirement of **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302824.html)**  without a deposit so long as its degree of availability is reasonable under the circumstances.

By showing that a biological material is known and readily available or by making a deposit in accordance with these rules, applicant does not guarantee that such biological material will be available forever. Public access during the term of the patent may affect the enforceability of the patent. Although there is a public interest in the availability of a deposited biological material during and after the period of enforceability of the patent, there should not be any undue concern about continued access to the public. See **[37 CFR 1.806](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333444.html)**  (the term of deposit is "at least thirty (30) years and at least five (5) years after the most recent request" for a sample; the agreement sufficiently ensures that the deposit will be "available beyond the enforceable life of the patent"). Unless there is a reasonable basis to believe that the biological material will cease to be available during the enforceable life of the patent, current availability would satisfy the requirement. The incentives provided by the patent system should not be constrained by the mere possibility that a disclosure that was once enabling would become non-enabling over a period of time through no fault of the patentee. _In re Metcalfe,_ 410 F.2d 1378, 161 USPQ 789 (CCPA 1969).

If an applicant has adequately established that a biological material is known and readily available, the Office will accept that showing. In those instances, however, the applicant takes the risk that the material may cease to be known and readily available. Such a defect cannot be cured by reissue after the grant of a patent.

On the other hand, _Ex parte Humphreys,_ 24 USPQ2d 1255 (Bd. Pat. App. & Int. 1992), held that the only manner in which applicants could satisfy their burden of assuring public access to the needed biological material, and, thereby, compliance with the enablement requirement of **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302824.html)**, was by making an appropriate deposit. The fact that applicants and other members of the public were able to obtain the material in question from a given depository prior to and after the filing date of the application in issue did not establish that upon issuance of a patent on the application that such material would continue to be accessible to the public. The applicants did not make of record any of the facts and circumstances surrounding their access to the material in issue from the depository, nor was there any evidence as to the depository’s policy regarding the material if a patent would have been granted. Further, there was no assurance that the depository would have allowed unlimited access to the material if the application had matured into a patent.

There are many factors that may be used as indicia that a biological material is known and readily available to the public. Relevant factors include commercial availability, references to the biological material in printed publications, declarations of accessibility by those working in the field, evidence of predictable isolation techniques, or an existing deposit made in accordance with these rules. Each factor alone may or may not be sufficient to demonstrate that the biological material is known and readily available. Those applicants that rely on evidence of accessibility other than a deposit take the risk that the patent may no longer be enforceable if the biological material necessary to satisfy the requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302824.html)**  ceases to be accessible.

The Office will accept commercial availability as evidence that a biological material is known and readily available only when the evidence is clear and convincing that the public has access to the material. See the final rule entitled "_Deposit of Biological Materials for Patent Purposes,_" 54 FR 34864, 34875 (August 22, 1989). A product could be commercially available but only at a price that effectively eliminates accessibility to those desiring to obtain a sample. The relationship between the applicant relying on a biological material and the commercial supplier is one factor that would be considered in determining whether the biological material was known and readily available. However, the mere fact that the biological material is commercially available only through the patent holder or the patent holder’s agents or assigns shall not, by itself, justify a finding that the necessary material is not readily available, absent reason to believe that access to the biological material would later be improperly restricted.

The mere reference to a deposit or the biological material itself in any document or publication does not necessarily mean that the deposited biological material is readily available. Even a deposit made under the Budapest Treaty and referenced in a United States or foreign patent document would not necessarily meet the test for known and readily available unless the deposit was made under conditions that are consistent with those specified in these rules, including the provision that requires, with one possible exception (**[37 CFR 1.808(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333511.html)** ), that all restrictions on the accessibility be irrevocably removed by the applicant upon the granting of the patent. _Ex parte Hildebrand,_ 15 USPQ2d 1662 (Bd. Pat. App. & Int. 1990).

A deposit of biological material cited in a U.S. patent need not be made available if it was not required to satisfy **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302824.html)**. For this reason, **[37 CFR 1.808(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333511.html)**  provides that upon request made to the Office, the Office will certify whether a deposit has been stated to have been made under conditions which make it available to the public as of the issue date. See **[37 CFR 1.808(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333511.html)**  and **[MPEP § 2410.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e242206.html)** for the requirements of the request. The Office will not certify that the aforementioned statement has been made unless:

- (A) the deposit was necessary to overcome a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302824.html)**,
- (B) there is, in the record, a statement by the examiner that a rejection would have been made "but for" the deposit (assumes deposit information in record, as filed),
- (C) the record otherwise clearly indicates that the deposit was made under Budapest Treaty, and that all restrictions imposed by the depositor on the availability to the public of the deposited material will be irrevocably removed upon the granting of the patent (with the possible exception of requiring the request for the deposit to be in the format specified in **[37 CFR 1.808(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333511.html)** ), or
- (D) the record otherwise clearly indicates that an acceptable non-Budapest Treaty deposit was made and that all restrictions imposed by the depositor on the availability to the public of the deposited material will be irrevocably removed upon the granting of the patent (with the possible exception of requiring the request for the deposit to be in the format specified in **[37 CFR 1.808(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333511.html##d0e333537)** ).

If a deposit is not made under the conditions set forth in **[37 CFR 1.808(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333511.html)**, the deposit cannot be relied upon for other purposes, e.g., the deposit cannot be relied upon by a third party to establish "known" and "readily available" in another application. See **[37 CFR 1.808](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333511.html)**  and **[MPEP § 2410](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e242094.html)** and **[§ 2410.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e242206.html)**.

Once a deposit is made in a depository complying with these rules, and under conditions complying with these rules, a biological material will be considered to be readily available even though some requirement of law or regulation in the United States or in the country where the depository institution is located permits access to the material only under conditions imposed for health, safety or similar reasons. This provision is consistent with the Budapest Treaty (Article 5) and is designed to permit the patenting of inventions involving materials having restricted distribution, where the restrictions are imposed for the public, as opposed to the private, welfare.

# 2404.02    Biological Material That Can Be Made or Isolated Without Undue Experimentation [R-08.2012]

Applicant may show that a deposit is not necessary even though specific biological materials are required to practice the invention if those biological materials can be made or isolated without undue experimentation. Deposits may be required to support the claims if an isolation procedure requires undue experimentation to obtain the desired biological material. _Ex Parte Jackson,_ 217 USPQ 804 (Bd. App. 1982). No deposit is required, however, where the required biological materials can be obtained from publicly available material with only routine experimentation and a reliable screening test. _Tabuchi v. Nubel,_ 559 F.2d 1183, 194 USPQ 521 (CCPA 1977); _Ex Parte Hata,_ 6 USPQ2d 1652 (Bd. Pat. App. & Int. 1987).

# 2404.03    Reference to a Deposit in the Specification [R-08.2012]

**[37 CFR 1.802(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333205.html)**  specifically provides that the mere reference to a biological material in the specification disclosure or the actual deposit of such material does not create any presumption that such referenced or deposited material is necessary to satisfy **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302824.html)**, or that a deposit in accordance with these regulations is or was required. It should be noted, however, that a reference to a biological material, present in an application upon filing, may form the basis for making a deposit, where required, after the filing date of a given application but that the reference to the biological material, itself, cannot be added after filing without risking the prohibited introduction of new matter (**[35 U.S.C. 132](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e303187.html)** ). See the discussion of the Lundak application in **[MPEP § 2406.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e241742.html)**.

# 2405    Acceptable Depository [R-07.2015]

#### _37 C.F.R. 1.803   Acceptable depository._

- (a) A deposit shall be recognized for the purposes of these regulations if made in
    - (1) any International Depositary Authority (IDA) as established under the Budapest Treaty on the International Recognition of the Deposit of Microorganisms for the Purposes of Patent Procedure, or
    - (2) any other depository recognized to be suitable by the Office. Suitability will be determined by the Commissioner on the basis of the administrative and technical competence, and agreement of the depository to comply with the terms and conditions applicable to deposits for patent purposes. The Commissioner may seek the advice of impartial consultants on the suitability of a depository. The depository must:
        - (i) Have a continuous existence;
        - (ii) Exist independent of the control of the depositor;
        - (iii) Possess the staff and facilities sufficient to examine the viability of a deposit and store the deposit in a manner which ensures that it is kept viable and uncontaminated;
        - (iv) Provide for sufficient safety measures to minimize the risk of losing biological material deposited with it;
        - (v) Be impartial and objective;
        - (vi) Furnish samples of the deposited material in an expeditious and proper manner; and
        - (vii) Promptly notify depositors of its inability to furnish samples, and the reasons why.
- (b) A depository seeking status under paragraph (a)(2) of this section must direct a communication to the Commissioner which shall:
    - (1) Indicate the name and address of the depository to which the communication relates;
    - (2) Contain detailed information as to the capacity of the depository to comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) (2) of this section, including information on its legal status, scientific standing, staff and facilities;
    - (3) Indicate that the depository intends to be available, for the purposes of deposit, to any depositor under these same conditions;
    - (4) Where the depository intends to accept for deposit only certain kinds of biological material, specify such kinds;
    - (5) Indicate the amount of any fees that the depository will, upon acquiring the status of suitable depository under paragraph (a) (2) of this section, charge for storage, viability statements and furnishings of samples of the deposit.
- (c) A depository having status under paragraph (a)(2) of this section limited to certain kinds of biological material may extend such status to additional kinds of biological material by directing a communication to the Commissioner in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section. If a previous communication under paragraph (b) of this section is of record, items in common with the previous communication may be incorporated by reference.
- (d) Once a depository is recognized to be suitable by the Commissioner or has defaulted or discontinued its performance under this section, notice thereof will be published in the Official Gazette of the Patent and Trademark Office.

**[37 CFR 1.803](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333237.html)**  indicates that a depository will be recognized as acceptable for the purposes of these regulations if it is either an International Depositary Authority (IDA) established under the Budapest Treaty, or if it is a depository recognized as suitable by the Commissioner. After the effective date of these regulations, a deposit of biological material which is made in a depository which is not recognized as acceptable under this regulation will not be considered as satisfying the requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302824.html)**. See _Ex parte Humphreys,_ 24 USPQ2d 1255 (Bd. Pat. App. & Int. 1992). On the other hand, if a deposit is not required to satisfy the requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302824.html)**, it is permissible to make reference to such a deposit even though it may not be in a depository or made under the conditions which are acceptable under these regulations. As new depositories are recognized as suitable by the Commissioner, their identity will be announced in the _Official Gazette._

An organization may be recognized as suitable by the Office if the procedure and conditions specified in **[37 CFR 1.803(a)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333237.html)**  and **[37 CFR 1.803(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333237.html)**  are followed. Generally, it is not the intention of the Office to recognize as suitable any organization where the need for a suitable depository for patent purposes is being met by depositories recognized as IDAs under the Budapest Treaty. Suitability will be judged by the Commissioner, based on need and the information supplied by the organization seeking status, and information obtained from other sources that may be consulted.

While there is a desire to provide flexibility to a patent applicant in selecting an appropriate depository, these rules are not intended to permit each patent applicant to become its own depository since both the patent owner and the public have an interest in the continued availability and accessibility of the deposit during the enforceable life of the patent, and the public has a continuing interest in its availability when the patent is no longer enforceable. The concept of a depository independent of the control of the depositor or an IDA as an acceptable depository is based on the need and desire to ensure the safe and reliable storage of a deposited biological material under circumstances that are substantially free of the opportunity for intentional mishandling or negligent handling of the deposited material. The use of an independent depository or internationally recognized depository will tend to preserve the integrity of the deposit process against those that may accidentally alter the deposited material, may wish to tamper with the deposited material or may wish to resume control of its availability when the patent is no longer enforceable, and will tend to preserve the interest of the public in the access to the biological material once the term of the patent expires.

When a depository having status under **[37 CFR 1.803(a)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333237.html)**  seeks to change the kinds of biological materials that it will accept and maintain for the purposes of these rules, a communication requesting such a change should be directed to the Commissioner containing the information requested in **[37 CFR 1.803(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333237.html)**. When such a change is requested, the requesting depository should provide a complete list of the kinds of biological materials it will accept.

**[37 CFR 1.803(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333237.html)**  indicates that once a depository is recognized as suitable for the purposes of this rule, or has defaulted or discontinued its performance under this section, notice thereof will be published in the _Official Gazette_ of the Patent and Trademark Office. The mere fact that a deposit has been made in an IDA recognized under the Budapest Treaty does not mean that the terms of the deposit meet either the requirements of the Budapest Treaty or the deposit regulations. Many of the depositories recognized under the Budapest Treaty have many different arrangements under which biological material may be stored.

The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) publishes a Guide to the Deposit of Micro-organisms under the Budapest Treaty (WIPO Publication No. 661 (E)) on the procedures and requirements concerning the deposit of biological material, including procedures for obtaining a sample of deposited material, in each of the international depository authorities. The Guide and a list of current IDAs under the Budapest Treaty are available at **[www.wipo.int/treaties/en/registration/budapest/](http://www.wipo.int/treaties/en/registration/budapest/)**.

# 2406    Time of Making an Original Deposit [R-07.2015]

#### _37 C.F.R. 1.804   Time of making an original deposit._

- (a) Whenever a biological material is specifically identified in an application for patent as filed, an original deposit thereof may be made at any time before filing the application for patent or, subject to **[§ 1.809](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333576.html)**, during pendency of the application for patent.
- (b) When the original deposit is made after the effective filing date of an application for patent, the applicant must promptly submit a statement from a person in a position to corroborate the fact, stating that the biological material which is deposited is a biological material specifically identified in the application as filed.

**[37 CFR 1.804](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333323.html)**  specifies the time for making an original deposit to fulfill the requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302824.html)**. For the reasons discussed throughout this section, it is recommended that a deposit be made before the filing date of the application. However, for the purposes of complying with the requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302824.html)**, a deposit of a biological material may be made at any time before filing the application for patent or during the pendency of the application subject to the conditions of **[37 CFR 1.809](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333576.html)**. Where a deposit is needed to satisfy the requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302824.html)**  and it is made during the pendency of the application, it must be made no later than the time period set by the examiner at the time the Notice of Allowance and Issue Fee Due is mailed. However, a necessary deposit need not be made by an applicant until the application is in condition for allowance so long as the applicant provides a written assurance that an acceptable deposit will be made on or before the payment of the issue fee. This written assurance must provide sufficiently detailed information to convince the examiner that there is no outstanding issue regarding deposits that needs to be resolved. Note that while **[37 CFR 1.804](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333323.html)**  permits making a deposit after the filing date of an application, in many countries the deposit must be made before the filing date of the application. See **[MPEP § 2406.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e241779.html)**.

Insofar as the rules do not permit post-issuance original deposits, the failure to make an original deposit in an application cannot be cured by filing a reissue application or instituting a reexamination proceeding. However, if an amendment of claims in a reexamination proceeding raises the need for a deposit, an original deposit may be made during the reexamination proceeding.

# 2406.01    Description in Application Specification [R-07.2015]

**[37 CFR 1.804(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333323.html)**  specifies not only a permissible time frame for making an original deposit, but also specifies that the biological material deposited must be specifically identified in the application for patent as filed. The requirement for a specific identification is consistent with the description requirement of **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302824.html)**  and provides an antecedent basis for the biological material which either has been or will be deposited before the patent is granted.

The description in the Lundak application as filed (now U.S. Patent No. 4,594,325) provides a suitable illustration of the specific identification and description which are required in an application as filed. In that application, an immortal B-cell line was disclosed and claimed. The cell line was referred to in the application, as filed, as WI-L2-729 HF2. The methods of obtaining and using this cell line were also described in the application as filed. A deposit of the cell line was made with the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) about a week after the application was filed in the United States. The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that the requirements of access by the Office to a sample of the cell line during pendency, and public access after grant, were met by Lundak's procedures. The Court further held that the addition of information designating the depository, accession number, and deposit date of the deposited cell line in ATCC after the filing date did not violate the prohibition against new matter in **[35 U.S.C. 132](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e303187.html)**. _In re Lundak,_ 773 F.2d 1216, 227 USPQ 90 (Fed. Cir. 1985). However, it must be clear from the application as filed that the invention claimed and described in the specification "was fully capable of being reduced to practice (i.e., no technological problems, the resolution of which would require more than ordinary skill and reasonable time, remained in order to obtain an operative, useful process)." _Feldman v. Aunstrup,_ 517 F.2d 1351, 1355, 186 USPQ 108, 113 (CCPA 1975), _cert. denied,_ 424 U.S. 912 (1976).

# 2406.02    Deposit After Filing Date - Corroboration [R-08.2012]

When the original deposit is made after the effective filing date of an application for patent, an applicant is required to promptly submit a statement from a person in a position to corroborate that the biological material which is deposited is a biological material specifically identified in the application (the filing date of which is relied upon) as filed. The nature of this corroboration will depend on the circumstances in the particular application under consideration, including the length of time between the application filing date and the date of deposit. While few, if any, situations can be imagined where the description requirement of **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302824.html)**  can be satisfied where the biological material was not in existence at the time of filing, the rules will not preclude such a situation as there is no requirement in the patent law that an actual reduction to practice occur as a condition precedent to filing a patent application.

# 2406.03    Possible Loss of U.S. Filing Date in Other Countries [R-07.2015]

Those applicants intending to file patent applications in a country other than the United States relying upon biological material that must be deposited to satisfy the requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302824.html)**  when the application is filed in the United States are cautioned that in many countries the deposit must be made before the filing date of the priority application in order to obtain foreign priority rights. Thus, while the deposit of a biological material subsequent to the effective filing date of a United States application may be relied upon to comply with **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302824.html)**, an applicant may not be able to rely on the filing date of such a U.S. application if a patent is sought in certain countries other than the United States.

# 2407    Replacement or Supplement of Deposit [R-08.2012]

#### _37 C.F.R. 1.805   Replacement or supplement of deposit._

- (a) A depositor, after receiving notice during the pendency of an application for patent, application for reissue patent or reexamination proceeding, that the depository possessing a deposit either cannot furnish samples thereof or can furnish samples thereof but the deposit has become contaminated or has lost its capability to function as described in the specification, shall notify the Office in writing, in each application for patent or patent affected. In such a case, or where the Office otherwise learns, during the pendency of an application for patent, application for reissue patent or reexamination proceeding, that the depository possessing a deposit either cannot furnish samples thereof or can furnish samples thereof but the deposit has become contaminated or has lost its capability to function as described in the specification, the need for making a replacement or supplemental deposit will be governed by the same considerations governing the need for making an original deposit under the provisions set forth in **[§ 1.802(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333205.html)**. A replacement or supplemental deposit made during the pendency of an application for patent shall not be accepted unless it meets the requirements for making an original deposit under these regulations, including the requirement set forth under **[§ 1.804(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333323.html)**. A replacement or supplemental deposit made in connection with a patent, whether or not made during the pendency of an application for reissue patent or a reexamination proceeding or both, shall not be accepted unless a certificate of correction under **[§ 1.323](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e326640.html)**  is requested by the patent owner which meets the terms of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.
- (b) A request for certificate of correction under this section shall not be granted unless the certificate identifies:
    - (1) The accession number for the replacement or supplemental deposit;
    - (2) The date of the deposit; and
    - (3) The name and address of the depository.
- (c) A request for a certificate of correction under this section shall not be granted unless the request is made promptly after the replacement or supplemental deposit has been made and the request:
    - (1) Includes a statement of the reason for making the replacement or supplemental deposit;
    - (2) Includes a statement from a person in a position to corroborate the fact, and stating that the replacement or supplemental deposit is of a biological material which is identical to that originally deposited;
    - (3) Includes a showing that the patent owner acted diligently —
        - (i) In the case of a replacement deposit, in making the deposit after receiving notice that samples could no longer be furnished from an earlier deposit; or
        - (ii) In the case of a supplemental deposit, in making the deposit after receiving notice that the earlier deposit had become contaminated or had lost its capability to function as described in the specification;
    - (4) Includes a statement that the term of the replacement or supplemental deposit expires no earlier than the term of the deposit being replaced or supplemented; and
    - (5) Otherwise establishes compliance with these regulations.
- (d) A depositor’s failure to replace a deposit, or in the case of a patent, to diligently replace a deposit and promptly thereafter request a certificate of correction which meets the terms of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, after being notified that the depository possessing the deposit cannot furnish samples thereof, shall cause the application or patent involved to be treated in any Office proceeding as if no deposit were made.
- (e) In the event a deposit is replaced according to these regulations, the Office will apply a rebuttable presumption of identity between the original and the replacement deposit where a patent making reference to the deposit is relied upon during any Office proceeding.
- (f) A replacement or supplemental deposit made during the pendency of an application for patent may be made for any reason.
- (g) In no case is a replacement or supplemental deposit of a biological material necessary where the biological material, in accordance with **[§ 1.802(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333205.html)**, need not be deposited.
- (h) No replacement deposit of a biological material is necessary where a depository can furnish samples thereof but the depository for national security, health or environmental safety reasons is unable to provide samples to requesters outside of the jurisdiction where the depository is located.
- (i) The Office will not recognize in any Office proceeding a replacement deposit of a biological material made by a patent owner where the depository could furnish samples of the deposit being replaced.

**[37 CFR 1.805](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333345.html)**  relates to the deposit of a biological material to replace or supplement a previous deposit. The term "replacement" is directed to those situations where one deposit is being substituted for another. An applicant may have greater latitude in replacing a deposit during the pendency of an application than after the patent is granted. Replacement will typically take place where the earlier deposit is no longer viable. The term "supplement" is directed to those situations where the earlier deposit is still viable in the sense that it is alive and capable of replication either directly or indirectly, but has lost a quality (e.g., purity, functionality) it allegedly possessed at the time the application was filed.

# 2407.01    In a Pending Application [R-07.2015]

Pursuant to **[37 CFR 1.805(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333345.html##d0e333353)**, an applicant is required to notify the Office when it obtains information that the depository possessing a deposit referenced in an application cannot furnish samples of the deposit. When the Office is so informed or otherwise becomes aware that samples of the deposited material cannot be furnished by the depository, the examiner will treat the application as if no deposit existed. A replacement or supplemental deposit must be made if access to the deposited material is necessary to satisfy the requirements for patentability under **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302824912.html)**. A replacement or supplemental deposit will be accepted if it meets all the requirements for making an original deposit.

It should be noted that in a pending application, an applicant need not replace the identical material previously deposited, but may make an original deposit of a biological material which is specifically identified and described in the application as filed. Whether this alternative deposit will meet the requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302824.html)**  with respect to the claimed subject matter must be resolved by the examiner on a case-by-case basis. The conditions in **[37 CFR 1.802(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333205.html)**  and **[37 CFR 1.804(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333323.html)**  must be satisfied.

# 2407.02    After a Patent Has Issued [R-07.2015]

A patent owner is required to notify the Office when it obtains information that a depository possessing a deposit referenced in a patent cannot furnish samples of the deposit. Failure to diligently replace the deposit and promptly thereafter request a certificate of correction which meets the terms of **[37 CFR 1.805(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333345.html##d0e333366)**  and **[37 CFR 1.805(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333345.html##d0e333382)**  will cause the patent involved to be treated in any Office proceeding as if no deposit were made.

A replacement or supplemental deposit made in connection with a patent, whether or not made during the pendency of an application for reissue patent or a reexamination proceeding or both, shall not be accepted unless a certificate of correction under **[37 CFR 1.323](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e326640.html)**  is requested which meets the terms of **[37 CFR 1.805(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333345.html##d0e333366)**  and **[37 CFR 1.805(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333345.html##d0e333382)**  for replacement or supplemental deposits. See **[MPEP § 1411.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e136500.html)** for including changes that were made by a certificate of correction to the original patent grant in a reissue application, and **[MPEP § 2219](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e223163.html)** for including a copy of any certificate of correction to the original patent grant as part of a request for _ex parte_ reexamination.

**[37 CFR 1.805(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333345.html)**  and **[37 CFR 1.805(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333345.html)**  specify the procedures that a patent owner may follow to ensure that a patent contains the appropriate information about a deposited biological material in the event that a replacement or supplemental deposit is made after the patent is granted. **[37 CFR 1.805(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333345.html)**  describes the information which must be contained in the certificate of correction, whereas **[37 CFR 1.805(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333345.html)**  describes the information which must be provided in the request to make the correction.

A request for a certificate of correction of a patent under **[37 CFR 1.805(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333345.html##d0e333366)**  and **[37 CFR 1.805(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333345.html##d0e333382)**  will not be granted where no original deposit was made before or during the pendency of the application which matured into the patent. A patent defective because of lack of a necessary deposit is necessarily fatally defective for failure to comply with the first paragraph of **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302824912.html)**.

# 2407.03    Failure to Replace [R-08.2012]

**[37 CFR 1.805(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333345.html)**  sets forth the Office position that the failure to make a replacement deposit in a case pending before the Office, for example a reissue or reexamination proceeding, where a deposit is considered to be necessary to satisfy the requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302824.html)**, shall cause the application or patent involved to be treated in any Office proceeding as if no deposit were made. The provisions of **[37 CFR 1.805(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333345.html)**  indicate that a replacement need not be made where, at the point in time when replacement would otherwise be necessary, access to the necessary biological material was otherwise available. For example, a replacement deposit would not be required under the circumstances where access to the necessary biological material was established through commercial suppliers.

# 2407.04    Treatment of Replacement [R-08.2012]

**[37 CFR 1.805(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333345.html)**  indicates that the Office will apply a rebuttable presumption of identity between the replacement deposit and an original deposit where a patent making reference to the deposit is relied on during any Office proceeding. This means that where a replacement deposit is permitted and made, the examiner will assume that the same material as described in the patent is accessible from the identified depository unless evidence to the contrary comes to the attention of the Office.

An applicant for patent may make a replacement deposit during the pendency of the application for any reason. The provisions of **[37 CFR 1.805(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333345.html)**  recognize that since an original deposit may be made during the pendency of the application subject to the conditions of **[37 CFR 1.809](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333576.html)**, a replacement deposit logically cannot be held to any higher standard or any further requirements.

# 2407.05    Exemption From Replacement [R-08.2012]

The provisions of **[37 CFR 1.805(h)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333345.html)**  indicate that a replacement deposit is not required even though the depository cannot furnish samples, under certain conditions, to those requesting a sample outside of the jurisdiction where the depository is located. The conditions are specified in this paragraph as being limited to national security, health or environmental safety reasons. See also Article 5 of the Budapest Treaty.

# 2407.06    Replacement May Not Be Recognized [R-07.2015]

**[37 CFR 1.805(i)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333345.html)**  indicates that the Office will not recognize in any Office proceeding a replacement deposit made by the patent owner where the depository could furnish samples of the original deposit being replaced. The best evidence of what was originally deposited should not be lost through destruction or replacement if made in association with an existing patent. A supplemental deposit may be accepted in an Office proceeding, however, depending on the circumstances in each case.

# 2408    Term of Deposit [R-07.2022]

#### _37 C.F.R. 1.806   Term of deposit._

A deposit made before or during pendency of an application for patent shall be made for a term of at least thirty (30) years and at least five (5) years after the most recent request for the furnishing of a sample of the deposit was received by the depository. In any case, samples must be stored under agreements that would make them available beyond the enforceable life of the patent for which the deposit was made.

The term of deposit must satisfy the requirements of the Budapest Treaty which sets a term of at least 30 years from the date of deposit and at least 5 years after the most recent request for the furnishing of a sample of the deposit was received by the depository. In the event that the 30-year term of deposit covers the 17-year term or 20-year term of the patent (see **[MPEP § 2701](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e271945.html)**) plus 6 years to include the Statute of Limitations, no further requirement is necessary. Unless applicant indicates that the deposit has been made under the Budapest Treaty, applicant must indicate the term for which the deposit has been made. The mere possibility of patent term extension or extended litigation involving the patent should not be considered in this analysis.

In the event that the 30-year term of deposit measured from the date of deposit would necessarily terminate within the period of enforceability of the patent (the patent term (see **[MPEP § 2701](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e271945.html)**) plus 6 years to include the Statute of Limitations), samples must be stored under agreements that would make them available beyond the enforceable life of the patent for which the deposit was made. No requirement should be made as to any particular period of time beyond the enforceable life of the patent. The purpose of the requirement is to ensure that a deposited biological material necessary for the practice of a patented invention would be available to the public after expiration of the patent for which the deposit was made. The term of the deposit must comply with the requirements of each sentence of **[37 CFR 1.806](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333444.html)**  whether or not the deposit is made under the Budapest Treaty. A specific statement that the deposit would be stored under agreements that would make them available beyond the enforceable life of the patent for which the deposit was made is required only where the 30-year term of deposit would terminate within the enforceable life of the patent.

# 2409    Viability of Deposit [R-07.2015]

#### _37 C.F.R. 1.807   Viability of deposit._

- (a) A deposit of biological material that is capable of self-replication either directly or indirectly must be viable at the time of deposit and during the term of deposit. Viability may be tested by the depository. The test must conclude only that the deposited material is capable of reproduction. No evidence is necessarily required regarding the ability of the deposited material to perform any function described in the patent application.
- (b) A viability statement for each deposit of a biological material defined in paragraph (a) of this section not made under the Budapest Treaty on the International Recognition of the Deposit of Microorganisms for the Purposes of Patent Procedure must be filed in the application and must contain:
    - (1) The name and address of the depository;
    - (2) The name and address of the depositor;
    - (3) The date of deposit;
    - (4) The identity of the deposit and the accession number given by the depository;
    - (5) The date of the viability test;
    - (6) The procedures used to obtain a sample if the test is not done by the depository; and
    - (7) A statement that the deposit is capable of reproduction.
- (c) If a viability test indicates that the deposit is not viable upon receipt, or the examiner cannot, for scientific or other valid reasons, accept the statement of viability received from the applicant, the examiner shall proceed as if no deposit has been made. The examiner will accept the conclusion set forth in a viability statement issued by a depository recognized under **[§ 1.803(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333237.html)**.

**[37 CFR 1.807](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333457.html)**  requires that the deposit of biological material that is capable of self-replication either directly or indirectly must be viable at the time of deposit and during the term of deposit. This requirement for viability is essentially a requirement that the deposited material is capable of reproduction. For the purpose of making a deposit under these rules, there is no requirement that evidence be provided that the deposited material is capable or has the ability to perform any function described in the patent application. However, as with any other issue of description or enablement, if the examiner has evidence or reason to question the objective statements made in the patent application, applicants may be required to demonstrate that the deposited biological material will perform in the manner described.

Under the Budapest Treaty, there is a requirement that the deposit be tested for viability before it is accepted. Thus, a mere statement by an applicant, an authorized representative of applicant or the assignee that the deposit has been accepted under the Budapest Treaty would satisfy **[37 CFR 1.807](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333457.html)**. The examiner should note the clear distinction between a statement by the applicant that the deposit has been made under the Budapest Treaty and one in which the deposit has been made and accepted under the Budapest Treaty. Where a statement is merely an indication that a deposit has been made (with no indication as to whether it has been accepted), there is no assurance that the requirements under **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302824912.html)**  have been satisfied.

For each deposit which is not made under the Budapest Treaty, a viability statement must be filed in the patent application and contain the information listed in paragraph (b) of this section. Under **[37 CFR 1.807(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333457.html)**, the examiner will accept the conclusion set forth in a viability statement which is issued by a depository recognized under **[37 CFR 1.803(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333237.html)**. If the viability test indicates that the deposit is not viable upon receipt, or the examiner cannot, for scientific or other valid reasons, accept the statement of viability received from the applicant, the examiner shall so notify the applicant stating the reasons for not accepting the statement and proceed with the examination process as if no deposit had been made.

# 2410    Furnishing of Samples [R-08.2012]

#### _37 C.F.R. 1.808   Furnishing of samples._

- (a) A deposit must be made under conditions that assure that:
    - (1) Access to the deposit will be available during pendency of the patent application making reference to the deposit to one determined by the Commissioner to be entitled thereto under **[§ 1.14](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e314245.html)**  and **[35 U.S.C. 122](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e303054.html)**, and
    - (2) Subject to paragraph (b) of this section, all restrictions imposed by the depositor on the availability to the public of the deposited material will be irrevocably removed upon the granting of the patent.
- (b) The depositor may contract with the depository to require that samples of a deposited biological material shall be furnished only if a request for a sample, during the term of the patent:
    - (1) Is in writing or other tangible form and dated;
    - (2) Contains the name and address of the requesting party and the accession number of the deposit; and
    - (3) Is communicated in writing by the depository to the depositor along with the date on which the sample was furnished and the name and address of the party to whom the sample was furnished.
- (c) Upon request made to the Office, the Office will certify whether a deposit has been stated to have been made under conditions which make it available to the public as of the issue date of the patent grant provided the request contains:
    - (1) The name and address of the depository;
    - (2) The accession number given to the deposit;
    - (3) The patent number and issue date of the patent referring to the deposit; and
    - (4) The name and address of the requesting party.

# 2410.01    Conditions of Deposit [R-07.2015]

**[37 CFR 1.808](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333511.html)**  requires that the deposit of biological material be made under two conditions:

- (A) access to the deposit will be available during pendency of the patent application making reference to the deposit to one determined by the Commissioner to be entitled thereto under **[37 CFR 1.14](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e314245.html)**  and **[35 U.S.C. 122](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e303054.html)**, and
- (B) with one exception, that all restrictions imposed by the depositor on the availability to the public of the deposited biological material be irrevocably removed upon the granting of the patent.

The one exception that is permitted is specified in **[37 CFR 1.808(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333511.html)**  which permits the depositor to contract with the depository to require that samples of a deposited biological material shall be furnished only if a request for a sample, during the term of the patent, meets any one or all of the three conditions specified in this paragraph. These conditions are:

- (A) the request is in writing or other tangible form and dated; and/or
- (B) the request contains the name and address of the requesting party and the accession number of the deposit; and/or
- (C) the request is communicated in writing by the depository to the depositor along with the date on which the sample was furnished and the name and address of the party to whom the sample was furnished.

It should be noted that this exception to the general rule that all restrictions will be removed must be strictly followed and that no variations of this explicit exception will be accepted as meeting the conditions of this section. Although this exception is consistent with the provisions in the Budapest Treaty and its implementing regulations (**[Rule 11.4](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e366850.html##d0e366919)** ), other conditions on accessibility are permitted under the Budapest Treaty as prescribed by national law. Consequently, the mere indication that a deposit has been made and accepted under conditions prescribed by the Budapest Treaty would satisfy all conditions of these regulations except the requirement that all restrictions on access be removed on grant of the patent. _Ex parte Hildebrand,_ 15 USPQ2d 1662 (Bd. Pat. App. & Int. 1990).

# 2410.02    Certification of Statement of Availability of Deposit [R-01.2024]

Since the mere description of a deposit or identity of a deposit in a patent specification is not necessarily an indication that a requirement for deposit was made or that a deposit which complies with these rules has been made, accessibility to a deposited material referenced in a patent may depend on the satisfaction of conditions not apparent on the face of the patent. For these reasons, and upon request made to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the Office will certify whether a deposit has been stated to have been made under conditions which make it available to the public as of the issue date of the patent grant provided the request is made to a Director of Technology Center (TC) 1600, and contains the following information:

- (A) the name and address of the depository;
- (B) the accession number given to the deposit;
- (C) the patent number and issue date of the patent referring to the deposit; and
- (D) the name and address of the requesting party.

Persons requesting a certificate of statement of availability of deposit should contact the TC 1600 Director's office directly, and should not submit a request via the examiner of record.

The Office will not certify whether a deposit has been made under conditions which would make it available to the public until the issuance of a U.S. Patent referencing the deposit. For example, a request for such certification will not be considered where the request is filed with regard to a deposit referenced in an international application filed under the PCT, in an international application that entered the U.S. national stage, or any other U.S. national application, that has not yet issued as a patent.

See also **[MPEP § 2404.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e240816.html)**.

For those deposits made pursuant to the Budapest Treaty, the World Intellectual Property Organization provides a form (Form BP-12) for requesting a certification of legal entitlement to receive samples of deposited microorganisms pursuant to Rule 11.3(a) of the Regulations under the Budapest Treaty. The form is available at **[www.wipo.int/budapest/en/guide/](https://www.wipo.int/budapest/en/guide/)**.

# 2411    Examination Procedures [R-07.2015]

#### _37 C.F.R. 1.809   Examination procedures._

- (a) The examiner shall determine pursuant to **[§ 1.104](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e322124.html)**  in each application for patent, application for reissue patent or reexamination proceeding if a deposit is needed, and if needed, if a deposit actually made is acceptable for patent purposes. If a deposit is needed and has not been made or replaced or supplemented in accordance with these regulations, the examiner, where appropriate, shall reject the affected claims under the appropriate provision of **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302824.html)**, explaining why a deposit is needed and/or why a deposit actually made cannot be accepted.
- (b) The applicant for patent or patent owner shall reply to a rejection under paragraph (a) of this section by—
    - (1) In the case of an applicant for patent, either making an acceptable original, replacement, or supplemental deposit, or assuring the Office in writing that an acceptable deposit will be made; or, in the case of a patent owner, requesting a certificate of correction of the patent which meets the terms of paragraphs (b) and (c) of **[§ 1.805](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333345.html)**, or
    - (2) Arguing why a deposit is not needed under the circumstances of the application or patent considered and/or why a deposit actually made should be accepted. Other replies to the examiner’s action shall be considered nonresponsive. The rejection will be repeated until either paragraph (b)(1) of this section is satisfied or the examiner is convinced that a deposit is not needed.
- (c) If an application for patent is otherwise in condition for allowance except for a needed deposit and the Office has received a written assurance that an acceptable deposit will be made, the Office may notify the applicant in a notice of allowability and set a three month period of time from the mailing date of the notice of allowability within which the deposit must be made in order to avoid abandonment. This time period is not extendable under **[§ 1.136](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e323655.html)**  (see **[§ 1.136(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e323655.html##d0e323772)** ).
- (d) For each deposit made pursuant to these regulations, the specification shall contain:
    - (1) The accession number for the deposit;
    - (2) The date of the deposit;
    - (3) A description of the deposited biological material sufficient to specifically identify it and to permit examination; and
    - (4) The name and address of the depository.
- (e) Any amendment required by paragraphs (d)(1), (d)(2) or (d)(4) of this section must be filed before or with the payment of the issue fee (see **[§ 1.312](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e326304.html)** ).

**[37 CFR 1.809](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333576.html)**  sets forth procedures that will be used by the examiner to address a deposit issue. The burden is initially on the Office to establish that access to a biological material is necessary for the satisfaction of the statutory requirements for patentability under **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302824.html)**. Once the Office has met this burden, the burden shifts to the applicant or patent owner to demonstrate that access to such biological material either is not necessary, or is already available, or that a deposit of such material will be made in accordance with these regulations.

# 2411.01    Rejections Based on Deposit Issue [R-07.2015]

Under **[37 CFR 1.809(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333576.html)**, once the examiner has determined that access to a biological material is necessary, and there is no information that would support the conclusion that access is currently available in accordance with these regulations, the examiner should make an appropriate rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302824.html)**  until such time as a deposit in accordance with these regulations is actually made or a written assurance is received in the patent application that such a deposit will be made upon an indication of allowability of the application. The examiner should clearly indicate the statutory basis for the rejection and the reasons that are relied upon by the examiner to conclude that the application does not comply with some requirement of **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302824.html)**. Although not exhaustive, the following grounds of rejection may be applicable in appropriate circumstances:

- (A) _**[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**, enablement requirement._ Rejection for lack of an enabling disclosure without access to a specific biological material. This ground of rejection should be accompanied by evidence of scientific reasoning to support the conclusion that a person skilled in the art could not make or use the invention defined in and commensurate with the claims without access to the specific biological material. See **[MPEP § 2164.06(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e216038.html)**.
- (B) _**[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**, written description requirement._ A rejection for lack of written description typically arises in the context that the application as filed does not contain a description to support an amendment to the specification or claims, although it can arise in the context of original claims. See **[MPEP § 2163](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e213583.html)** _et seq._ An amendment to the claims that is not described in the application as filed would justify a rejection of the affected claims under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**. If an amendment is made to the application, other than the claims, that is not described in the application as filed, this would justify a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**  and/or an objection under **[35 U.S.C. 132](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e303187.html)**  (prohibition against the introduction of new matter) and a requirement that the amendment be canceled.
- (C) _**[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**, best mode requirement._ A rejection for lack of a best mode will be rare in the _ex parte_ examination process because it requires (1) a finding by the examiner that, at the time the application was filed, the inventor(s) knew of a specific material that was considered by the inventor(s) to be better than any other, and (2) if a best mode was contemplated at that time, that the inventor(s) concealed the best mode (accidentally or intentionally) by failing to adequately describe that best mode. See _Chemcast Corp. v. Arco Industries Corp.,_ 913 F.2d 923, 16 USPQ2d 1033 (Fed. Cir. 1990). See also **[MPEP § 2165](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e216924.html)** _et seq._

- (E) _**[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)**, requirement to claim what the inventor or a joint inventor regards as the invention._ A rejection on the basis that the claims do not set forth the subject matter that the inventor or a joint inventor regards as the invention requires the citation of some evidence, not contained in the application as filed, to support the rejection. _In re Prater,_ 415 F.2d 1393, 162 USPQ 541 (CCPA 1969). Any disagreement between the content of the application disclosure and the scope of the claims should be addressed under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**. See _In re Ehrreich,_ 590 F.2d 902, 200 USPQ 504 (CCPA 1979).

# 2411.02    Replies to Rejections Based on Deposit Issue [R-07.2015]

Once a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302824.html)**  has been made by the examiner directed to the absence of access to a biological material, applicant may reply, pursuant to **[37 CFR 1.809(b)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333576.html)**, by either making an acceptable original, replacement, or supplemental deposit in accordance with these regulations, or assuring the Office in writing that an acceptable deposit will be made on or before the date of payment of the issue fee, or by submitting an argument of why a deposit is not required under the circumstances of the application being considered. Other replies to such a rejection by the examiner shall be considered nonresponsive and may result in abandonment of the application. The rejection will be repeated and made final until the requirements of **[37 CFR 1.809(b)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333576.html)**  are satisfied or the examiner is convinced that a deposit is not required for the claimed subject matter. Once the rejection is made final, the requirements of **[37 CFR 1.116](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e322826.html)**  apply to further submissions. The written assurance will be accepted by the Office if it clearly states that an acceptable deposit will be made within the required time and under conditions which satisfy these rules. In the case that an acceptable written assurance has been made by the applicant, the rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302824.html)**  directed to the absence of access to the biological material should be removed.

# 2411.03    Application in Condition for Allowance Except for Deposit [R-07.2015]

As set forth in **[37 CFR 1.809(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333576.html)**, in the event that an application for patent is otherwise in condition for allowance except for a required deposit and the Office has received a written assurance that an acceptable deposit will be made, the Office may notify the applicant in a notice of allowability and set a three month period of time from the mailing date of the notice of allowability within which the deposit must be made in order to avoid abandonment. This time period is not extendable under **[37 CFR 1.136](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e323655.html)**  (see **[37 CFR 1.136(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e323655.html##d0e323772)** ). Failure to make the needed deposit in accordance with this requirement will be considered a failure to prosecute the application under **[35 U.S.C. 133](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e303207aia.html)**  and result in abandonment of the application.

Once the deposit has been made, information regarding the deposit, such as the name and address of the depository, the accession number and the date of the deposit, that is to be added to the specification must be added by means of filing an amendment under the provisions of **[37 CFR 1.312](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e326304.html)**. Such an amendment must be filed before or with the payment of the issue fee. Therefore, applicants need to make any necessary deposit of biological material well prior to payment of the issue fee such that the accession number is received with sufficient time remaining to amend the specification as required by **[37 CFR 1.809(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333576.html)**  on or before the date the issue fee is paid. See **[37 CFR 1.809(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333576.html)**.

Specifically, the specification shall contain the accession number for the deposit, the date of the deposit, the name and address of the depository, and a description of the deposited biological material sufficient to specifically identify it and to permit examination. The description also must be sufficient to permit verification that the deposited biological material is in fact that disclosed. Once the patent issues, the description must be sufficient to aid in the resolution of questions of infringement. As a general rule, the more information that is provided about a particular deposited biological material, the better the examiner will be able to compare the identity and characteristics of the deposited biological material with the prior art.

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 3(a), defines "amino acid" to mean any amino acid that can be represented using any of the symbols shown in Annex I, Table 3: List of Amino Acids Symbols of WIPO Standard ST.26 (reproduced in **[MPEP § 2412.03(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1e_1b8a1_1a6.html)**). Such amino acids include, _inter alia,_ D-amino acids and amino acids containing modified or synthetic side chains. Amino acids will be construed as unmodified L-amino acids unless further described in a "feature table". See **[MPEP § 2413.01(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1f_1b279_ed.html)**, subsection I, for discussion of a "feature table".

Modified amino acids, including D-amino acids, should be represented in the sequence as the corresponding unmodified amino acids whenever possible. Any modified amino acid in a sequence that cannot otherwise be represented by a symbol set forth in Table 3 must be represented by "X", i.e., an "other" amino acid.

A modified amino acid must be further described in a feature table. See MPEP § 2413.01(g), subsection I, for discussion of a "feature table". Where applicable, the feature keys "CARBOHYD" or "LIPID" should be used together with the qualifier "note". The feature key "MOD_RES" should be used for other post-translationally modified amino acids together with the qualifier "note". The feature key "SITE" together with the qualifier "note" should be used when the modified amino acid is not a post-translationally modified amino acid. See **[MPEP § 2413.01(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1f_1b279_ed.html)**, subsections II and III, for discussion of a "feature key". The value for the qualifier "note" must either be an abbreviation set forth in Table 4 below or the complete, unabbreviated name of the modified amino acid. The abbreviations set forth in Table 4 or the complete, unabbreviated names must not be used in the sequence itself.

Where no sequence is present for a sequence identifier, i.e. an intentionally skipped sequence, "000" must be used in place of a sequence in a "Sequence Listing XML". The total number of sequences indicated in the "Sequence Listing XML" must equal the total number of sequence identifiers, whether followed by a sequence or by "000".

WIPO Standard ST.26 paragraphs 58 and 59 require that an intentionally skipped sequences in a "Sequence Listing XML" must be represented as follows:

- (a) the value of the element SequenceData and its attribute sequenceIDNumber, is the sequence identifier of the skipped sequence;
- (b) no value is provided for the elements INSDSeq _length, INSDSeq _moltype, and INSDSeq _division;
- (c) the element INSDSeq _feature-table is not included; and
- (d) the value of the element INSDSeq _sequence is the string "000".

## I.    **REPRESENTATION OF NUCLEOTIDE SEQUENCE**

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 11, provides that a nucleotide sequence must be represented only by a single strand, in the 5’ to 3’ direction from left to right, or in the direction from left to right that mimics the 5’ to 3’ direction. The designations 5’ and 3’ or any other similar designations must not be included in the sequence. A double-stranded nucleotide sequence disclosed by enumeration of the residues of both strands must be represented as:

- (a) a single sequence or as two separate sequences, each assigned its own sequence identifier, where the two separate strands are fully complementary to each other, or
- (b) two separate sequences, each assigned its own sequence identifier, where the two strands are not fully complementary to each other.

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 12, provides that the first nucleotide presented in the sequence is residue position number 1. When nucleotide sequences are circular in configuration, applicant must choose the nucleotide in residue position number 1. Numbering is continuous throughout the entire sequence in the 5’ to 3’ direction, or in the direction that mimics the 5’ to 3’ direction. The last residue position number must equal the number of nucleotides in the sequence.

## II.    **SYMBOLS FOR A NUCLEOTIDE SEQUENCE**

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 13, provides that all nucleotides in a sequence must be represented using the symbols as listed in Table 1: List of Nucleotides Symbols (see **[MPEP § 2412.03(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1e_1b8a1_1a6.html)**). Only lower-case letters must be used. Any symbol used to represent a nucleotide is the equivalent of only one residue.

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 14, sets forth that the symbol "t" will be construed as thymine in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and uracil in ribonucleic acid (RNA). Uracil in DNA or thymine in RNA is considered a modified nucleotide and must be further described in a feature table. See **[MPEP § 2413.01(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1f_1b279_ed.html)**, subsection I for more detail regarding a "feature table."

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 15, provides that where an ambiguity symbol (representing two or more alternative nucleotides) is appropriate, the most restrictive symbol should be used, as listed in Table 1: List of Nucleotides Symbols (see **[MPEP § 2412.03(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1e_1b8a1_1a6.html)**). For example, if a nucleotide in a given position could be "a" or "g", then "r" should be used, rather than "n". The symbol "n" will be construed as any one of "a", "c", "g", or "t/u" except where it is used with a further description in a feature table. The symbol "n" must not be used to represent anything other than a nucleotide. A single modified or "unknown" nucleotide may be represented by the symbol "n", together with a further description in a feature table. See **[MPEP § 2413.01(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1f_1b279_ed.html)**, subsection I, for more detail regarding a "feature table." For representation of sequence variants, i.e., alternatives, deletions, insertions or substitutions relative to a primary sequence, see **[MPEP § 2412.05(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1e_2102d_21e.html)**; and also **[MPEP § 2413.01(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1f_1b279_ed.html)**, subsection XII for information on variants.

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 16, sets forth that modified nucleotides should be represented in the sequence as the corresponding unmodified nucleotides, i.e., "a", "c", "g" or "t" whenever possible. Any modified nucleotide in a sequence that cannot otherwise be represented by any other symbol in Table 1: List of Nucleotides Symbols (see **[MPEP § 2412.03(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1e_1b8a1_1a6.html)**), i.e., an "other" nucleotide, such as a non-naturally occurring nucleotide, must be represented by the symbol "n". The symbol "n" is the equivalent of only one residue.

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 19, specifies that uracil in DNA or thymine in RNA are considered modified nucleotides and must be represented in the sequence as "t" and be further described in a feature table using the feature key "modified_base", the qualifier "mod_base" with "OTHER" as the qualifier value and the qualifier "note" with "uracil" or "thymine", respectively, as the qualifier value. See **[MPEP § 2413.01(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1f_1b279_ed.html)**, subsection I for more detail regarding a "feature table."

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 21, provides that any "unknown" nucleotide must be represented by the symbol "n" in the sequence. An "unknown" nucleotide should be further described in a feature table using the feature key "unsure". The symbol "n" is the equivalent of only one residue. See **[MPEP § 2413.01(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1f_1b279_ed.html)**, subsection I, for more detail regarding a "feature table."

## III.    **DESCRIPTION OF MODIFIED NUCLEOTIDES WITHIN A NUCLEOTIDE SEQUENCE**

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 17, specifies that a modified nucleotide must be further described in a feature table (see **[MPEP § 2413.01(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1f_1b279_ed.html)**, subsection I, for more detail regarding a "feature table") using the feature key "modified_base" and the mandatory qualifier "mod_base" in conjunction with a single abbreviation from Table 2: List of Modified Nucleotides, below, as the qualifier value. See **[MPEP § 2413.01(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1f_1b279_ed.html)** subsections II and III, for more information regarding use of a feature key; and **[MPEP § 2413.01(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1f_1b279_ed.html)** subsections V and VI, for more information regarding use of a qualifier. If the abbreviation is "OTHER", the complete unabbreviated name of the modified nucleotide must be provided as the value in a "note" qualifier. For a listing of alternative modified nucleotides, the qualifier value "OTHER" may be used in conjunction with a further "note" qualifier. The abbreviations (or full names) provided in Table 2 must not be used in the sequence itself.

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 18, describes that a nucleotide sequence including one or more regions of consecutive modified nucleotides that share the same backbone moiety must be further described in a feature table as required for a modified nucleotide. See **[MPEP § 2413.01(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1f_1b279_ed.html)**, subsection I, for information regarding a feature table and **[MPEP § 2412.03(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1e_1b9ed_9d.html)** regarding modified nucleotides. The modified nucleotides of each such region may be jointly described in a single INSDFeature element of a "feature table" as described below. See **[MPEP § 2413.01(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1f_1b279_ed.html)**, subsection I, for information regarding INSDFeature elements of a feature table. The most restrictive unabbreviated chemical name that encompasses all of the modified nucleotides in the range or a list of the chemical names of all the nucleotides in the range must be provided as the value in the "note" qualifier. For example, a glycol nucleic acid sequence containing "a", "c", "g", or "t" nucleobases may be described in the "note" qualifier as "2,3-dihydroxypropyl nucleosides." Alternatively, the same sequence may be described in the "note" qualifier as "2,3-dihydroxypropyladenine, 2,3-dihydroxypropylthymine, 2,3-dihydroxypropylguanine, or 2,3-dihydroxypropylcytosine." Where an individual modified nucleotide in the region includes an additional modification, then the modified nucleotide must also be further described in the feature table as required for a modified nucleotide.

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 19, provides that uracil in DNA or thymine in RNA are considered modified nucleotides and must be represented in the sequence as "t" and be further described in a feature table using the feature key "modified_base", the qualifier "mod_base" with "OTHER" as the qualifier value and the qualifier "note" with "uracil" or "thymine", respectively, as the qualifier value.See **[MPEP § 2413.01(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1f_1b279_ed.html)**, subsections II and III, for more information regarding use of a feature key; and **[MPEP § 2413.01(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1f_1b279_ed.html)**, subsections V and VI, for more information regarding use of a qualifier.

## I.    **REPRESENTATION OF AN AMINO ACID SEQUENCE**

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 24, specifies that the amino acids in an amino acid sequence must be represented in the amino to carboxy direction from left to right. The amino and carboxy groups must not be represented in the sequence.

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 25, indicates that the first amino acid in the sequence is residue position number 1, including amino acids preceding the mature protein, for example, pre-sequences, pro-sequences, pre-pro-sequences and signal sequences. When an amino acid sequence is circular in configuration and the ring consists solely of amino acid residues linked by peptide bonds, i.e., the sequence has no amino and carboxy termini, applicant must choose the amino acid in residue position number 1. Numbering is continuous through the entire sequence in the amino to carboxy direction.

## II.    **SYMBOLS FOR AN AMINO ACID SEQUENCE**

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 26, specifies that all amino acids in a sequence must be represented using the symbols set forth in Table 3: List of Amino Acids Symbols, in **[MPEP § 2412.03(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1e_1b8a1_1a6.html)** above. Only uppercase letters must be used. Any symbol used to represent an amino acid is the equivalent of only one residue.

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 27, indicates that where an ambiguity symbol (representing two or more amino acids in the alternative) is appropriate, the most restrictive symbol should be used, as listed in Table 3: List of Amino Acids Symbols (**[MPEP § 2412.03(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1e_1b8a1_1a6.html)**). For example, if an amino acid in a given position could be aspartic acid or asparagine, the symbol "B" should be used, rather than "X". The symbol "X" will be construed as any one of "A", "R", "N", "D", "C", "Q", "E", "G", "H", "I", "L", "K", "M", "F", "P", "O", "S", "U", "T", "W", "Y", or "V", except where it is used with a further description in the feature table. The symbol "X" must not be used to represent anything other than an amino acid. A single modified or "unknown" amino acid may be represented by the symbol "X", together with a further description in a feature table (see **[MPEP § 2413.01(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1f_1b279_ed.html)**, subsection I or MPEP § 2412.03(c), for more detail regarding a "feature table"). For representation and inclusion of sequence variants, see **[MPEP § 2412.05(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1e_2102d_21e.html)**. For details of how to represent variants in a "Sequence Listing XML," see **[MPEP § 2413.01(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1f_1b279_ed.html)**, subsection XI.

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 28, specifies that disclosed amino acid sequences separated by internal terminator symbols, represented for example by "Ter" or asterisk "*" or period "." or a blank space, must be included as separate sequences for each enumerated amino acid sequence that contains at least four specifically defined amino acids and is encompassed by the description of sequences found in **[MPEP § 2412.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35dcb_22374_144.html)**. Each such separate sequence must be assigned its own sequence identifier (see **[MPEP § 2412.05(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1e_20ff6_1f.html)**). Terminator symbols and spaces must not be included in a sequence contained in a "Sequence Listing XML".

Any "unknown" amino acid must be represented by the symbol "X" in the sequence. An "unknown" amino acid designated as "X" must be further described in a feature table (see **[MPEP § 2413.01(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1f_1b279_ed.html)**, subsection I, for more detail regarding a "feature table" ) using the feature key "UNSURE" and optionally the qualifier "note." The symbol "X" is the equivalent of only one residue (WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 32).

## III.    **DESCRIPTION OF MODIFIED AMINO ACIDS WITHIN AN AMINO ACID SEQUENCE**

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 29, specifies that modified amino acids, including D-amino acids, should be represented in the sequence as the corresponding unmodified amino acids whenever possible. Any modified amino acid in a sequence that cannot otherwise be represented by any other symbol in Table 3: List of Amino Acids Symbols (see **[MPEP § 2412.03(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1e_1b8a1_1a6.html)**), i.e., an "other" amino acid, must be represented by "X". The symbol "X" is the equivalent of only one residue.

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 30, provides that a modified amino acid must be further described in a feature table (see **[MPEP § 2413.01(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1f_1b279_ed.html)**, subsection I, for more detail regarding a "feature table"). Where applicable, the feature keys "CARBOHYD" or "LIPID" should be used together with the qualifier "note". The feature key "MOD_RES" should be used for other post-translationally modified amino acids together with the qualifier "note". The feature key "SITE" together with the qualifier "note" should be used when the modified amino acid is not a post-translationally modified amino acid. The value for the qualifier "note" must either be an abbreviation set forth in Table 4: List of Modified Amino Acids (see **[MPEP § 2412.03(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1e_1b8b3_257.html)**), above, or the complete, unabbreviated name of the modified amino acid. The abbreviations set forth in Table 4, or the complete, unabbreviated names must not be used in the sequence itself.

## IV.    **JOINTLY DESCRIBING A REGION OF AN AMINO ACID SEQUENCE**

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 34, provides that a region containing a known number of contiguous "X" residues for which the same description applies may be jointly described in one feature key using the syntax "x..y" as the location descriptor in the element INSDFeature_location (see **[MPEP § 2413.01(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1f_1b279_ed.html)** subsections II-III for information regarding "feature keys" and subsection IV, for information regarding INSDFeature_location). For representation and inclusion of sequence variants, see **[MPEP § 2412.05(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1e_2102d_21e.html)**.

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 36, describes that a sequence that contains regions of specifically defined residues separated by one or more regions of contiguous "n" or "X" residues, wherein the exact number of "n" or "X" residues in each region is disclosed, must be included in the "Sequence Listing XML" as one sequence and assigned its own sequence identifier.

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 37, describes that a sequence that contains regions of specifically defined residues separated by one or more gaps of an unknown or undisclosed number of residues must not be represented in the "Sequence Listing XML" as a single sequence. Each region of specifically defined residues (as encompassed by the definition in **[37 CFR 1.831(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_it_35d57_211e4_8c.html)** ) must be included in the "Sequence Listing XML" as a separate sequence and assigned its own sequence identifier.

# 2412.06    The Requirement for Exclusive Conformance; Sequences Presented in Drawing Figures [R-01.2024]

_[Editor Note: This section is applicable to all applications with a filing date, or, for national phase applications, an international filing date, on or after July 1, 2022, having disclosure of one or more nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences as defined in **[37 CFR 1.831(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1bdc8_2b8.html##ar_it_35d57_211e4_8c)**.]_

For all applications that disclose a nucleotide sequence and/or amino acid sequence(s) by enumeration of its residues, as defined in **[37 CFR 1.831(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1bdc8_2b8.html##ar_it_35d57_211e4_8c)**, **[37 CFR 1.831(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1bdc8_2b8.html##ar_it_35d57_211ca_219)**  requires conformance to the requirements of **[37 CFR 1.832](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1bde4_172.html)**  through **[37 CFR 1.834](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1be3b_1cf.html)**  with regard to the manner in which the disclosed nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences are presented and described in the "Sequence Listing XML." This requirement is necessary to minimize any confusion that could result if more than one format for representing sequence data was employed in a given application.

Pursuant to **[37 CFR 1.83(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e320967.html##d0e320975)**, sequences that are included in the "Sequence Listing XML" should not be duplicated in the drawings. With the use of feature keys and qualifiers in a "Sequence Listing XML" to represent and describe features of a nucleotide or amino acid sequence, the need to re-present a sequence in a drawing is less critical. However, in certain instances, a significant sequence characteristic may not be readily conveyed by the sequence-associated data of the "Sequence Listing XML" and may need to be depicted in a figure. For example, in view of the fact that the representation of double stranded nucleic acids is not permitted in the "Sequence Listing XML," many significant nucleic acid features, such as "sticky ends" and the like, may only be shown effectively by reference to a drawing figure. Further, the similarity or homology between/among sequences may only be depicted in an effective manner in a drawing figure. Similarly, drawing figures are recommended for use with amino acid sequences to depict structural features of the corresponding protein, such as epitopes and interaction domains. The situations discussed herein are given by way of example only and there may be many other reasons for including a sequence in a drawing. However, when an enumerated sequence is presented in a drawing, the sequence must still be included in the "Sequence Listing XML" if the sequence falls within the definition set forth in **[37 CFR 1.831(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1bdc8_2b8.html##ar_it_35d57_211e4_8c)**, and a sequence identifier (preceded by "SEQ ID NO:X" or the like) must be used, either in the drawing itself or in the Brief Description of the Drawings.

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 53, specifies that the element INSDSeq_length must disclose the number of nucleotides or amino acids of the sequence contained in the INSDSeq_sequence element.

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 54, specifies that the element INSDSeq_moltype must disclose the type of molecule that is being represented. For nucleotide sequences, including nucleotide analogue sequences, the molecule type must be indicated as DNA or RNA. For amino acid sequences, the molecule type must be indicated as AA.

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 55, specifies that for a nucleotide sequence that contains both DNA and RNA segments of one or more nucleotides, the molecule type must be indicated as DNA. The combined DNA/RNA molecule must be further described in the feature table, using the feature key "source" and the mandatory qualifier "organism" with the value "synthetic construct" and the mandatory qualifier "mol_type" with the value "other DNA." Each DNA and RNA segment of the combined DNA/RNA molecule must be further described with the feature key "misc_feature" and the qualifier "note," wherein the qualifier value indicates whether the segment is DNA or RNA.

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 57, specifies that the element INSDSeq_sequence must disclose the sequence. Only the appropriate symbols set forth in Table 1: List of Nucleotides Symbols and Table 3: List of Amino Acids Symbols (see **[MPEP § 2412.03(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1e_1b8a1_1a6.html)**) must be included in the sequence. The sequence must not include numbers, punctuation or whitespace characters.

## I.    **FEATURE TABLE**

According to WIPO Standard ST.26, a "feature table" "contains information on the location and roles of various regions within a particular sequence. A feature table is required for every sequence, except for any intentionally skipped sequence, in which case it must not be included. The feature table is contained in the element INSDSeq_feature-table, which consists of one or more INSDFeature elements." (WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 60).

WIPO Standard ST.26 specifies that each INSDFeature element that comprises the feature table describes one feature, and consists of dependent elements as follows:

|Element|Description|Mandatory/Optional|
|---|---|---|
|INSDFeature_key|A word or abbreviation indicating a feature|Mandatory|
|INSDFeature_location|Region of the sequence which corresponds to the feature|Mandatory|
|INSDFeature_quals|Qualifier containing auxiliary information about a feature|Mandatory where the feature key requires one or more qualifiers, e.g., source; otherwise, Optional|

Reproduced from paragraph 61 of WIPO Standard ST.26.

## II.    **FEATURE KEYS**

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 62, specifies that Annex I contains the exclusive listing of feature keys that must be used when preparing and submitting a "Sequence Listing XML," along with an exclusive listing of associated qualifiers and an indication as to whether those qualifiers are mandatory or optional. Section 5 of Annex I of WIPO Standard ST.26 provides the exclusive listing of feature keys for nucleotide sequences and Section 7 of Annex I of WIPO Standard ST.26 provides the exclusive listing of feature keys for amino acid sequences.

## III.    **MANDATORY FEATURE KEYS**

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 63, specifies that the "source" feature key is mandatory for all nucleotide sequences and for all amino acid sequences, except for any intentionally skipped sequence. Each sequence must have a single "source" feature key spanning the entire sequence. Where a sequence originates from multiple sources, those sources may be further described in the feature table, using the feature key "misc_feature" and the qualifier "note" for nucleotide sequences, and the feature key "REGION" and the qualifier "note" for amino acid sequences.

## IV.    **FEATURE LOCATION**

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 64, specifies that the mandatory element INSDFeature_location must contain at least one location descriptor, which defines a site or a region corresponding to a feature of the sequence in the INSDSeq_sequence element. Amino acid sequences must contain one and only one location descriptor in the mandatory INSDFeature_location element. Nucleotide sequences may have more than one location descriptor in the mandatory INSDFeature_location element when used in conjunction with one or more location operator(s) (more information about location descriptors is discussed below).

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 65, specifies that the location descriptor can be a single residue number, a region delimiting a contiguous span of residue numbers, or a site or region that extends beyond the specified residue or span of residues. The location descriptor must not include numbering for residues beyond the range of the sequence in the INSDSeq_sequence element. For nucleotide sequences only, a location descriptor can be a site between two adjacent residue numbers. Multiple location descriptors must be used in conjunction with a location operator when a feature corresponds to discontinuous sites or regions of a nucleotide sequence (more information about location descriptors and operators is discussed below).

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 66, specifies that the syntax for each type of location descriptor is indicated in Tables (a)-(c) below, where x and y are residue numbers, indicated as positive integers, not greater than the length of the sequence in the INSDSeq_sequence element, and x is less than y.

(a) Location descriptors for nucleotide and amino acid sequences:

|Location descriptor type|Syntax|Description|
|---|---|---|
|Single residue number|x|Points to a single residue in a sequence.|
|Residue numbers delimitating a sequence span|x. .y|Points to a continuous range of residues bounded by and including the starting and ending residues.|
|Residues before the first or beyond the last specified residue number|<x<br><br>>x<br><br><x. .y<br><br>x. .>y<br><br><x. .>y|Points to a region including a specified residue or span of residues and extending beyond a specified residue. The '<' and '>' symbols may be used with a single residue or the starting and ending residue numbers of a span of residues to indicate that a feature extends beyond the specified residue number.|

Reproduced from paragraph 66 of WIPO Standard ST.26.

(b) Location descriptors for nucleotide sequences only:

|Location descriptor type|Syntax|Description|
|---|---|---|
|A site between two adjoining nucleotides|x^y|Points to a site between two adjoining nucleotides, e.g., endonucleolytic cleavage site. The position numbers for the adjacent nucleotides are separated by a carat (^). The permitted formats for this descriptor are x^x+1 (for example 55^56), or, for circular nucleotides, x^1, where "x" is the full length of the molecule, i.e. 1000^1 for circular molecule with length 1000.|

Reproduced from paragraph 66 of WIPO Standard ST.26.

(c) Location descriptors for amino acid sequences only:

|Location descriptor type|Syntax|Description|
|---|---|---|
|Residue numbers joined by an intrachain cross-link|x. .y|Points to amino acids joined by an intrachain linkage when used with a feature that indicates an intrachain cross-link, such as "CROSSLNK" or "DISULFID".|

Reproduced from paragraph 66 of WIPO Standard ST.26.

WIPO Standard ST.26 specifies that the INSDFeature_location element of nucleotide sequences may contain one or more location operators. A location operator is a prefix to either one location descriptor or a combination of location descriptors corresponding to a single but discontinuous feature, and specifies where the location corresponding to the feature on the indicated sequence is found or how the feature is constructed. A list of location operators is provided in the table below with their descriptions. Location operators can be used for nucleotides only.

|Location syntax|Location description|
|---|---|
|join (location, location ,..., location)|The indicated locations are joined (placed end-to-end) to form one contiguous sequence.|
|order (location, location,...,location)|The elements are found in the specified order but nothing is implied about whether joining those elements is reasonable.|
|complement (location)|Indicates that the feature is located on the strand complementary to the sequence span specified by the location descriptor, when read in the 5’ to 3’ direction or in the direction that mimics 5’ to 3’ direction.|

Reproduced from paragraph 67 of WIPO Standard ST.26.

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 68, specifies that the join and order location operators require that at least two comma-separated location descriptors be provided. Location descriptors involving sites between two adjacent residues, i.e. x^y, must not be used within a join or order combination of locations. Use of the join location operator implies that the residues described by the location descriptors are physically brought into contact by biological processes (for example, the exons that contribute to a coding region feature).

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 69, specifies that the location operator "complement" can be used in combination with either "join" or "order" within the same location. Combinations of "join" and "order" within the same location must not be used. See paragraph 70, examples of WIPO Standard ST.26.

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 71, specifies that in an XML instance of a "Sequence Listing XML" , the characters "<" and ">" in a location descriptor must be replaced by the appropriate predefined entities, "&lt;" and "&gt;", respectively (see **[MPEP § 2413.01(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1f_13e1b_33a.html)** regarding the predefined entities).

## V.    **FEATURE QUALIFIERS**

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 72, specifies that qualifiers are used to supply information about features in addition to that conveyed by the feature key and feature location. There are three types of value formats to accommodate different types of information conveyed by qualifiers, namely:

- (a) free text (see **[MPEP §§ 2413.01(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1f_1b279_ed.html)**, subsection IX and **[2413.01(h)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1f_1b2e2_266.html)**, for more detail about "free text");
- (b) controlled vocabulary or enumerated values (e.g., a number or date); and
- (c) sequences.

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 73, specifies that Section 6 of Annex I contains the exclusive listing of qualifiers and their specified value formats, if any, for each nucleotide sequence feature key and Section 8 of Annex I contains the exclusive listing of qualifiers and their specified value formats, if any, for each amino acid sequence feature key.

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 74, specifies that any sequence encompassed by **[37 CFR 1.831(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1bdc8_2b8.html##ar_it_35d57_211e4_8c)**  (see **[MPEP § 2412.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35dcb_22374_144.html)**) that is provided as a qualifier value must be separately included in the "Sequence Listing XML" and assigned its own sequence identifier as described in **[MPEP § 2412.05(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1e_20ff6_1f.html)**.

## VI.    **MANDATORY FEATURE QUALIFIERS**

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 75, specifies that one mandatory feature key, i.e., "source" requires two mandatory qualifiers, "organism" and "mol_type." Some optional feature keys also require mandatory qualifiers. See Annex I of WIPO Standard ST.26, Sections 5 and 7, for listings of feature keys with mandatory qualifiers.

## VII.    **QUALIFIER ELEMENTS**

WIPO Standard ST.26 specifies that the element INSDFeature_quals contains one or more INSDQualifier elements. Each INSDQualifier element represents a single qualifier and consists of three dependent elements and one optional attribute, as shown below:

|Element/Attribute|Description|Mandatory/Optional|
|---|---|---|
|INSDQualifier_name|Name of the qualifier (see Annex I, Sections 6 and 8).|Mandatory|
|INSDQualifier_value|Value of the qualifier, if any, in the specified format (see Annex I, Sections 6 and 8) and composed in the characters as set forth in paragraph 40(b).|Mandatory, when specified (see paragraph 87 and Annex I, Sections 6 and 8)|
|NonEnglishQualifier_value|Value of the qualifier, if any, in the specified format (see Annex I, Sections 6 and 8) and composed in the characters as set forth in paragraph 40(a).|Mandatory, when specified (see paragraph 87 and Annex I, Sections 6 and 8)|
|NonEnglishQualifier_value|Value of the qualifier, if any, in the specified format (see Annex I, Sections 6 and 8) and composed in the characters as set forth in paragraph 40(a).|Mandatory, when specified (see paragraph 87 and Annex I, Sections 6 and 8)|
|id|A qualifier with a language-dependent free text value may be uniquely identified by using the optional XML attribute 'id' in the element INSDQualifier (see paragraph 87(d)). The value of the 'id' attribute must start with the letter 'q' and continue with any positive integer. The value of an 'id' attribute must be unique to one INSDQualifier element, i.e. the attribute value must only be used once in a sequence listing file.|Optional|

Reproduced from paragraph 76 of WIPO Standard ST.26.

## VIII.    **ORGANISM AND MOL_TYPE QUALIFIERS**

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 77, specifies that the organism qualifier, i.e., "organism" for nucleotide sequences (See Table 5: List of Qualifier Values for Nucleotide Sequences with Language-Dependent Free-Text Values reproduced in **[MPEP § 2413.01(h)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1f_1b2e2_266.html)**, Annex I, section 6, of WIPO Standard ST.26) and "organism" for amino acid sequences (see Table 6: List of Qualifiers for Amino Acid Sequences with Language-Dependent Free Text Values reproduced in **[MPEP § 2413.01(h)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1f_1b2e2_266.html)**, Annex I, section 6, of WIPO Standard ST.26) must disclose the source, i.e., a single organism or origin, of the sequence. Organism designations should be selected from a taxonomy database.

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 78, specifies that if the sequence is naturally occurring and the source organism has a Latin genus and species designation, that designation must be used as the qualifier value. The preferred English common name may be specified using the qualifier "note" for nucleotide sequences and amino acid sequences, but must not be used in the organism qualifier value.

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 80, specifies that if the sequence is naturally occurring and the source organism has a known Latin genus, but the species is unspecified or unidentified, then the organism qualifier value must indicate the Latin genus followed by "sp".

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 81, specifies that if the sequence is naturally occurring, but the Latin organism genus and species designation is unknown, then the organism qualifier value must be indicated as "unidentified". Any known taxonomic information should be indicated in the qualifier "note" for nucleotide sequences and the qualifier "note" for amino acid sequences.

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 82, specifies that if the sequence is naturally occurring and the source organism does not have a Latin genus and species designation, such as a virus, then another acceptable scientific name (e.g., "Canine adenovirus type 2") must be used as the organism qualifier value.

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 83, specifies that if the sequence is not naturally occurring, the organism qualifier value must be indicated as "synthetic construct." Further information with respect to the way the sequence was generated may be specified using the qualifier "note" for nucleotide sequences and the qualifier "note" for amino acid sequences.

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 84, specifies that the "mol_type" qualifier for nucleotide sequences and "mol_type" qualifier for amino acid sequences must disclose the type of molecule represented in the sequence. These qualifiers are distinct from the element INSDSeq_moltype discussed above where INSDSeq_moltype for nucleotide sequences, including nucleotide analogue sequences must be indicated as DNA or RNA, and for amino acid sequences, must be indicated as AA:

- (1) For a nucleotide sequence, the "mol_type" qualifier value must be one of the following: "genomic DNA", "genomic RNA", "mRNA", "tRNA", "rRNA", "other RNA", "other DNA", "transcribed RNA", "viral cRNA", "unassigned DNA", or "unassigned RNA". If the sequence is not naturally occurring, i.e. the value of the "organism" qualifier is "synthetic construct", the "mol_type" qualifier value must be either "other RNA" or "other DNA";
- (2) For an amino acid sequence, the "mol_type" qualifier value is "protein."

## IX.    **FREE TEXT**

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 85, specifies that "free text" is a type of value format for certain qualifiers presented in the form of a descriptive text phrase or other specified format (see **[MPEP § 2413.01(h)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1f_1b2e2_266.html)** for the definition of "free text" and see Annex I of WIPO Standard ST.26 for controlled vocabulary).

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 86, specifies that the use of free text must be limited to a few short terms indispensable for the understanding of a characteristic of the sequence. For each qualifier other than the "translation" qualifier, the free text must not exceed 1000 characters.

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 87, specifies that language-dependent free text is the free text value of certain qualifiers that is language-dependent in that it may require translation for international, national, or regional procedures. Qualifiers for nucleotide sequences with a language-dependent free text value format are identified in Annex I, Table 5: List of Qualifiers with Language-Dependent FreeText Values for Nucleotide Sequences (reproduced in **[MPEP § 2413.01(h)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1f_1b2e2_266.html)**). Qualifiers for amino acid sequences with a language-dependent free text value format are identified in Annex I, Table 6: List of Qualifiers with Language-Dependent Free Text Values for Amino Acid Sequences (reproduced in **[MPEP § 2413.01(h)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1f_1b2e2_266.html)**).

## X.    **CODING SEQUENCES**

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 89, specifies that the "CDS" feature key may be used to identify coding sequences, i.e., sequences of nucleotides which correspond to the sequence of amino acids in a protein and the stop codon. The location of the "CDS" feature in the mandatory element INSDFeature_location must include the stop codon.

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 90, specifies that the "transl_table" and "translation" qualifiers may be used with the "CDS" feature key (see Annex I of WIPO Standard ST.26). Where the "transl_table" qualifier is not used, the use of the Standard Code Table (see Annex I, Section 9, Table 7 of WIPO Standard ST.26) is assumed.

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 91, specifies that the "transl_except" qualifier must be used with the "CDS" feature key and the "translation" qualifier to identify a codon that encodes either pyrrolysine or selenocysteine.

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 92, specifies that an amino acid sequence encoded by the coding sequence and disclosed in a "translation" qualifier that is encompassed by the description of sequences found in **[MPEP § 2412.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35dcb_22374_144.html)** must be included in the sequence listing and assigned its own sequence identifier. The sequence identifier assigned to the amino acid sequence must be provided as the value in the qualifier "protein_id" with the "CDS" feature key. The "organism" qualifier of the "source" feature key for the amino acid sequence must be identical to that of its coding sequence.

## XI.    **VARIANTS**

**[MPEP § 2412.05(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1e_2102d_21e.html)** provides information about representation and inclusion of variants

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 93, specifies that a primary sequence and any variant of that sequence, each disclosed by enumeration of its residues and encompassed by the description of sequences found in **[MPEP § 2412.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35dcb_22374_144.html)** must each be included in the sequence listing and assigned its own sequence identifier.

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 94, specifies that any variant sequence, disclosed as a single sequence with enumerated alternative residues at one or more positions, must be included in the sequence listing and should be represented by a single sequence, wherein the enumerated alternative residues are represented by the most restrictive ambiguity symbol. See **[MPEP § 2412.05(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1e_21027_28e.html)**, subsection II, for more information regarding representing alternative nucleotide residues and **[MPEP § 2412.05(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1e_2102f_330.html)**, subsection II, for more information regarding representing alternative amino acid residues.

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 95, specifies that any variant sequence, disclosed only by reference to deletion(s), insertion(s), or substitution(s) in a primary sequence in the sequence listing, should be included in the sequence listing. Where included in the sequence listing, such a variant sequence:

- (a) may be represented by annotation of the primary sequence, where it contains variation(s) at a single location or multiple distinct locations and the occurrence of those variations are independent;
- (b) should be represented as a separate sequence and assigned its own sequence identifier, where it contains variations at multiple distinct locations and the occurrence of those variations are interdependent; and
- (c) must be represented as a separate sequence and assigned its own sequence identifier, where it contains an inserted or substituted sequence that contains in excess of 1000 residues (see WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 86).

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 96, specifies the proper use of feature keys and qualifiers for nucleic acid and amino acid sequence variants from the table List of Feature Keys and Qualifiers (reproduced in **[MPEP § 2412.05(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1e_2102d_21e.html)**).

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 97, specifies that annotation of a sequence for a specific variant must include a feature key and qualifier, as indicated in the table in **[MPEP § 2412.05(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1e_2102d_21e.html)**, and the feature location. The value for the "replace" qualifier must be only a single alternative nucleotide or nucleotide sequence using only the symbols in set forth Table 1: List of Nucleotides Symbols (see **[MPEP § 2413.01(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1f_13e1b_33a.html)**), or empty. A listing of alternative residues may be provided as the value in the "note" qualifier. In particular, a listing of alternative amino acids must be provided as the value in the "note" qualifier where "X" is used in a sequence, and represents a value other than "any one of ‘A’, ‘R’, ‘N’, ‘D’, ‘C’, ‘Q’, ‘E’, ‘G’, ‘H’, ‘I’, ‘L’, ‘K’, ‘M’, ‘F’, ‘P’, ‘O’, ‘S’, ‘U’, ‘T’, ‘W’, ‘Y’, or ‘V.’" A deletion must be represented by an empty qualifier value for the "replace" qualifier or by an indication in the "note" qualifier that the residue may be deleted. An inserted or substituted residue(s) must be provided in the "replace" or "note" qualifier. The value format for the "replace" and "note" qualifiers is free text and must not exceed 1000 characters. See below for sequences encompassed by the definition in **[MPEP § 2412.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35dcb_22374_144.html)** that are provided as an insertion or a substitution in a qualifier value.

WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 98, specifies that the symbols set forth in Tables 1 to 4 of Annex I, reproduced in **[MPEP §§ 2412.03(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1e_1b8a1_1a6.html)**, **[2412.03(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1e_1b8b3_257.html)**, and **[2412.05(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1e_21027_28e.html)**, subsection III, should be used to represent variant residues where appropriate. For the "note" qualifier, where the variant residue is a modified residue not set forth in Tables 2 or 4 the complete unabbreviated name of the modified residue must be provided as the qualifier value. Modified residues must be further described in a feature table as described in **[MPEP § 2412.05(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1e_21027_28e.html)**, subsection III for modified nucleotides and **[MPEP § 2412.05(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1e_2102f_330.html)**, subsection III, for modified amino acids.

Qualifiers with a language-dependent free text values for amino acid sequences are identified below:

|Section|Language-Dependent Free Text Qualifier|
|---|---|
|8.2|note|
|8.3|organism|

Reproduced from Table 6 of WIPO Standard ST.26, Annex I, Section 8.

- (a) Language-dependent free text must be presented in the INSDQualifier_value element in English, or in the NonEnglishQualifier_value element in a language other than English, or in both elements. Note that if an organism name is a Latin genus and species name, no translation is required. Technical terms and proper names originating from non-English words that are used internationally are considered English for the purpose of the value of the INSDQualifier_value element (e.g., ‘in vitro’, ‘in vivo’).
- (b) If a NonEnglishQualifier_value element is present in a sequence listing, the appropriate language code (see WIPO Standard ST.26 at paragraph 9, which references the International Standard ISO 639-1:2002) must be indicated in the nonEnglishFreeTextLanguageCode attribute in the root element (see List of File Attributes reproduced in **[MPEP § 2413.01(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1f_16579_61.html)**). All NonEnglishQualifier_value elements in a single sequence listing must have values in the language indicated in the nonEnglishFreeTextLanguageCode attribute. The NonEnglishQualifier_value element is permitted only for qualifiers that have a language-dependent free text value format.
- (c) Where NonEnglishQualifier_value and INSDQualifier_value are both present for a single qualifier, the information contained in the two elements must be equivalent. One of the following conditions must be true: NonEnglishQualifier_value contains a translation of the value of INSDQualifier_value; or, INSDQualifier_value contains a translation of the value of NonEnglishQualifier_value; or, both elements contain a translation of the qualifier value from the language specified in the originalFreeTextLanguageCode attribute (see List of File Attributes reproduced in **[MPEP § 2413.01(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1f_16579_61.html)**).
- (d) For qualifiers with a language-dependent free text value, the INSDQualifier element may include an optional attribute _id._ The value of this attribute must be in the format "q" followed by a positive integer, e.g. "q23", and must be unique to one INSDQualifier element, i.e. the attribute value must only be used once in a "Sequence Listing XML" file (WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 87).

The element InventionTitle described in the table of elements of the general information part (reproduced in **[MPEP § 2413.01(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1f_19c83_3c9.html)** from WIPO Standard ST.26, paragraph 45) as a required element of the "general information" part of the "Sequence Listing XML" must be in the language of filing. It is possible for an applicant to provide more than one InventionTitle element of the general information part in more than one language. However, when the USPTO is the Receiving Office (RO/US) for an international application, the English language is required for the InventionTitle element and also for language-dependent free text of the "Sequence Listing XML." (See **[MPEP § 2413.01(h)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1f_1b2e2_266.html)** for more information about language-dependent free text.) If non-English language is presented to RO/US for a "Sequence Listing XML," then RO/US will transfer the international application to the International Bureau, under **[PCT Rule 19.4](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e368498.html##d0e368587)**.

- *****
    

For submission of a "Sequence Listing XML" that is 100MB in size or less, the preferred method of submission is via the USPTO patent electronic filing system. Only the Patent Center system of the USPTO patent electronic filing system is capable of accepting .xml files. If the "Sequence Listing XML" is larger than 100MB in size, then applicant may submit the .xml file on physical media using read-only optical discs (CDs or DVDs). "Sequence Listing XML" submissions on discs may be compressed if the resulting compressed file is non-self-extracting.

The USPTO patent electronic filing system will prohibit an applicant from submitting both a "Sequence Listing XML" (a sequence listing that conforms to WIPO Standard ST.26 as implemented in **[37 CFR 1.831](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1bdc8_2b8.html)**  through **[1.835](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1be4d_1f4.html)** ) and a "Sequence Listing" (a sequence listing that conforms to ST.25 as implemented in **[37 CFR 1.821](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html)**  through **[1.825](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e334511.html)** ) in the same submission. Filing a "Sequence Listing" in a 35 U.S.C. 111(a) application having a filing date on or after July 1, 2022, will result in a notice from the Office of Patent Application Processing (OPAP) informing applicant that the submission fails to comply with **[37 CFR 1.831](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1bdc8_2b8.html)**  through **[1.834](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1be3b_1cf.html)**  and will require submission of a "Sequence Listing XML." See **[MPEP § 2415.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35e1f_25cd9_1c2.html)** for addressing improper submission of a "Sequence Listing" that complies with **[37 CFR 1.821](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html)** -**[1.824](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e334418.html)**  where a "Sequence Listing XML" that complies with **[37 CFR 1.831](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1bdc8_2b8.html)** -**[1.834](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1be3b_1cf.html)**  is required in a national nonprovisional application.

To facilitate administrative processing of all papers and read-only optical discs associated with sequence rule compliance, all read-only optical discs, fees, and papers accompanying them filed in the Office should be marked "Mail Stop SEQUENCE." Correspondence relating to the submission of a "Sequence Listing XML" may also be hand-delivered to the Customer Service Window. In cases of hand delivery to the Customer Service Window, the read-only optical disc enclosed in a hard case should be placed in a protective mailer. The use of staples and clips, if any, should be confined to carefully attaching the protective mailer to the submitted papers without contact or compression of the media. The labeling requirements of **[37 CFR 1.52(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e318327.html##d0e318519)**  and including the application number (if known), apply to all read-only optical disc submissions. For submission of a "Sequence Listing XML" larger than 100MB in size in a new application, it is recommended that the user file the application without the "Sequence Listing XML" using the USPTO patent electronic filing system to obtain the application number, and then file the "Sequence Listing XML" on read-only optical disc(s) in accordance with **[37 CFR 1.52(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e318327.html##d0e318519)**  on the same day by using Priority Mail Express® from the USPS in accordance with **[37 CFR 1.10](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e313951.html)**, or hand delivery, in order to secure the same filing date for all parts of the application. In no situations should additional or complimentary electronic copies be delivered to examiners or other Office personnel.

- - (c)(1) Unless paragraph (c)(2) of this section applies, when the "Sequence Listing XML" required by § **[1.831(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1bdc8_2b8.html##ar_it_35d57_211ca_219)**  is submitted in XML file format via the USPTO patent electronic filing system or on a read-only optical disc (in compliance with § **[1.52(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e352960.html##d0e353056)** ), then the specification must contain a statement in a separate paragraph (_see_ § **[1.77(b)(5)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e320555.html##d0e320614)** ) that incorporates by reference the material in the XML file identifying:
        - (i) The name of the file;
        - (ii) The date of creation; and
        - (iii) The size of the file in bytes; or

- (c) The specification of a complete application, filed on the application filing date, with a "Sequence Listing XML" as required under § **[1.831(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1bdc8_2b8.html##ar_it_35d57_211ca_219)**, without an incorporation by reference of the material contained in the "Sequence Listing XML" file, must be amended to include a separate paragraph incorporating by reference the material contained in the "Sequence Listing XML" file, in accordance with § **[1.77(b)(5)(ii)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_it_337f0_1696e_112.html)**, except for international applications.
- *****
    

Since the "Sequence Listing XML" is not the text of the specification, but rather is sequence data in an XML file format, an incorporation by reference statement is needed to ensure that the content of the "Sequence Listing XML," submitted to the USPTO as an XML file, is considered part of the disclosure capable of providing **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**  support for the disclosure and any claims relating to nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences. The incorporation by reference statement identifies: (i) the name of the file; (ii) the date of creation of the file; and (iii) the size of the file in bytes Note that this requirement pertaining to applicant submission of a "Sequence Listing XML" does not apply to a sequence listing that is part of an international application and communicated to the USPTO under PCT Article 20, for a national phase application.

The incorporation by reference statement of the material in an .xml file is required to be part of the specification so it is clear to the Office, the printer, and the public that the application as originally filed includes material on an .xml file. However, for international applications during the international phase, where a "Sequence Listing XML" is submitted via the USPTO patent electronic filing system or on read-only optical disc, no such incorporation by reference statement is required.

If an applicant submits a "Sequence Listing XML" with the complete specification but fails to include the required incorporation by reference paragraph, a notice can be issued by pre-examination requiring the incorporation by reference paragraph in the context of a substitute specification under 37 CFR 1.125. Similarly, the examiner could require applicant to amend the specification to include an incorporation by reference paragraph of the "Sequence Listing XML" file. See also form paragraph **[24.24.26](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//fp24.24.26.html)**.

# 2413.05    Presumptions Regarding Compliance [R-01.2024]

_[Editor Note: This section is applicable to all applications with a filing date, or, for national phase applications, an international filing date, on or after July 1, 2022, having disclosure of one or more nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences as defined in **[37 CFR 1.831(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1bdc8_2b8.html##ar_it_35d57_211e4_8c)**.]_

Neither the presence nor absence of information which is not required under the sequence rules will create a presumption that such information is necessary to satisfy any of the requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302824912.html)**. Further, the grant of a patent on an application that is subject to **[37 CFR 1.831](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1bdc8_2b8.html)**  through **[37 CFR 1.835](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1be4d_1f4.html)**  constitutes a presumption that the granted patent complies with the requirements of these rules.

Initial review by the pre-examination staff at the USPTO checks for compliance with formal matters. In order to ensure that an application is ready for examination, pre-examination staff check that applications containing disclosures of nucleotides and/or amino acid sequences have complied with the sequence listing rules. This means that for applications having a filing date on or after July 1, 2022, containing such sequence disclosures, a "Sequence Listing XML" must be of record and if not, applicant will be notified of such deficiency and provided instructions for responding. Adding a "Sequence Listing XML" where one was not previously filed must conform with the requirements of **[37 CFR 1.835(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1be4d_1f4.html##ar_it_35d57_22926_379)**.

#### _37 C.F.R. 1.835  Amendment to add or replace a "Sequence Listing XML" in patent applications filed on or after July 1, 2022._

- (a) Any amendment to a patent application adding an initial submission of a "Sequence Listing XML" as required by § **[1.831(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1bdc8_2b8.html##ar_it_35d57_211ca_219)**  after the application filing date must include:
    - (1) A "Sequence Listing XML" in accordance with §§ **[1.831](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1bdc8_2b8.html)**  through **[1.834](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1be3b_1cf.html)**, submitted as an XML file:
        - (i) Via the USPTO patent electronic filing system; or
        - (ii) On a read-only optical disc, in compliance with § **[1.52(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e352960.html##d0e353056)**;
    - (2) A request to amend the specification to include an incorporation by reference statement of the material in the "Sequence Listing XML" file, identifying the name of the file, the date of creation, and the size of the file in bytes (_see_ § **[1.77(b)(5)(ii)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_it_337f0_1696e_112.html)** ), except when submitted to the United States International Preliminary Examining Authority for an international application;
    - (3) A statement that indicates the basis for the amendment, with specific references to particular parts of the application as originally filed (specification, claims, drawings) for all sequence data in the "Sequence Listing XML"; and
    - (4) A statement that the "Sequence Listing XML" includes no new matter.
- *****
    

Part of the pre-examination process as well as initial review by the examiner involves identifying whether an application that discloses nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences requires submission of a "Sequence Listing XML," and if so, if it contains a compliant "Sequence Listing XML." If pre-examination staff identifies that a "Sequence Listing XML" is required but missing or that compliance with **[37 CFR 1.831](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1bdc8_2b8.html)**  - **[1.835](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1be4d_1f4.html)**  is lacking, a notice indicating the deficiencies will be issued to the applicant. Similarly, upon having a new application placed on the examiner’s docket, the examiner can assess whether a disclosure of nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences in the application requires a "Sequence Listing XML" to be submitted where one has not been submitted. The examiner can identify the requirement for a "Sequence Listing XML" on an "OPAP Routing Sheet" (Document Code "SEQREQ") and return the application to pre-examination for the mailing of a notice indicating the deficiencies.

Applicant's response to a notice or an Office Action requiring an initial "Sequence Listing XML" would involve providing the following:

- (1) A compliant "Sequence Listing XML" submitted as an XML file using either the USPTO patent electronic filing system (currently, XML files can only be submitted via Patent Center) or a read-only optical disc that is mailed or hand-delivered into the Office. If the size of "Sequence Listing XML" file exceeds the upload limit of Patent Center, then it must be submitted on read-only optical disc. (**[37 CFR 1.835(a)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1be4d_1f4.html##ar_it_35d57_2292f_95)** );
- (2) An amendment to the specification to incorporate by reference the material in the "Sequence Listing XML" by reciting in a separate paragraph of the specification the name of the file, the date of creation, and the size of the file in bytes (**[37 CFR 1.835(a)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1be4d_1f4.html##ar_it_35d57_22952_1ae)**  and **[37 CFR 1.835(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1be4d_1f4.html##ar_it_35d57_22a0e_20e)** );
- (3) A statement identifying the basis for the added "Sequence Listing XML," which would include, e.g., paragraphs of the originally filed specification or sheets of the drawings where a sequence is disclosed, identifying each sequence that is part of the "Sequence Listing XML" (**[37 CFR 1.835(a)(3)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1be4d_1f4.html##ar_it_35d57_2295b_75)** ); and
- (4) A statement that no new matter is introduced by the content of the "Sequence Listing XML" (**[37 CFR 1.835(a)(4)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1be4d_1f4.html##ar_it_35d57_22990_3e6)** ).

Part of the pre-examination process as well as initial review by the examiner involves identifying whether an application that discloses nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences contains a compliant "Sequence Listing XML." If pre-examination staff identifies that a previously submitted "Sequence Listing XML" contains errors and/or the application fails to comply with **[37 CFR 1.831](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1bdc8_2b8.html)**  - **[1.834](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1be3b_1cf.html)**, a notice indicating the deficiencies will be issued to the applicant. Similarly, upon having a new application placed on the examiner’s docket, the examiner can identify errors in any "Sequence Listing XML" and/or instances of noncompliance with **[37 CFR 1.831](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1bdc8_2b8.html)**  - **[1.834](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1be3b_1cf.html)**  that might not have been identified by pre-examination staff. The examiner can identify the outstanding requirements on a "OPAP Routing Sheet" (Document Code "SEQREQ") and return the application to pre-examination status for the mailing of a notice indicating the deficiencies.

Applicant response to a notice or an Office action requiring a replacement "Sequence Listing XML" would involve submitting the following:

- (1) A compliant replacement "Sequence Listing XML" submitted as an XML file containing the entire "Sequence Listing XML," including any additions, deletions, or replacements of sequence information, using either the USPTO patent electronic filing system (currently, XML files can only be submitted via Patent Center) or a read-only optical disc that is mailed or hand-delivered into the Office. If the size of "Sequence Listing XML" file exceeds the upload limit of Patent Center, then it must be submitted on read-only optical disc (**[37 CFR 1.835(b)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1be4d_1f4.html##ar_it_35d57_229ac_195)** );

Similar to the rules of practice regarding provisional applications filed before July 1, 2022, that contain disclosures of nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences, provisional applications filed on or after July 1, 2022, are not required to contain a separate compliant sequence listing. However, if an applicant chooses to file a separate sequence listing in an application filed on or after July 1, 2022, the submission must be by way of a "Sequence Listing XML" that is compliant with **[37 CFR 1.831](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1bdc8_2b8.html)**  - **[1.834](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1be3b_1cf.html)**. Provisional applications cannot be amended, so if a provisional application contains a non-compliant "Sequence Listing XML" no notice relating to the requirements will be mailed in the application.

# 2415.03    Improper Submissions of "Sequence Listing" under 1.821(c) When a "Sequence Listing XML" was Required [R-01.2024]

_[Editor Note: This section is applicable to all applications with a filing date, or, for national phase applications, an international filing date, on or after July 1, 2022, having disclosure of one or more nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences as defined in **[37 CFR 1.831(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1bdc8_2b8.html##ar_it_35d57_211e4_8c)**.]_

While implementing regulations and procedures for WIPO Standard ST.26, the USPTO recognized that an applicant might erroneously provide a "Sequence Listing" in ASCII plain text file format even though a "Sequence Listing XML" is required. Therefore, in the rare circumstance in which a "Sequence Listing" .txt file is submitted in an application filed on or after July 1, 2022, the "Sequence Listing" present in the Office file wrapper of the application at issue may be used to provide support for the submission of a compliant "Sequence Listing XML." The applicant’s reliance on the "Sequence Listing" to support the compliant "Sequence Listing XML" would be by way of the safeguard under **[37 CFR 1.57(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//plt_d0e319490.html##ar_d22415_18920_3a0)**, if an earlier filed application contains a proper "Sequence Listing" in .txt file format, or via a grantable petition under **[37 CFR 1.182](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e324988.html)**, only if the application does not have a proper benefit or priority claim present on the filing date to an earlier filed application.

An applicant may rely on the provisions in **[37 CFR 1.57(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//plt_d0e319490.html##ar_d22415_18920_3a0)**, as described in the **[MPEP § 217](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch200_d1ff72_27f9d_2c9.html)**, to support the required "Sequence Listing XML" as an "inadvertently omitted portion of the specification or drawing(s)."

# 2417    Helpful Hints for Sequence Rules Compliance under WIPO Standard ST.26 [R-01.2024]

_[Editor Note: This section is applicable to all applications with a filing date, or, for national phase applications, an international filing date, on or after July 1, 2022, having disclosure of one or more nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences as defined in **[37 CFR 1.831(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1bdc8_2b8.html##ar_it_35d57_211e4_8c)**.]_

The Office has the following non-exhaustive tips regarding sequence rules in compliance with WIPO Standard ST.26, as incorporated by reference in **[37 CFR 1.839](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1be8a_d8.html)**  and implemented by **[37 CFR 1.831](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1bdc8_2b8.html)** -**[1.835](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1be4d_1f4.html)**.

—Compliance is not required for establishing a filing date.

# 2418    WIPO Sequence Tool [R-01.2024]

_[Editor Note: This section is applicable to all applications with a filing date, or, for national phase applications, an international filing date, on or after July 1, 2022, having disclosure of one or more nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences as defined in **[37 CFR 1.831(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1bdc8_2b8.html##ar_it_35d57_211e4_8c)**.]_

To comply with rules based on WIPO Standard ST.26 (i.e., **[37 CFR 1.831](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1bdc8_2b8.html)**  - **[1.835](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1be4d_1f4.html)** ), patent applicants can generate a compliant "Sequence Listing XML" using WIPO Sequence, a desktop application developed by WIPO and adopted by WIPO member states, including the US. WIPO Sequence has two functions: An authoring function and a validation function. Patent applicants are able to author and validate their "Sequence Listing XML" using WIPO Sequence to comply with the requirements of WIPO Standard ST.26. A "Sequence Listing XML" that passes validation by WIPO Sequence will be accepted by all the IPOs of the WIPO member states, although translation may be needed. Thus, the burden of generating a WIPO Standard ST.26 compliant sequence listing in XML file format that is acceptable across all WIPO member states will be significantly decreased for patent applicants under WIPO Standard ST.26. This tool is downloadable, free of charge, from the WIPO website. The current version of WIPO Sequence is accessible at **[www.wipo.int/standards/en/sequence/index.html](https://www.wipo.int/standards/en/sequence/index.html)**.

The first step to generate a new sequence listing using WIPO Sequence is to create a project. The user saves (authors) patent application data and biological sequence data in the project, validates the project to ensure all required sequence-associated information is present, and generates a "Sequence Listing XML" in compliance with **[37 CFR 1.831](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1bdc8_2b8.html)**  - **[1.834](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1be4d_1f4.html)**  (complying with WIPO Standard ST.26 in XML format). Information can be entered into a project manually, or data can be imported from a source file in one of a number of file types. WIPO Sequence can import data from other WIPO Standard ST.26 projects, WIPO Standard ST.26 XML sequence listings, WIPO Standard ST.25 sequence listing text files, raw data files, multi-sequence format files, and FASTA format files. The entry of sequence-associated data, such as feature keys, qualifiers, and organism names, are facilitated by their selection from drop-down lists, simplifying the creation of a sequence listing. Applicant and inventor names, as well as custom organism names, can be stored in WIPO Sequence for easy access from other projects. To facilitate the review of data entered into a project, WIPO Sequence can generate a "human-readable" version (a text version of the sequence data) of the "Sequence Listing XML." This human readable version must not be submitted in a patent application.

WIPO Sequence includes an integrated validation function that will alert users to most errors in a project (i.e., "Sequence Listing XML" data). The validation function generates a report that clearly lists every detected error, the location of the error, and the detected value of the error, along with a link to the sequence in question, thereby ensuring users can correct errors before generating a final "Sequence Listing XML." While the validation function will alert a user to most errors in a project or "Sequence Listing XML," there are a small number of errors that can be detected only by human review (for example, an inappropriate organism name). In those cases, the integrated validation function will list a "warning" in the validation report, reminding users of the applicable/relevant rule and urging them to check their input values before generating a final "Sequence Listing XML." The WIPO Sequence validation function can also be used to validate a "Sequence Listing XML" that was previously generated. As for validation of a project, the validation of a "Sequence Listing XML" generates a report that clearly lists every detected error, the location of the error, and the detected value of the error in the "Sequence Listing XML." It is highly recommended that a "Sequence Listing XML" produced by WIPO Sequence be validated following its generation.

To ensure that IPOs can validate applicant-submitted sequence listings generated with WIPO Sequence, WIPO developed a Standard ST.26 sequence listing validation tool, WIPO Sequence Validator. WIPO Sequence Validator is for use by IPOs to verify that filed sequence listings comply with WIPO Standard ST.26 . WIPO Sequence Validator is synchronized with the validation function in the WIPO Sequence tool such that WIPO Sequence Validator applies the same validation rules as WIPO Sequence. The USPTO has integrated WIPO Sequence Validator into its internal IT systems (i.e., CRFValidator). Therefore, filers will have a greater level of confidence that a "Sequence Listing XML" validated by WIPO Sequence will comply with the USPTO rules for a "Sequence Listing XML" (**[37 CFR 1.831](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1bdc8_2b8.html)**  through **[1.835](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1be4d_1f4.html)** ) and be accepted.

A "Sequence Listing" in WIPO Standard ST.25 format cannot automatically be converted into WIPO Standard ST.26 format primarily because certain data elements required for a "Sequence Listing XML" compliant with WIPO Standard ST.26 are not present in WIPO Standard ST.25 sequence listing. Therefore, conversion of a "Sequence Listing" in WIPO Standard ST.25 format to WIPO Standard ST.26 format necessarily requires additional input from the applicant. WIPO Sequence, supplemented by significant guidance in Annex VI and Annex VII of WIPO Standard ST.26, will help applicants to accomplish this task without added or deleted subject matter. Users can import a WIPO Standard ST.25 "Sequence Listing" into a project, and WIPO Sequence automatically performs many of the necessary conversions. An Import Report is generated that alerts the user to all data conversions and lists all sequence entries that require additional input. In response to concerns raised regarding the USPTO’s requests for comments in 2012 and 2016, the USPTO, in conjunction with WIPO, developed Annex VII to provide detailed guidance to help applicants avoid added or deleted subject matter when converting a "Sequence Listing" in WIPO Standard ST.25 format into a WIPO Standard ST.26 "Sequence Listing XML" format.

A sample sequence listing (XML file) specimen can be found in WIPO Standard ST.26, Annex III and at **[www.wipo.int/standards/en/xml_material/st26/ st26-annex-iii-sequence-listing-specimen.xml](http://www.wipo.int/standards/en/xml_material/st26/st26-annex-iii-sequence-listing-specimen.xml)**.

# 2419    Publishing of Patent Grants and Patent Application Publications with a "Sequence Listing XML" [R-01.2024]

_[Editor Note: This section is applicable to all applications with a filing date, or, for national phase applications, an international filing date, on or after July 1, 2022, having disclosure of one or more nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences as defined in **[37 CFR 1.831(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1bdc8_2b8.html##ar_it_35d57_211e4_8c)**.]_

At the USPTO, the Sequence Listing Information Control (SLIC) system is responsible for processing of a "Sequence Listing XML" and exporting the sequence data for publication and grant. Because a "Sequence Listing XML" exists only in .xml file format, the USPTO uses a style sheet to transform a "Sequence Listing XML" file of less than 1 GB in size into an ASCII text file which will be used to present the sequence information in a format that is more easily read.

# 2419.01    Patent Grants and Patent Application Publications Containing a Non-Lengthy "Sequence Listing XML" [R-01.2024]

_[Editor Note: This section is applicable to all applications with a filing date, or, for national phase applications, an international filing date, on or after July 1, 2022, having disclosure of one or more nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences as defined in **[37 CFR 1.831(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1bdc8_2b8.html##ar_it_35d57_211e4_8c)**.]_

Upon transformation of the .xml file using the style sheet to an ASCII text file, any ASCII text file produced by the USPTO that is under 600KB will be published as part of the specification.

# 2419.02    Patent Grants and Patent Application Publications Containing a Lengthy "Sequence Listing XML" [R-01.2024]

_[Editor Note: This section is applicable to all applications with a filing date, or, for national phase applications, an international filing date, on or after July 1, 2022, having disclosure of one or more nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences as defined in **[37 CFR 1.831(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1bdc8_2b8.html##ar_it_35d57_211e4_8c)**.]_

Upon transformation of the .xml file using the style sheet to an ASCII text file, any ASCII text file produced by the USPTO that is 600KB or more, but under 1GB will be processed for separate publication on Publication Site for Issued and Published Sequences (PSIPS). In place of such lengthy "Sequence Listing", the patent or patent application publication specification will show a page-wide SEQUENCE LISTING statement similar to the example shown below:

SEQUENCE LISTING

The patent contains a lengthy "Sequence Listing" section. A copy of the "Sequence Listing" is available in electronic form from the USPTO website (**[https://seqdata.uspto.gov](https://seqdata.uspto.gov/)** ). An electronic copy of the "Sequence Listing" will also be available from the USPTO upon request and payment of the fee set forth in **[37 CFR 1.19(b)(3)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e315991.html##d0e316158)**.

# 2419.03    Patent Grants and Patent Application Publications Containing a "Sequence Listing XML" of 1GB or Larger [R-01.2024]

_[Editor Note: This section is applicable to all applications with a filing date, or, for national phase applications, an international filing date, on or after July 1, 2022, having disclosure of one or more nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences as defined in **[37 CFR 1.831(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1bdc8_2b8.html##ar_it_35d57_211e4_8c)**.]_

Where a "Sequence Listing XML" is 1GB or larger, exception processing for the listing will be required. That is, the "Sequence Listing XML" cannot be published as part of the specification, nor can it be published on PSIPS, instead it will be published on the USPTO Bulk Data Storage System (BDSS). No transformation of the .xml file into an ASCII text file will occur. In place of the 1GB or larger "Sequence Listing XML," the patent or patent application publication specification will show the page-wide statement similar to the one shown below:

The sequence rules define a set of symbols and procedures that are both mandatory and the only way that an applicant is permitted to describe information in the "Sequence Listing" about a nucleotide or amino acid sequence that falls within the definitions used in the rules. Thus, **[37 CFR 1.821](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html)**  defines a "sequence" and a "Sequence Listing" for the purpose of the rules, the requirements for specific symbols, and formats for the "Sequence Listing", the requirement for a computer readable form (CRF) of the "Sequence Listing" and the deadlines for complying with the requirements. **[37 CFR 1.822](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333753.html)**  to **[37 CFR 1.824](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e334418.html)**  set forth detailed descriptions of the requirements that are mandatory for the presentation of sequence data, and **[37 CFR 1.825](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e334511.html)**  sets forth procedures that are available to an applicant in the event that amendments to add or replace a "Sequence Listing", including any necessary CRF of the "Sequence Listing" become necessary.

The sequence rules embrace all unbranched nucleotide sequences with ten or more nucleotide bases and all unbranched, non-D amino acid sequences with four or more amino acids, provided that there are at least 10 "specifically defined" nucleotides or 4 "specifically defined" nucleotides or amino acids. The rules apply to all sequences in a given application, whether claimed or not. All such sequences are relevant for the purposes of building a comprehensive database and properly assessing prior art. It is therefore essential that all sequences, whether only disclosed or also claimed, be included in the database.

#### _37 C.F.R. 1.821   Nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence disclosures in patent applications._

- (a) Nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences, as used in §§ **[1.821](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html)**  through **[1.825](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e334511.html)**, are interpreted to mean an unbranched sequence of 4 or more amino acids or an unbranched sequence of 10 or more nucleotides. Branched sequences are specifically excluded from this definition. Sequences with fewer than four specifically defined nucleotides or amino acids are specifically excluded from this section. "Specifically defined" means those amino acids other than "Xaa" and those nucleotide bases other than "n," defined in accordance with Appendices A through F to this subpart. Nucleotides and amino acids are further defined as follows:
    - (1) _Nucleotides:_ Nucleotides are intended to embrace only those nucleotides that can be represented using the symbols set forth in Appendix A to this subpart. Modifications (_e.g.,_ methylated bases) may be described as set forth in Appendix B to this subpart but shall not be shown explicitly in the nucleotide sequence.
    - (2) _Amino acids:_ Amino acids are those L-amino acids commonly found in naturally occurring proteins and are listed in appendix C to this subpart. Those amino acid sequences containing D-amino acids are not intended to be embraced by this definition. Any amino acid sequence that contains post-translationally modified amino acids may be described as the amino acid sequence that is initially translated using the symbols shown in appendix C to this subpart, with the modified positions (_e.g.,_ hydroxylations or glycosylations) being described as set forth in appendix D to this subpart, but these modifications shall not be shown explicitly in the amino acid sequence. Any peptide or protein that can be expressed as a sequence using the symbols in appendix C to this subpart, in conjunction with a description in the Feature section, to describe, for example, modified linkages, cross links and end caps, non-peptidyl bonds, etc., is embraced by this definition.
- **Note 1 to paragraph (a):** Appendices A through F to this subpart contain Tables 1– 6 of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Handbook on Industrial Property Information and Documentation, Standard ST.25: Standard for the Presentation of Nucleotide and Amino Acid Sequence Listings in Patent Applications (2009).
- (b) Patent applications which contain disclosures of nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences, in accordance with the definition in paragraph (a) of this section, shall, with regard to the manner in which the nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences are presented and described, conform exclusively to the requirements of §§ **[1.821](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html)**  through **[1.825](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e334511.html)**.
- (c) Patent applications that contain disclosures of nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences, as defined in paragraph (a) of this section, must contain a "Sequence Listing," which is a separate part of the specification containing each of those nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences and associated information using the symbols and format in accordance with the requirements of §§ **[1.822](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333753.html)**  and **[1.823](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333837.html)**. The "Sequence Listing" must be submitted as follows, except for a national stage entry under § **[1.495(b)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//aia_d0e329467.html##aia_d0e329486)**, where the "Sequence Listing" has been previously communicated by the International Bureau or originally filed in the United States Patent and Trademark Office and complies with Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) **[Rule 5.2](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e366450.html##d0e366501)**:

## II.    **INTERNATIONAL AND FOREIGN APPLICATIONS**

The requirements of **[37 CFR 1.821](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html)**  through **[37 CFR 1.825](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e334511.html)**  are the result of an effort to harmonize the USPTO requirements with international sequence listing requirements to the extent possible. The requirements of **[37 CFR 1.821](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html)**  through **[37 CFR 1.825](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e334511.html)**  substantially correspond to the requirements of WIPO Standard ST.25 (2009). However, the requirements of **[37 CFR 1.821](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html)**  through **[37 CFR 1.825](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e334511.html)**  are less stringent than the requirements of WIPO Standard ST.25 (2009). Thus, applicants who have filed or wish to file international applications or applications in countries that adhere to WIPO Standard ST.25 (2009) should be aware of the following requirements:

- (A) The data in numeric identifier <221> must use selections from Tables 5 and 6 of WIPO Standard ST.25 (2009) to comply with that standard. The terms from these Tables are considered language neutral vocabulary;
- (B) WIPO Standard ST.25 (2009), paragraph 24, requires a blank line between numeric identifiers in the sequence listing when the digit in the first or second position of the numeric identifier changes;
- (C) Where the sequence listing forming part of the description of the international application contains free text, e.g., free text in numeric identifier <223>, any such free text shall be repeated in the main part of the description in the language thereof (**[PCT Rule 5.2(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e366450.html##d0e366513)** ). It is recommended that the free text in the language of the main part of the description be put in a specific section of the description called "Sequence Listing Free Text";
- (D) A sequence listing filed after the international filing date is generally not considered to be part of the disclosure and usually will not be published as part of the international application publication (see **[PCT Article 34](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e364117.html)**  and **[PCT Rules 26](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e369418.html)**  and **[91](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e377673.html)**  for exceptions); and
- (E) Paragraph 4(v) of WIPO Standard ST.25 (2009) requires an accompanying statement with the specific wording "the information recorded in electronic form furnished under **[PCT Rule 13ter](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e367886.html)**  is identical to the sequence listing **as contained in the international application**".

With further regard to requirements (A) and (B), is noted that PatentIn Version 3.5.1 software (see **[MPEP § 2430](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e247753.html)**) generates sequence listings that meet all of the requirements of WIPO Standard ST.25 (2009). Applicants should similarly be aware that filing requirements for sequence listings may differ between a national US application, a foreign application and an international application during international phase. For example, where an international application is filed in paper, the sequence listing part of the international application must similarly be provided in paper. In addition, a copy of the sequence listing in ASCII plain text, to be used for the purpose of the international search (**[PCT Rule 13ter](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e367886.html)** ) must be filed on read-only optical disc or via the USPTO electronic filing system. Furthermore, in contrast to US national applications, a sequence listing filed with RO/US in ASCII plain text that is 300 MB or more in size is not subject to a size fee during the international phase of an international application.

# 2422.01    Nucleotide and/or Amino Acids Disclosures Requiring a "Sequence Listing" [R-07.2022]

_[Editor Note: This section is not applicable to applications filed on or after July 1, 2022, having disclosures of nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences as defined in **[37 CFR 1.831(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1bdc8_2b8.html##ar_it_35d57_211e4_8c)**. See **[MPEP §§ 2412](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d22348_25ede_3e6.html)**-**[2419](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d35dcb_1e61f_10b.html)** for guidance on WIPO ST.26 requirements for applications filed on or after July 1, 2022.]_

## I.    **LENGTH THRESHOLDS**

**[37 CFR 1.821(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html)**  presents a definition for "nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences." This definition sets forth limits, in terms of numbers of amino acids and/or numbers of nucleotides, at or above which compliance with the sequence rules is required. Nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences as used in **[37 CFR 1.821](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html)**  through **[37 CFR 1.825](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e334511.html)**  are interpreted to mean an unbranched sequence of four or more amino acids or an unbranched sequence of ten or more nucleotides. Branched sequences are specifically excluded from this definition. Sequences with fewer than ten specifically defined nucleotides or four specifically defined amino acids are specifically excluded from **[37 CFR 1.821](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html)**. "Specifically defined" means those amino acids other than "Xaa" and those nucleotide bases other than "n" defined in Appendices A-F to 37 CFR part 1, Subpart G (see **[MPEP § 2422(I)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e242638.html)**).

The limit of four or more amino acids was established for consistency with limits in place for industry database collections whereas the limit of ten or more nucleotides, while lower than certain industry database limits, was established to encompass those nucleotide sequences to which the smallest probe will bind in a stable manner.

## II.    **REPRESENTATION OF NUCLEIC ACIDS AND AMINO ACIDS**

**[37 CFR 1.821(a)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html)**  and **[37 CFR 1.821(a)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html)**  present further definitions for those nucleotide and amino acid sequences that are intended to be embraced by the sequence rules. Situations in which the applicability of the rules is in issue will be resolved on a case-by-case basis.

Nucleotide sequences are further limited to those that can be represented by the symbols set forth in **[37 CFR 1.822(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333753.html)**  and Appendices A and B to 37 CFR part 1, Subpart G (see **[MPEP § 2422(I)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e242638.html)**). The presence of other than typical 5' to 3' phosphodiester linkages in a nucleotide sequence does not render the rules inapplicable. For example, the Office does not want to exclude linkages of the type commonly found in naturally occurring nucleotides, e.g., eukaryotic end capped sequences.

Amino acid sequences are further limited to those in **[37 CFR 1.822(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333753.html)**  and Appendices C and D to 37 CFR part 1, Subpart G (see **[MPEP § 2422(I)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e242638.html)**) and those L-amino acids that are commonly found in naturally occurring proteins. The presence of one or more D-amino acids in a sequence will exclude that sequence from the scope of the rules. Voluntary compliance is, however, encouraged in these situations; the symbol "Xaa" can be used to represent D-amino acids. The sequence rules embrace "[a]ny peptide or protein that can be expressed as a sequence using the symbols in Appendix C to 37 CFR part 1, Subpart G (see **[MPEP § 2422(I)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e242638.html)**) in conjunction with a description in the Feature section to describe, for example, modified linkages, cross links and end caps, non-peptidyl bonds, etc." **[37 CFR 1.821(a)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html)**.

With regard to amino acid sequences, the use of the terms "peptide or protein" implies that the amino acids in a given sequence are linked by at least three consecutive peptide bonds. Accordingly, an amino acid sequence is not excluded from the scope of the rules merely due to the presence of a single non-peptidyl bond. If an amino acid sequence can be represented by a string of amino acid abbreviations, modifications in the sequence, if any, set forth in the Features section, the sequence comes within the scope of the rules. However, the rules are not intended to encompass the subject matter that is generally referred to as synthetic resins.

## III.    **SEQUENCES DISCLOSED IN APPLICATION TEXT**

The requirement for compliance in **[37 CFR 1.821(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html##d0e333702)**  is directed to "disclosures of nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences." (Emphasis added.) All sequences, whether claimed or not, that meet the length thresholds in **[37 CFR 1.821(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html##d0e333661)**  are subject to the "Sequence Listing" rules. The goal of the Office is to build a comprehensive database that can be used for, _inter alia,_ assessing the prior art. It is therefore essential that all sequences, whether only disclosed or also claimed, be included in the database. In those instances in which prior art sequences are only referred to in a given application by name and a publication or accession reference, they need not be included as part of the "Sequence Listing", unless the referred-to sequence is "essential material" per **[MPEP § 608.01(p)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e46258.html)**. However, if the applicant presents the sequence as a string of particular nucleotide bases or amino acids, whether by way of symbols, words or chemical structure, it is necessary to include the sequence in the "Sequence Listing" regardless of whether the applicant considers the sequence to be prior art, so long as the sequence meets the criteria of **[37 CFR 1.821(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html##d0e333661)**. In general, any sequence that is disclosed and/or claimed as a sequence, i.e., as a string of particular nucleotide bases or amino acids, and that otherwise meets the criteria of **[37 CFR 1.821(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html##d0e333661)**, must be set forth in the "Sequence Listing".

## IV.    **VARIANTS OF A PRESENTED SEQUENCE**

It is generally acceptable to present a single, primary sequence in the specification and "Sequence Listing" by enumeration of its residues in accordance with the sequence rules ("primary sequence") and to discuss and/or claim variants of that primary sequence without presenting each variant as a separate sequence in the "Sequence Listing". Where the variant sequence meets the length thresholds of **[37 CFR 1.821(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html##d0e333661)**  and is disclosed by enumeration of its residues anywhere in an application, it must be presented in a "Sequence Listing" in a manner that complies with the requirements of the sequence rules. However, the primary sequence should be annotated in the "Sequence Listing" to reflect such variants. By way of example only, the following types of sequence disclosures would be treated as noted herein by the Office. With respect to a primary sequence and "conservatively modified variants thereof," the sequences may be described as SEQ ID NO:X (the primary sequence) and "conservatively modified variants thereof," if desired. With respect to a sequence that "may be deleted at the C-terminus by 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 residues," all of the implied variations do not need to be included in the "Sequence Listing". In this latter example, only the sequence without deletions needs to be included in the "Sequence Listing", though applicant is encouraged to annotate the sequence to indicate that deletions have been made at the C-terminus by 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 residues.

The Office's database will only contain the unmodified sequence. It is strongly recommended that any sequences appearing in the claims, or sequences that are considered essential to understanding the invention, be included in the "Sequence Listing" as a separate sequence.

## V.    **SEQUENCE IDENTIFIER**

**[37 CFR 1.821(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html##d0e333702)**  and **[37 CFR 1.823(a)(5)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333837.html##ar_it_337f1_2121b_346)**  require that each disclosed nucleic acid and/or amino acid sequence in the application appear separately in the "Sequence Listing", with each sequence further being assigned a sequence identifier, referred to as "SEQ ID NO." or the like. The use of "SEQ ID NO:" is preferred, but including "or the like" is intended to ensure that a formalities notice is not sent when an application uses, for example, "SEQ NO." or "Seq. Id. No." or any similar identification for an amino acid or nucleotide sequence in the specification or claims where it is clear that a sequence from the "Sequence Listing" is shown in the description or claims. The sequence identifiers must begin with 1 and increase sequentially by integers. The requirement for sequence identifiers, at a minimum, requires that each sequence be assigned a different number for purposes of identification. However, where practical and for ease of reference, sequences should be presented in the "Sequence Listing" in numerical order and in the order in which they are discussed in the application.

**[37 CFR 1.821(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html##d0e333718)**  further requires that where the description or claims of a patent application discuss a sequence that is set forth in the "Sequence Listing", a reference to the sequence identifier of that sequence is required at all occurrences, even if in the text of the description or claims where the sequence is set forth by enumeration of its residues. This requirement is also intended to permit references elsewhere in the application (e.g., specification, claims, or drawings) to sequences set forth in the "Sequence Listing" by the use of assigned sequence identifiers without repeating the sequence. Sequence identifiers can also be used to discuss and/or claim parts or fragments of a properly presented sequence. For example, language such as "residues 14 to 243 of SEQ ID NO:23" is permissible and the fragment need not be separately presented in the "Sequence Listing". Where a sequence that meets the length thresholds of **[37 CFR 1.821(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html##d0e333661)**  is disclosed by enumeration of its residues anywhere in an application, it must be presented in a "Sequence Listing" in a manner that complies with the requirements of the sequence rules.

The rules do not alter, in any way, the requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302824912.html)**. The implementation of the rules has had no effect on disclosure and/or claiming requirements. The rules, in general, or the use of sequence identifiers throughout the specification and claims, specifically, should not raise any issues under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**  or **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)**. The use of sequence identifiers (SEQ ID NO:X or the like) only provides a shorthand way for applicants to discuss and claim their inventions. These identifiers do not in any way restrict the manner in which an invention can be claimed.

_[Editor Note: This section is not applicable to applications filed on or after July 1, 2022, having disclosures of nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences as defined in **[37 CFR 1.831(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1bdc8_2b8.html##ar_it_35d57_211e4_8c)**.

For all applications that disclose nucleic acid and/or amino acid sequences that fall within the definition set forth in **[37 CFR 1.821(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html##d0e333661)**, **[37 CFR 1.821(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html##d0e333692)** requires exclusive conformance to the requirements of **[37 CFR 1.821](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html)**  through **[37 CFR 1.825](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e334511.html)**  with regard to the manner in which the disclosed nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences are presented and described. This requirement is necessary to minimize any confusion that could result if more than one format for representing sequence data was employed in a given application.

Pursuant to **[37 CFR 1.83(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e320967.html##d0e320975)**, sequences that are included in sequence listings should not be duplicated in the drawings. However many significant sequence characteristics may only be demonstrated by a figure. This is especially true in view of the fact that the representation of double stranded nucleotides is not permitted in the "Sequence Listing" and many significant nucleotide features, such as "sticky ends" and the like, may only be shown effectively by reference to a drawing figure. Further, the similarity or homology between/among sequences may only be depicted in an effective manner in a drawing figure. Similarly, drawing figures are recommended for use with amino acid sequences to depict structural features of the corresponding protein, such as epitopes and interaction domains. The situations discussed herein are given by way of example only and there may be many other reasons for including a sequence in a drawing. However, when a sequence is presented in a drawing, the sequence must still be included in the "Sequence Listing" if the sequence falls within the definition set forth in **[37 CFR 1.821(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html##d0e333661)**, and a sequence identifier ("SEQ ID NO:X" or the like) must be used, either in the drawing itself or in the Brief Description of the Drawings.

The read-only optical disc used to submit the "Sequence Listing" may also contain "Large Tables" if the table has more than 50 pages of text. See **[1.52(e)(1)(iii)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e318327.html)**  and **[37 CFR 1.58(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e319627.html##d0e319657)**, **[(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e319627.html##ar_it_337ef_222f0_269)**  and **[(i)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e319627.html##ar_it_337ef_22611_235)**. The read-only optical disc and duplicate copy must be labeled "Copy 1" and "Copy 2," respectively, and a statement stating that the copies are identical must be included. If the two read-only optical discs are not identical, the Office will use the disc labeled "Copy 1" for further processing (**[37 CFR 1.58(i)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e319627.html##ar_it_337ef_22611_235)**  ).

Similarly, if the "Sequence Listing" is filed in a national stage application submitted under **[35 U.S.C. 371](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e307164.html)**  as an ASCII plain text file in compliance with **[37 CFR 1.824](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e334418.html)**  on read-only optical disc(s) in accordance with **[37 CFR 1.52(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e318327.html##d0e318519)**  and applicant has not filed a "Sequence Listing" as a PDF image file or on physical sheets of paper, the ASCII plain text file will serve as both the "Sequence Listing" under **[37 CFR 1.821(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html##d0e333702)**  and the CRF of the "Sequence Listing" under **[37 CFR 1.821(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html)**.

## A.   **_ASCII Plain Text Files Up to 300 MB_**

When the "Sequence Listing" or CRF is submitted via read-only optical disc(s), the text file may either be compressed or not compressed. If the ASCII plain text file is not compressed, the ASCII plain text file must be contained on a single read-only optical disc. However, if the file does not fit on a single read-only optical disc even after compression, a compressed ASCII plain text file may be split into multiple file parts, in accordance with the target read-only optical disc size, and labeled in compliance with **[37 CFR 1.52(e)(5)(vi)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e318327.html##ar_it_337ef_1eb25_266)**. See **[37 CFR 1.824(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e334418.html##d0e334460)**.

## B.   **_ASCII Plain Text Files 300 MB or Over_**

Any "Sequence Listing" ASCII plain text file of 300 MB or more is subject to a fee under **[37 CFR 1.21(o)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e316474.html##d0e316751)**  to manage handling of the oversized submission (**[37 CFR 1.52(f)(3)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e318327.html##ar_it_3383b_1e5fa_7d)** ). Pricing for this fee is divided into two tiers with Tier 1 for file sizes 300 MB to 800 MB and Tier 2 for file sizes greater than 800 MB. The level of effort associated with the handling of mega-"Sequence Listing" is significant, because the Office’s systems require extra storage and special handling for files beyond 300 MB. The fee should encourage applicants to draft their specifications such that sequence data that is not essential material is not required to be included in a "Sequence Listing". A reduced number of mega-"Sequence Listings" will benefit the Office and the public by reducing the strain on Office resources, thus facilitating the effective administration of the patent system.

The fee under **[37 CFR 1.21(o)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e316474.html##d0e316751)**  is due upon the first submission of a "Sequence Listing" that exceeds 800 MB, or the first submission of a "Sequence Listing" of at least 300MB, whichever applicable fee is higher. As an example, if an application was filed prior to January 16, 2018 (with or without a text file "Sequence Listing"), and thereafter a mega-"Sequence Listing" that is between 300 and 800 MB is filed, the fee under **[37 CFR 1.21(o)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e316474.html##ar_it_2bf24_24e3f_1e5)**  is due. If an applicant thereafter files a corrected "Sequence Listing" that is also between 300 and 800 MB, no additional fee is due. If a further corrected "Sequence Listing" is filed and the file size exceeds 800 MB, then the total fee owed under **[37 CFR 1.21(o)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e316474.html##d0e316751)**  is the fee set forth in **[37 CFR 1.21(o)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e316474.html##ar_it_2bf24_24ea2_277)**. The fee, which is difference between the current fee and the prior paid fee, is due upon submission of the mega-"Sequence Listing". Subsequent deletion or reduction in size of a "Sequence Listing" does not change the requirement to pay the mega-"Sequence Listing" submission fee.

The fee under **[37 CFR 1.21(o)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e316474.html##d0e316751)**  does not apply to international applications in the international stage, but does apply to the submission of mega-"Sequence Listings" received in national stage applications under **[35 U.S.C. 371](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e307164.html)**, including mega-"Sequence Listings" received by the Office pursuant to **[PCT Article 20](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e363585.html)**.

## I.    **ASCII PLAIN TEXT FILES SERVE AS BOTH THE "SEQUENCE LISTING" AND THE CRF**

It is recommended that a "Sequence Listing" be submitted as an ASCII plain text file via the USPTO patent electronic filing system rather than as a PDF image file. See subsection IV, below, for information regarding filing an international application (PCT) with a sequence listing ASCII plain text file via the USPTO patent electronic filing system.

If the "Sequence Listing" is submitted in an application filed under **[35 U.S.C. 111(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//pltd0e302673aia.html##pltd0e302678aia)**  as an ASCII plain text file in compliance with **[37 CFR 1.824](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e334418.html)**  via the USPTO patent electronic filing system and applicant has not filed a "Sequence Listing" as a PDF image file or on physical sheets of paper, the ASCII plain text file will serve as both the "Sequence Listing" under **[37 CFR 1.821(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html##d0e333702)**  and the CRF of the "Sequence Listing" under **[37 CFR 1.821(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html)**.

Thus, the following are not required and should not be submitted: (1) a second copy of the "Sequence Listing" as a PDF image file or on physical sheets of paper; and (2) a statement under **[37 CFR 1.821(e)(1)(ii)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html##ar_it_337f1_20354_31)**  or **[(2)(ii)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html##ar_it_337f1_20740_5e)**  (indicating that the sequence information contained in the "Sequence Listing" under **[37 CFR 1.821(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html##d0e333702)**  and CRF copy of the "Sequence Listing" under **[37 CFR 1.821(e)(1)(ii)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html##ar_it_337f1_20354_31)**  or **[(2)(ii)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html##ar_it_337f1_20740_5e)**  are identical). Also, the practice of CRF transfers has been eliminated. Checker software that may be used to check a "Sequence Listing" for compliance with the requirements of **[37 CFR 1.824](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e334418.html)**  is available on the USPTO website at **[www.uspto.gov/Checker4](https://www.uspto.gov/patents/basics/types-patent-applications/utility-patent/checker-version-446)**. The User Notes on the Checker website should be consulted for an explanation of the scope of errors and content that is able to be verified by the Checker software.

A "Sequence Listing" submitted as a PDF image file via the USPTO patent electronic filing system or on read-only optical disc will not be excluded when determining the application size fee.

See subsection IV, below, for additional information regarding application size fees in an international application (PCT).

## III.    **SIZE RESTRICTIONS FOR ASCII PLAIN TEXT FILES**

One hundred (100) megabytes is the size limit for "Sequence Listing" ASCII plain text files submitted via the USPTO patent electronic filing system, and compression is not allowed for a "Sequence Listing" submitted via the USPTO patent electronic filing system. If a user wishes to submit a "Sequence Listing" ASCII plain text file that exceeds 100 megabytes, it is recommended that the user file the application without the "Sequence Listing" using the USPTO patent electronic filing system to obtain the application number and confirmation number, and then file the "Sequence Listing" on read-only optical disc(s) in accordance with **[37 CFR 1.52(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e318327.html##d0e318519)**  and **[1.824](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e334418.html)**  on the same day by using Priority Mail Express® from the USPS in accordance with **[37 CFR 1.10](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e313951.html)**, or hand delivery, in order to secure the same filing date for all parts of the application. Note: a submission of a "Sequence Listing" in electronic form of 300 MB or more in size is subject to an oversized submission fee set forth in **[37 CFR 1.21(o)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e316474.html##d0e316751)**. See **[37 CFR 1.52(f)(3)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e318327.html##ar_it_3383b_1e5fa_7d)**. Alternatively, a user may submit the application on physical sheets of paper and include the "Sequence Listing" ASCII plain text file on read-only optical disc(s) in accordance with **[37 CFR 1.52(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e318327.html##d0e318519)**. "Sequence Listing" ASCII plain text files may not be divided into multiple files so as to not exceed the 100 MB size limit for filing via the USPTO patent electronic filing system, and any "Sequence Listing" greater than 100 MB must be submitted on read-only optical disc(s). If the "Sequence Listing" is filed on a read-only optical disc, the "Sequence Listing" must be a single file, and any not compressed file must be contained on a single read-only optical disc. However, a compressed file that does not fit on a single read-only optical disc may be split into multiple file parts, in accordance with the target read-only optical disc size, and must have a label permanently affixed thereto on which the following information has been hand-printed or typed: (i) First-named inventor (if known); (ii) Title of the invention; (iii) Attorney docket or file reference number (if applicable); (iv) Application number and filing date (if known); (v) Date on which the data were recorded on the read-only optical disc; and (vi) Disc order (e.g., "1 of X"), if multiple read-only optical discs are submitted. See **[37 CFR 1.52(e)(5)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e318327.html##d0e318582)**  and **[1.824(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e334418.html##d0e334460)**.

See subsection IV.B, below, for information regarding submission of a sequence listing text file that exceeds 100 megabytes in an international application (PCT) filed via the USPTO patent electronic filing system.

The current size limit on the USPTO patent electronic filing system for ASCII plain text file submissions of "Large Tables" and a "Computer Program Listing Appendix" is 25 megabytes per submission, and compression is not allowed for "Large Tables" and a "Computer Program Listing Appendix" submitted as ASCII plain text files via the USPTO patent electronic filing system. Files above the 25 MB limit for "Large Tables" and a "Computer Program Listing Appendix" may be either (1) broken up into multiple files that are no larger than 25 MB each and those smaller files may be submitted via the USPTO patent electronic filing system or (2) submitted on read-only optical disc(s) (see **[37 CFR 1.52(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e318327.html##d0e318519)** ). If the user chooses to break up a "Large Table" or "Computer Program Listing Appendix" file so that it may be submitted via the USPTO patent electronic filing system, the file names must indicate their order (e.g., "1 of X", "2 of X"). If a user wishes to file an application with a "Large Table" or "Computer Program Listing Appendix" ASCII plain text file that is larger than 25 megabytes, it is recommended that the user file the application without the "Large Table" or "Computer Program Listing Appendix" using the USPTO patent electronic filing system to obtain the application number and confirmation number, and then file the "Large Table" or "Computer Program Listing Appendix" on read-only optical disc(s) in accordance with **[37 CFR 1.52(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e318327.html##d0e318519)**  and **[1.58(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e319627.html##d0e319657)**  or **[1.96(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e321513.html##d0e321559)**  on the same day by using Priority Mail Express® from the USPS in accordance with **[37 CFR 1.10](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e313951.html)**, or hand delivery, in order to secure the same filing date for all parts of the application. Alternatively, a user may submit the application on physical sheets of paper and include the "Large Table" or "Computer Program Listing Appendix" ASCII plain text file on read-only optical disc(s) in accordance with **[37 CFR 1.52(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e318327.html##d0e318519)**  in order to secure the same filing date for all parts of the application. See **[37 CFR 1.58(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e319627.html##ar_it_337ef_222f0_269)**  and **[37 CFR 1.96(c)(4)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e321513.html##ar_it_337f0_1d4d4_73)**.

## IV.    **FILING A SEQUENCE LISTING IN INTERNATIONAL APPLICATIONS (PCT) VIA THE USPTO PATENT ELECTRONIC FILING SYSTEM**

## A.    **_Sequence Listing Must Be Presented as a Separate Part of the Description_**

Under **[PCT Rule 5.2(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e366450.html##d0e366509)**, "where the international application contains disclosure of one or more nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences, the description shall contain a sequence listing complying with the standard provided for in the Administrative Instructions and presented as a separate part of the description in accordance with that standard". The standard is set forth in the PCT Administrative Instructions Annex C, entitled Standard for the Presentation of Nucleotide and Amino Acid Sequence Listings in International Patent Applications Under the PCT. When filing an international application (PCT) using the USPTO patent electronic filing system, it is highly recommended to submit a sequence listing as a single ASCII plain text file with a ".txt" extension on the international filing date. Note that 100 megabytes is the size limit for submitting a sequence listing ASCII plain text file via the USPTO patent electronic filing system. See subsection IV.B, below. Although it is not recommended, applicant can also submit the sequence listing in a PCT application as a PDF image file as part of the application on the international filing date.

If the sequence listing is submitted as an ASCII plain text file when filing a new international application (PCT), applicant need not and should not submit any additional copies, including PDF image files. The single ASCII plain text file is preferred because the ASCII plain text file will serve both as the sequence listing part of the description required under **[PCT Rule 5.2](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e366450.html##d0e366501)**  and the electronic form under **[PCT Rule 13ter.1(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e367886.html##d0e367906)**  in the absence of a PDF sequence listing file. The check list (Box No. IX) of the PCT Request (form PCT/RO/101) provided via the USPTO patent electronic filing system together with the international application (PCT) must indicate that the sequence listing submitted as an ASCII plain text file forms part of the international application. Furthermore, the statement as set forth in paragraph 4(v) of the **[AI Annex C](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e285466.html)**  (Administrative Instructions under the PCT, Annex C), that "the information recorded in electronic form furnished under **[PCT Rule 13ter](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e367886.html)**   is identical to the sequence listing as contained in the international application," is not necessary.

Submission of the sequence listing part of the description as a PDF image file in a new international application (PCT) is not recommended because, where the application does not contain a sequence listing as an ASCII plain text file, the International Searching Authority or the International Preliminary Authority may invite applicant to furnish a copy of the sequence listing in ASCII plain text format for the purposes of international search and/or preliminary examination. Any sequence listing submitted in response to this invitation will not form part of the application.

When a sequence listing is filed via the USPTO patent electronic filing system in a new PCT international application as both a PDF image file and an ASCII plain text file, but the Request form Box No. IX does not indicate which one forms part of the international application, the PDF image copy of the sequence listing will be considered to form part of the application and the ASCII plain text file will be considered to be an accompanying item for search purposes under **[PCT Rule 13ter.1(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e367886.html##d0e367906)**  only.

The international filing fee for an international application (PCT) that includes a sequence listing, filed via the USPTO patent electronic filing system, is calculated based on the type of sequence listing file that is part of the description of the international application (PCT). A sequence listing filed as an ASCII plain text file will not be included in the sheet count of the international application (PCT). A sequence listing filed as a PDF image file will be included in the sheet count of the international application (PCT), when it is part of the description. When a new PCT international application is filed via the USPTO patent electronic filing system and contains the sequence listing part of the description as a PDF image file and a sequence listing ASCII plain text to be used only for search purposes under **[PCT Rule 13ter.1(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e367886.html##d0e367906)**, the sheets of the PDF image file will count towards excess sheet fees, if any.

## B.    **_File Size and Quantity Limits_**

One hundred (100) megabytes is the size limit for sequence listing ASCII plain text files submitted via the USPTO patent electronic filing system. See **[37 CFR 1.824(b)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e334418.html##d0e334464)**. Sequence listing ASCII plain text files must not be partitioned into multiple files for filing via the USPTO patent electronic filing system. The sequence listing must be in a single ASCII plain text file.

Applicant may use the USPTO patent electronic filing system to file part of the international application (PCT) and to obtain the international application (PCT) number and the confirmation number, and then file the remainder of the international application (PCT) on the same day as one or more follow-on submissions using the USPTO patent electronic filing system, in order to secure the same filing date for all parts of the international application (PCT). However, applicant is not permitted to file part of the international application (PCT) electronically via the USPTO patent electronic filing system, and then file the remainder of the international application (PCT) on paper to secure a filing date of all parts of the international application (PCT).

In the situation where applicant needs to file a sequence listing that is over one hundred (100) megabytes, applicant may use the USPTO patent electronic filing system to file the international application (PCT) without the sequence listing to obtain the international application (PCT) number and the confirmation number, and then file the sequence listing on read-only optical discs on the same day by using Priority Mail Express® from the USPS in accordance with **[37 CFR 1.10](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e313951.html)**, or by hand delivery, in order to secure the same filing date for all parts of the international application (PCT). However, the read-only optical discs must not contain PDF image files and must fully comply with the guidelines for filing a sequence listing on electronic media. The check list of the PCT Request provided via the USPTO patent electronic filing system together with the international application (PCT) must indicate that the sequence listing will be filed separately on physical data carrier(s), on the same day and in the form of an Annex C/ST.25 text file. The sequence listing must be a single file, but the file may be split for submission on multiple physical media using software designed to divide a file into multiple files for subsequent concatenation. If the user breaks up a sequence listing for submission on multiple read-only optical discs, the read-only optical discs must be labeled to indicate their order (e.g., "1 of X", "2 of X").

Submissions of very lengthy sequence listings (300 MB or over a.k.a. mega-sequence listings) in international applications are not subject to the mega-sequence listing submission fees set forth in **[37 CFR 1.21(o)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e316474.html##d0e316751)**. However, for mega-sequence listing submissions on or after January 16, 2018, the fee under **[37 CFR 1.21(o)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e316474.html##d0e316751)**  does apply to the submission of mega-sequence listings received in national stage applications under **[35 U.S.C. 371](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e307164.html)**, including mega-sequence listings received by the Office pursuant to **[PCT Article 20](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e363585.html)**. Similarly, if an international application is filed at RO/US with a mega-sequence listing, and thereafter a bypass continuing application is filed under **[35 U.S.C. 111(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//pltd0e302673aia.html##pltd0e302678aia)**, the fee under **[37 CFR 1.21(o)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e316474.html##d0e316751)**  will be due in the continuing application for mega-sequence listing submissions on or after January 16, 2018. See **[37 CFR 1.52(f)(3)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e318327.html##ar_it_3383b_1e5fa_7d)**.

However, the Office prefers submission of sequence information as an ASCII plain text file via the USPTO patent electronic filing system or on read-only optical disc(s) without a copy of the "Sequence Listing" as a PDF image file or on physical sheets of paper in all applications because such an ASCII submission will serve as both the "Sequence Listing" required by **[37 CFR 1.821(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html##d0e333702)**  and the CRF of the "Sequence Listing" required by **[37 CFR 1.821(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html)**  and the "Sequence Listing" submitted as an ASCII plain text file will not be included in the application size fee determination under **[37 CFR 1.52(f)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e318327.html##d0e318625)**  or **[(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e318327.html##d0e318662)**. See **[MPEP § 2422.03(a)(I)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d24b1e_175aa_27c.html)**.

The information on the computer readable form will be entered into the Office’s database for searching and printing nucleotide and amino acid sequences. This electronic database will also enable the Office to provide published sequence data, in electronic form, to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) for publication in GenBank, and enable NCBI to exchange data with the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) and the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI). It should be noted that the Office’s database complies with the confidentiality requirement imposed by **[35 U.S.C. 122](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e303054.html)**. Unpublished pending application sequences are maintained in the database separately from published or patented sequences. That is, the Office will not exchange or make public any information on any sequence until the patent application containing that information is published or matures into a patent, or as otherwise allowed by **[35 U.S.C. 122](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e303054.html)**.

The Office may permit correction of the "Sequence Listing" submitted pursuant to **[37 CFR 1.821(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html)**, whether on physical sheets of paper or as a PDF image file, at the least, during the pendency of a given application by reference to the computer readable form thereof submitted pursuant to**[37 CFR 1.821(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html)**  if both the "Sequence Listing" and computer readable form were submitted at the time of filing of the application and the totality of the circumstances otherwise substantiate the proposed correction. A mere discrepancy between the "Sequence Listing" and the computer readable form may not, in and of itself, be sufficient to justify a proposed correction. In this regard, the Office will assume that the computer readable form has been incorporated by reference into the application when the "Sequence Listing" and computer readable form were submitted at the time of filing of the application. The Office will attempt to accommodate or address all correction issues, but it must be kept in mind that the real burden rests with the applicant to ensure that any discrepancies between the "Sequence Listing" and the CRF copy are eliminated or minimized. Applicants should be aware that there will be instances where the applicant may have to suffer the consequences of any discrepancies between the two. It is noted that in an application filed under **[35 U.S.C. 111(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//pltd0e302673aia.html##pltd0e302678aia)**  in which applicant has not filed a second copy of the "Sequence Listing" as a PDF image file or on physical sheets of paper (see **[37 CFR 1.821(e)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html##ar_it_337f1_202fe_ed)** ), an ASCII plain text file will serve as both the "Sequence Listing" required by **[37 CFR 1.821(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html##d0e333702)**  and the CRF required by **[37 CFR 1.821(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html##d0e333722)**, eliminating any chance for discrepancies. Filing the "Sequence Listing" as an ASCII plain text file submitted via the USPTO patent electronic filing system that complies with both **[37 CFR 1.821(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html##d0e333702)**  and **[(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html##d0e333722)**  is the Office’s preferred method of receiving a "Sequence Listing".

The Office does not desire to be bound by a requirement to permanently preserve computer readable forms submitted on read-only optical disc(s) for support, priority or correction purposes. Thus, once use of the CRF by the Office for processing has ended, i.e., once the Office has entered the data contained on the computer readable form into the appropriate database, the Office does not intend to further preserve the CRF submitted by the applicant, and applicant should not expect to have the read-only optical disc(s) returned. See **[37 CFR 1.52(e)(6)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e318327.html##d0e318589)**.

When a substitute specification is required because the number or nature of amendments would make it difficult to examine the application, the applicant must include a statement that the substitute specification includes no new matter. The necessity of requiring sequence information as an ASCII plain text file is similar to the necessity of requiring a substitute specification and, likewise, the burden is on the applicant to ensure that no new matter is added. Applicants have a duty to comply with the statutory prohibition (**[35 U.S.C. 132](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e303187.html)**  and **[35 U.S.C. 251](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e305345.html)** ) against the introduction of new matter.

The correction of errors in sequencing or any other errors that are made in describing an invention are subject to the statutory prohibition (**[35 U.S.C. 132](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e303187.html)**  and **[35 U.S.C. 251](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e305345.html)** ) against the introduction of new matter.

#### _37 C.F.R. 1.822   Symbols and format to be used for nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence data._

- (a) The symbols and format to be used for nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence data shall conform to the requirements of paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section.
- (b) The code for representing the nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence characters shall conform to the code set forth in appendices A and C to this subpart. No code other than that specified in these sections shall be used in nucleotide and amino acid sequences. A modified base or modified or unusual amino acid may be presented in a given sequence as the corresponding unmodified base or amino acid if the modified base or modified or unusual amino acid is one of those listed in appendices B and D to this subpart, and the modification is also set forth in the Feature section. Otherwise, each occurrence of a base or amino acid not appearing in appendices A and C, shall be listed in a given sequence as "n" or "Xaa," respectively, with further information, as appropriate, given in the Feature section, by including one or more feature keys listed in appendices E and F to this subpart.
- **Note 1 to paragraph (b):** Appendices A through F to this subpart contain Tables 1– 6 of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Handbook on Industrial Property Information and Documentation, Standard ST.25: Standard for the Presentation of Nucleotide and Amino Acid Sequence Listings in Patent Applications (2009).
- (c) _Format representation of nucleotides._
    - (1) A nucleotide sequence shall be listed using the lowercase letter for representing the one-letter code for the nucleotide bases set forth in appendix A to this subpart.
    - (2) The bases in a nucleotide sequence (including introns) shall be listed in groups of 10 bases except in the coding parts of the sequence. Leftover bases, fewer than 10 in number, at the end of noncoding parts of a sequence shall be grouped together and separated from adjacent groups of 10 or 3 bases by a space.
    - (3) The bases in the coding parts of a nucleotide sequence shall be listed as triplets (codons). The amino acids corresponding to the codons in the coding parts of a nucleotide sequence shall be listed immediately below the corresponding codons. Where a codon spans an intron, the amino acid symbol shall be listed below the portion of the codon containing two nucleotides.
    - (4) A nucleotide sequence shall be listed with a maximum of 16 codons or 60 bases per line, with a space provided between each codon or group of 10 bases.
    - (5) A nucleotide sequence shall be represented, only by a single strand, in the 5 to 3 direction, from left to right.
    - (6) The enumeration of nucleotide bases shall start at the first base of the sequence with number 1. The enumeration shall be continuous through the whole sequence in the direction 5 to 3. The enumeration shall appear in the right margin, next to the line containing the one-letter codes for the bases and giving the number of the last base of that line.
    - (7) For those nucleotide sequences that are circular in configuration, the enumeration method set forth in paragraph (c)(6) of this section remains applicable with the exception that the designation of the first base of the nucleotide sequence may be made at the option of the applicant.
- **Note 2 to paragraph (c):** Appendices A through F to this subpart contain Tables 1– 6 of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Handbook on Industrial Property Information and Documentation, Standard ST.25: Standard for the Presentation of Nucleotide and Amino Acid Sequence Listings in Patent Applications (2009).
- (d) _Representation of amino acids._
    - (1) The amino acids in a protein or peptide sequence shall be listed using the three-letter abbreviation, with the first letter as an upper case character, as in Appendix C to this subpart.
    - (2) A protein or peptide sequence shall be listed with a maximum of 16 amino acids per line, with a space provided between each amino acid.
    - (3) An amino acid sequence shall be represented in the amino to carboxy direction, from left to right, and the amino and carboxy groups shall not be represented in the sequence.
    - (4) The enumeration of amino acids may start at the first amino acid of the first mature protein, with the number 1. When represented, the amino acids preceding the mature protein, (_e.g.,_ pre‑sequences, pro-sequences, pre‑pro-sequences, and signal sequences) shall have negative numbers, counting backwards starting with the amino acid next to number 1. Otherwise, the enumeration of amino acids shall start at the first amino acid at the amino terminal as number 1, and shall appear below every five amino acids of the sequence. The enumeration method for amino acid sequences that is set forth in this section remains applicable for amino acid sequences that are circular in configuration, with the exception that the designation of the first amino acid of the sequence may be made at the option of the applicant.
    - (5) An amino acid sequence that contains internal terminator symbols (_e.g.,_ "Ter," "*," or ".," etc.) may not be represented as a single amino acid sequence but shall be represented as separate amino acid sequences.
- **Note 3 to paragraph (d):** Appendices A through F to this subpart contain Tables 1– 6 of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Handbook on Industrial Property Information and Documentation, Standard ST.25: Standard for the Presentation of Nucleotide and Amino Acid Sequence Listings in Patent Applications (2009).
- (e) A sequence with a gap or gaps shall be represented as a plurality of separate sequences, with separate sequence identifiers (§ **[1.823(a)(5)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333837.html##ar_it_337f1_2121b_346)** ), with the number of separate sequences being equal in number to the number of continuous strings of sequence data. A sequence composed of one or more noncontiguous segments of a larger sequence or segments from different sequences shall be presented as a separate sequence.

The symbols for representing the nucleotide and/or amino acid characters in the sequences are set forth in Appendices A and C to Subpart G of Part 1 of the CFR. See **[MPEP § 2422](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e242638.html)**(I). No other symbols shall be used in nucleotide and amino acid sequences. The "modified base" and "modified and unusual amino acid" symbols appearing in Appendices B and D to Subpart G of Part 1 of the CFR (see **[37 CFR 1.822](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333753.html##ar_it_337f1_20b9e_38b)**  and **[MPEP § 2422](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e242638.html)**(I)) are not to be set forth in the sequences recited in the "Sequence Listing". However, "modified base" or "modified and unusual amino acid" symbols may be used in the written description and/or drawing portions of the specification. To properly enter notations for modified bases or amino acids in the "Sequence Listing", the Feature section of the "Sequence Listing" should be used. That is, a modified base or amino acid may be presented in a given sequence as the corresponding unmodified base or amino acid if the modified base or amino acid is one of those listed in Appendices B and D to Subpart G of Part 1 of the CFR and the modification is also set forth in the Feature section of the "Sequence Listing". Otherwise, all nucleotide bases or amino acids not appearing in Appendices A and C to Subpart G of Part 1 of the CFR must be listed in a given sequence as "n" or "Xaa," respectively, with further information given in the Feature section of the "Sequence Listing" by including one or more feature keys listed in Appendices E and F to Subpart G of Part 1 of the CFR. See **[37 CFR 1.822(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333753.html##d0e333765)**.

In **[37 CFR 1.822(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333753.html)**  and **[37 CFR 1.822(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333753.html)**, the use of three-letter symbols for amino acids is required in the "Sequence Listing". The three-letter symbols must be presented using the upper case for the first character and lower case for the remaining two characters. Applicants are encouraged to use the three-letter symbols for amino acids throughout the disclosure, instead of the one-letter symbols, for easier reading of the application and any patent issuing therefrom.

**[37 CFR 1.822(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333753.html)**  through **[(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333753.html##d0e333830)**  set forth the format for presenting sequence data.

# 2423.02    Depiction of Coding Regions [R-07.2022]

_[Editor Note: This section is not applicable to applications filed on or after July 1, 2022, having disclosures of nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences as defined in **[37 CFR 1.831(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ar_d35d57_1bdc8_2b8.html##ar_it_35d57_211e4_8c)**.

If applicant chooses to depict coding regions, **[37 CFR 1.822(c)(3)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333753.html)**  requires the amino acids corresponding to the codons in the coding parts of a nucleotide sequence to be listed immediately below the corresponding codons. Further, in **[37 CFR 1.822(c)(3)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333753.html)**, the situation in which a codon spans an intron has been addressed. In those situations, the "amino acid symbol shall be listed below the portion of the codon containing two nucleotides." This requirement clarifies the representation of an amino acid that corresponds to a codon that spans an intron.

It should be noted that the sequence rules do not, in any way, require the depiction of coding regions or the amino acids corresponding to the codons in those coding regions. **[37 CFR 1.822(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333753.html)**  only requires that where amino acids corresponding to the codons in the coding parts of a nucleotide sequence are depicted, they must be depicted below the corresponding codons. There is absolutely no requirement in the rules to depict coding regions. However, when the coding parts of a nucleotide sequence and their corresponding amino acids have been enumerated by their residues, those amino acids must also be set forth as a separate sequence if the amino acid sequence meets the length thresholds in **[37 CFR 1.821(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html##d0e333661)**.

That is, double stranded nucleotides shall not be represented in the "Sequence Listing". A double stranded nucleotide may be represented as two single stranded nucleotides, and any relationship between the two may be shown in the drawings.

The procedures for presenting and numbering amino acid sequences are set forth in **[37 CFR 1.822(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333753.html)**. Two alternatives are presented for numbering amino acid sequences. Amino acid sequences may be numbered with respect to the identification of the first amino acid of the first mature protein or with respect to the first amino acid appearing at the amino terminal. The numbering procedure for nucleotides is set forth in **[37 CFR 1.822(c)(6)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333753.html)**. Sequences that are circular in configuration are intended to be encompassed by these rules, and the numbering procedures described above remain applicable with the exception that the designation of the first nucleotide base or amino acid of the sequence may be made at the option of the applicant. See **[37 CFR 1.822(c)(7)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333753.html##d0e333798)**  and **[(d)(4)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333753.html##d0e333816)**.

In **[37 CFR 1.822(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333753.html)**  the procedures for presenting and numbering hybrid and gapped sequences are set forth. A sequence with a gap or gaps shall be presented as a plurality of separate sequences, each having separate sequence identifiers, with the number of separate sequences being equal in number to the number of continuous strings of sequence data. The term "gap" is not intended to embrace a gap or gaps that is/are introduced into the presentation of otherwise continuous sequence information in, e.g., a drawing figure, to show alignments or similarities with other sequences. The "gaps" referred to in this section are gaps representing unknown or undisclosed regions in a sequence between regions that are known or disclosed. On the other hand, a sequence that contains one or more regions of contiguous "n" or "Xaa" residues, wherein the exact number of "n" or "Xaa" residues in each region is disclosed, must be included in the "Sequence Listing" as a single sequence with a single sequence identifier. A sequence disclosed by enumeration of its residues that is constructed as a single continuous sequence from one or more non-contiguous segments of a larger sequence or segments from different sequences must be included in the "Sequence Listing" as a single sequence with a single sequence identifier. A fragment of a larger sequence need not be enumerated by its residues, and may be referred to in the specification, claims or drawings as, e.g., "residues 2 through 33 of SEQ ID NO:12," assuming that SEQ ID NO:12 has been properly included in the "Sequence Listing".

**[37 CFR 1.825](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e334511.html)**  sets forth the procedures for adding or replacing the "Sequence Listing" and the CRF thereof. Under **[37 CFR 1.825(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e334511.html##d0e334519)**, adding a "Sequence Listing" after the application filing date involves the submission of: (1) a "Sequence Listing" either as a PDF image file, on physical sheets of paper, or as an ASCII plain text file submitted via the USPTO patent electronic filing system or on read-only optical disc(s), (2) a request that the amendment be made by either incorporation by reference in the case of ASCII plain text files or inserting text into the specification in the case of PDF image files or physical sheets of paper, (3) a statement that indicate the basis for the amendment in the application, as originally filed, (4) a statement that the "Sequence Listing" includes no new matter, (5) a new or substitute CRF when the submission is a PDF image file or on physical sheets of paper, and (6) a statement that the sequence information contained in the CRF is the same as the sequence information contained in the added "Sequence Listing" when the submission is a PDF image file or on physical sheets of paper. (See **[MPEP § 2428](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e247518.html)** for further information and sample statements.) If the "Sequence Listing" is filed as an ASCII plain text file only, thereby serving both as a "Sequence Listing" under **[37 CFR 1.821(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html##d0e333702)**  and a CRF under **[37 CFR 1.821(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html##d0e333722)**, then an incorporation by reference statement is required in the specification (replacing any prior such paragraph) (see **[37 CFR 1.77(b)(5)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e320555.html##d0e320614)** ). If the "Sequence Listing" is filed as a PDF image file or on physical sheets of paper, then the "Sequence Listing" must be placed after the abstract of the disclosure. Also, if the added "Sequence Listing" is submitted as a PDF image file or on physical sheets of paper and a separate CRF under **[37 CFR 1.821(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html##d0e333722)**  was either not submitted, not compliant with **[37 CFR 1.824](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e334418.html)**, or not the same as the submitted "Sequence Listing", then a new or substitute separate CRF is required along with a statement that the sequence information contained in the CRF is the same as the sequence information contained in the added "Sequence Listing". It is noted that an incorporation by reference statement should not be submitted for a separate CRF of a "Sequence Listing" submitted under **[37 CFR 1.821(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html##d0e333722)**.

Under **[37 CFR 1.825(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e334511.html##d0e334532)**, amending the "Sequence Listing" involves the submission of a replacement "Sequence Listing" either as a PDF image file, on physical sheets of paper, or as an ASCII plain text file submitted via the USPTO patent electronic filing system or on read-only optical disc(s), in conjunction with statements that identify the location of all deletions, replacements, or additions to the "Sequence Listing", indicate the basis for the amendment in the application, as originally filed, and that the replacement "Sequence Listing" includes no new matter. (See **[MPEP § 2428](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e247518.html)** for further information and sample statements.) These statements may be made by a registered practitioner, the applicant, an inventor, or the person who actually compares the sequence data on behalf of the aforementioned. It is noted that any amendment to the information on a read-only optical disc must be by the way of a replacement read-only optical disc. **[37 CFR 1.52(e)(7)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e318327.html##d0e318620)**. If the replacement "Sequence Listing" is filed as an ASCII plain text file, then an incorporation by reference statement is required in the specification (replacing any prior such paragraph) (see **[37 CFR 1.77(b)(5)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e320555.html##d0e320614)** ). If the replacement "Sequence Listing" is filed as a PDF image file or on physical sheets of paper, then the replacement "Sequence Listing" must be placed after the abstract of the disclosure. Also, if the replacement "Sequence Listing" is submitted as a PDF image file or on physical sheets of paper and a separate CRF under **[37 CFR 1.821(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html##d0e333722)**  was either not submitted, not compliant with **[37 CFR 1.824](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e334418.html)**, or not the same as the submitted "Sequence Listing", then a new or substitute separate CRF is required along with a statement that the sequence information contained in the CRF is the same as the sequence information contained in the replacement "Sequence Listing". It is noted that an incorporation by reference statement should not be submitted for a separate CRF of a "Sequence Listing" submitted under **[37 CFR 1.821(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html##d0e333722)**. If the "Sequence Listing" required by **[37 CFR 1.821(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html##d0e333702)**  was filed on a read-only optical disc that included files in addition to the "Sequence Listing", a replacement read-only optical disc containing the amended "Sequence Listing" also must contain all of the files of the original read-only optical disc that were not amended. This will ensure that the Office, printer, and public can quickly access all of the current files in an application or patent by referencing only the latest version.

The requirement for statements regarding the absence of new matter follows current practice relating to the submission of substitute specifications, as set forth in **[37 CFR 1.125](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e323278.html)**. **[37 CFR 1.825(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e334511.html##d0e334539)**  requires that the specification must be amended to contain an incorporation by reference statement of the material contained in a "Sequence Listing" ASCII plain text file if the "Sequence Listing" ASCII plain text file was filed on the application filing date without an incorporation by reference statement, except if the "Sequence Listing" ASCII plain text file was filed on the application filing date of an international application regardless of whether the international application is currently in the international stage or the national stage. **[37 CFR 1.825(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e334511.html##d0e334546)**  addresses the situation where amendments to the "Sequence Listing" are made after a patent has been granted, e.g., by a certificate of correction, reissue or reexamination, and states that such amendments must comply with the requirements of **[37 CFR 1.825(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e334511.html##d0e334532)**.

In order to expedite the processing of applications, minor errors pertaining to compliance with the sequence rules discovered after examination has begun may be handled with the next Office action. Examples of minor errors are: missing any necessary sequence identifiers in the specification/drawings; missing or providing an incomplete incorporation by reference of the "Sequence Listing" in the specification (if required); and missing statement that the sequence information contained in the "Sequence Listing" is identical to the sequence information contained in the computer readable form (if required). Since the application is ready for examination, the examiner may act on the application and include any objections to the application based on minor errors related to the "Sequence Listing" or the CRF of the "Sequence Listing" with the Office action.

Sample language for the statements required to support sequence rule submissions is provided below. These statements are given by way of example only and are not exhaustive; other language may, of course, be used. For the statements that relate to the assertion that the sequence information contained in the PDF image file or the physical sheets of paper and the computer readable form are "identical" or "the same," it is acknowledged that there may be some non-substantive differences between the two, e.g., page numbers and page breaks may be present in the PDF image file or the physical sheets of paper but not in the computer readable form thereof. This requirement for sameness relates to the informational content of the PDF image file or the physical sheets of paper and the CRF relevant to the requirements of the sequence rules.

The Office has the following tips regarding sequence rules in compliance with WIPO ST.25.

—Compliance is not a filing date issue.

—Compliance is not a **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302824.html)**  issue.

—Compliance is not a **[35 U.S.C. 119](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e302921.html)** /**[120](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e303023313.html)**  issue.

—Compliance is not _per se_ a new matter issue. The standard for resolution of inconsistencies between the "Sequence Listing" (submitted as an ASCII plain text file, on read-only optical disc(s), as a PDF image file, or on physical sheets of paper pursuant to **[37 CFR 1.821(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html)** ) and a separate computer readable form thereof pursuant to **[37 CFR 1.821(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html##d0e333722)**  (if required) and/or errors in the "Sequence Listing" is based on the new matter standard.

—Compliance can be achieved via amendment. See **[MPEP § 2426](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e246991.html)** for additional information regarding amendments to add or replace a "Sequence Listing" and CRF thereof. See **[37 CFR 1.825](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e334511.html)**.

—If sequence information is submitted in an application filed under **[35 U.S.C. 111(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//pltd0e302673aia.html##pltd0e302678aia)**  or **[35 U.S.C. 371](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e307164.html)**  as an ASCII plain text file in compliance with **[37 CFR 1.824](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e334418.html)**  via the USPTO patent electronic filing system or on read-only optical disc(s) and applicant has not filed a "Sequence Listing" as a PDF image file or on physical sheets of paper, the ASCII plain text file will serve as both the "Sequence Listing" under **[37 CFR 1.821(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html)**  and the CRF of the "Sequence Listing" under **[37 CFR 1.821(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html##d0e333722)**.

—The USPTO encourages applicants to file their patent applications via the USPTO patent electronic filing system and imposes a surcharge for non-electronic filing of an original patent application (excluding reissue, design, plant, and provisional applications). Filing a "Sequence Listing" via USPTO patent electronic filing system as a PDF image file or on physical sheets of paper is not recommended. A "Sequence Listing" in PDF format or on physical sheets of paper is treated as the "Sequence Listing" required by **[37 CFR 1.821(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html)**  and requires filing of both a separate CRF and a statement that the "Sequence Listing" and the CRF are identical in an application filed under **[35 U.S.C. 111(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//pltd0e302673aia.html##pltd0e302678aia)**  regardless of if the sequence information is also filed as an ASCII plain text file, as required by **[37 CFR 1.821(e)(1)(ii)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html##ar_it_337f1_20354_31)**, and in a national stage application filed under **[35 U.S.C. 371](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e307164.html)**  if the sequence information is not also filed as an ASCII plain text file, as required by **[37 CFR 1.821(e)(2)(ii)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html##ar_it_337f1_20740_5e)**. In addition, a "Sequence Listing" submitted in PDF format or on physical sheets of paper as part of the specification is not excluded when determining the application size fee required by **[37 CFR 1.16(s)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e314702.html##ar_d1fca6_2c71a_190)**  or **[1.492(j)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e329162.html##d0e329435)**. See **[37 CFR 1.52(f)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e318327.html##d0e318625)**  and **[(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e318327.html##d0e318662)**.

—For international applications (PCT), the check list of the PCT Request filed with the international application must contain an indication that the sequence listing, filed with the PCT application on the international filing date forms part of the international application. See **[MPEP § 2422.03(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//ch2400_d24b1e_175aa_27c.html)**, subsection IV, for information specific to filing sequence listings in international applications (PCT) via the USPTO patent electronic filing system.

—Applicants are reminded that for fee purposes, a table of sequences is not a "Sequence Listing". Such tables are considered part of the specification and are included when determining the application size fee required by **[37 CFR 1.16(s)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e314702.html##d0e315174)**  or **[1.492(j)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e329162.html##d0e329435)**. See **[37 CFR 1.52(f)(1) and (2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e318327.html##d0e318625)**.

—Applicants are encouraged to draft their specifications such that sequence data that is not essential material is not required to be included in a "Sequence Listing". **[37 CFR 1.21(o)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e316474.html##d0e316751)**  and **[1.52(f)(3)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e318327.html##ar_it_3383b_1e5fa_7d)**  provide that the submission of an oversized "Sequence Listing" (a mega-"Sequence Listing") of 300 MB or more are subject to additional fees. A mega-"Sequence Listing", in particular, often include sequences that are available in the prior art, are not essential material, and could have been described instead, for example, by name and a publication or accession reference.

—Failure to reply to sequence compliance issues in a timely manner may reduce any patent term adjustment. Patent applications filed under **[35 U.S.C. 111(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//pltd0e302673aia.html##pltd0e302678aia)**  on or after December 18, 2013, and international patent applications in which the national stage commenced under **[35 U.S.C. 371](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e307164.html)**  on or after December 18, 2013, may be subject to reductions in patent terms adjustment pursuant to **[37 CFR 1.704(c)(13)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//plt_20130401_d0e331597.html##ar_d24a61_22a69_24d)**  if they are not in condition for examination within eight months from the filing date or date of commencement, respectively. "In condition for examination" includes compliance with **[37 CFR 1.821](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html)**  - **[1.825](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e334511.html)**  (see **[37 CFR 1.704(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//plt_20130401_d0e331597.html##ar_d24abc_25d16_162)** ).

—The copy of the "Sequence Listing" required by **[37 CFR 1.821(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html)**  is an integral part of the application. If submitted as a PDF image file or on physical sheets of paper, the "Sequence Listing" must begin on a new page, should appear at the end of the application, and preferably should be numbered independently of the numbering of the remainder of the application. The new page that begins the "Sequence Listing" should be entitled "Sequence Listing." See **[37 CFR 1.823(b)(3)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333837.html##ar_it_337f1_22349_3bb)**. If not submitted as such at filing, the "Sequence Listing" must be inserted into the application via amendment, e.g., by preliminary amendment. See **[37 CFR 1.825](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e334511.html)**. If submitted as an ASCII plain text file via the USPTO patent electronic filing system or read-only optical disc, the specification must contain an incorporation by reference of the material, except for a national stage entry under **[37 CFR 1.495(b)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//aia_d0e329467.html##aia_d0e329486)**, where the "Sequence Listing" has been previously communicated to the International Bureau or originally filed in the USPTO and complies with Patent Cooperation Treaty **[Rule 5.2](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e366450.html##d0e366501)**.

—A replacement "Sequence Listing" must be used to amend a "Sequence Listing" regardless of whether the "Sequence Listing" was filed as an ASCII plain text file via the USPTO patent electronic filing system, on read-only optical disc(s) (**[37 CFR 1.821(c)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html##ar_it_337f1_201ad_14c)**, as a PDF file via the USPTO patent electronic filing system (**[37 CFR 1.821(c)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html##ar_it_337f1_201e3_302)**, or on physical sheets of paper (**[37 CFR 1.821(c)(3)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html##ar_it_337f1_2021f_f2)**. See **[MPEP § 2426](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e246991.html)** for additional information regarding amendments to add or replace a "Sequence Listing" and CRF copy thereof.

—The practice of computer readable form transfers from one application to another has been eliminated.

—Angle brackets and numeric identifiers listed in **[37 CFR 1.823](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333837.html)**  and Appendix G to Subpart G of Part 1 of the CFR (reproduced in **[MPEP § 2424](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e245667.html)**) are very important for our database. Extra punctuation should not be used in a "Sequence Listing".

—A "Sequence Listing" (**[37 CFR 1.821(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html)** ) or a separate CRF of a "Sequence Listing" (**[37 CFR 1.821(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html##d0e333722)** ) as an ASCII plain text file cannot contain page numbers. Page numbers should only be placed on PDF image files or on physical sheets of paper of the "Sequence Listing".

—The PatentIn computer program is not the only means by which to comply with the rules. Any word processing program can be used to generate a "Sequence Listing" if it has the capability to convert a file into ASCII plain text. However, use of a word processing program to generate or amend a "Sequence Listing" file is discouraged. Word processing programs often introduce unintended changes to the "Sequence Listing" that render the listing unacceptable. Use of a plain text editor to generate or edit a "Sequence Listing" is recommended.

—If a word processing program is used to generate a "Sequence Listing", hard page break controls should not be used and margins should be adjusted to the smallest setting.

—Word processing files should not be submitted to the Office; the "Sequence Listing" generated by a word processing file should be saved as an ASCII plain text file for submission. Most word processing programs provide this feature.

—Statements in accordance with **[37 CFR 1.821(e)(1)(ii)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html##ar_it_337f1_20354_31)**, **[(e)(2)(ii)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html##ar_it_337f1_20740_5e)**, **[(e)(3)(iii)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html##ar_it_337f1_20806_36)**, and **[(h)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html##d0e333746)**  and **[37 CFR 1.825(a)(3)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e334511.html##ar_it_337f1_25c57_2cc)**, **[(a)(4)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e334511.html##ar_it_337f1_25c70_2c8)**, **[(a)(6)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e334511.html##ar_it_337f1_25cc8_278)**, **[(b)(3)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e334511.html##ar_it_337f1_25e63_35f)**, **[(b)(4)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e334511.html##ar_it_337f1_25e75_1e1)**, **[(b)(5)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e334511.html##ar_it_337f1_25ead_350)**, and **[(b)(7)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e334511.html##ar_it_337f1_25ece_376)**  and proper labeling for read-only optical disc(s) in accordance with **[37 CFR 1.52(e)(5)(vi)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e318327.html##ar_it_337ef_1eb25_266)**  should be noted. Sample statements to support filings and submissions in accordance with **[37 CFR 1.821](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html)**  through **[1.825](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e334511.html)**  are provided in **[MPEP § 2428](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e247518.html)** Sample Statements.

—Use Box SEQUENCE. See **[MPEP § 2433](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e245470.html)**.

—On nucleotide sequences, since only single strands may be depicted in the "Sequence Listing", show strands in 5' to 3' direction from left to right in accordance with **[37 CFR 1.822(c)(5)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333753.html##d0e333790)**.

—The single stranded nucleotide depicted in the "Sequence Listing" may represent a strand of a nucleotide sequence that may be single or double stranded which may be, further, linear or circular. An amino acid sequence or peptide may be linear or circular.

—Numeric identifiers "<140>, Current Application Number," "<141>, Current Filing Date," "<150>, Prior Application Number," and "<151>, Prior Application Filing Date," should appear in the "Sequence Listing" in all cases. If the information about the current application is not known or is unavailable at the time of completing the "Sequence Listing", then the lines following numeric identifiers <140> and <141> should be left blank. This would normally be the case when the "Sequence Listing" is included in a newly filed application. Similarly, if information regarding prior applications is inapplicable, or not known at the time of completing the "Sequence Listing" but will be later filed, then the numeric identifiers <150> and <151> should appear with the line following the numeric identifiers left blank.

—The mandatory items of information that must be included in a "Sequence Listing" are identified in the table of numeric identifiers set forth Appendix G to Subpart G of Part 1 of the CFR. See also **[MPEP § 2424.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e246289.html)**.

—Pursuant to **[37 CFR 1.83(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e320967.html##d0e320975)**, sequences that are included in a "Sequence Listing" should not be duplicated in the drawings. However, significant sequence characteristics that are not readily conveyed by the data in the "Sequence Listing" may be depicted in a drawing figure. However, the sequence information so conveyed must still be included in a "Sequence Listing" if the sequence falls within the definition set forth in **[37 CFR 1.821(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html##d0e333661)**, and the sequence identifier ("SEQ ID NO:X or the like") must be used, either in the drawing or in the "Brief Description of the Drawings." See **[MPEP § 2422.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e245175.html)** for additional information.

—Inosine may be represented by the use of "I" in the features section, otherwise use "n."

—Stop codons that are represented by an asterisk are not permitted in amino acid sequences.

—Punctuation should not be used in a sequence to indicate unknown nucleotide bases or amino acid residues or to delimit active or functional regions of a sequence. These regions should be noted as Features of the sequence per Appendix G to Subpart G of Part 1 of the CFR (see numeric identifiers <220> - <223>. (Appendix G is reproduced in **[MPEP § 2424](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e245667.html)**).

—The presence of an unnatural amino acid in a sequence does not have the same effect as the presence of a D-amino acid. The sequence may still be subject to the rules even though one or more of the amino acids is not naturally occurring.

—Cyclic and branched peptides are causing some confusion in the application of the rules. Specific questions should be directed to Sequence Systems Service Center of the Scientific and Technical Information Center at 571-272-2510.

—A cyclic peptide with a tail is regarded as a branched sequence, and thereby exempt from the rules, if all bonds adjacent to the amino acid from which the tail emanates are normal peptide bonds.

—Sequences that have variable-length regions depicted as, for example, Ala Ala Leu Leu (Xaa Xaa)n Ile Pro where n=0-234 or agccttgggaca(nnnnn)mgtcatt where m=0-354 or Ser Met Ala Xaa Ser where Xaa could be 1, 2, 3, 4 and/or 5 amino acids must still comply with the Sequence Rules. The method to use is to repeat the variable-length region as many times as the maximum length and specify in the Features section that the amino acid (or nucleotide) at a specified position is either absent or present. The variables Xaa and n may stand for only one residue, hence the need to repeat the variable. The correct way to submit the third example is Ser Met Ala Xaa Xaa Xaa Xaa Xaa Ser combined with an explanation in the Features section of the listing that any one or all of amino acids 4-8 can either be present or absent.

—Single letter amino acid abbreviations are not acceptable within the "Sequence Listing" but may appear elsewhere in the application.

—Zero (0) is not used when the numbering of amino acids uses negative numbers to distinguish the mature protein.

—Subscripts or superscripts are not permitted in a "Sequence Listing".

—The exclusive conformance requirement of **[37 CFR 1.821(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html)**  requires that any amendment of the sequence information in a "Sequence Listing" be accompanied by an amendment to the corresponding information, if any, embedded in the text of the specification or presented in a drawing figure.

—A mandatory feature is required to cover every "n" or "Xaa" used in a sequence. The feature consists of numeric identifiers <220>, <221>, <222>, and <223>. Numeric identifier <220> should remain blank, numeric Identifier <221> should be selected from Appendices E and F to Subpart G of Part 1 of the CFR (reproduced in **[MPEP § 2422](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e242638.html)**(I)), numeric identifier <222> should identify the location of the "n" or "Xaa" within the sequence, and numeric identifier should <223> specify what the "n" or "Xaa" can be. When all of the "n" or "Xaa" variables in a sequence are equal to the same thing, a range of the entire sequence can be given for numeric identifier <222> to cover all of the "n" or "Xaa" designators in one feature.

—Remove all non-ASCII characters from the .txt file. For example, an α symbol should be spelled out as "alpha."

—Tabs are non-ASCII characters. Do not use tabs in "Sequence Listing" .txt files.

—Make all explanations in a feature section consistent with the molecule type in numeric identifier <212>. For example, if the sequence is type "PRT" do not describe the sequence in a feature section as a "synthetic oligonucleotide."

—A response for numeric identifier <130>, "File Reference," is mandatory if the numeric identifier <140> is not present, e.g., when the "Sequence Listing" is filed before the application number has been assigned. At least one of a numeric identifier <130> with docket number or numeric identifier <140> with current application number must be in the "Sequence Listing". This information is used to ensure that ASCII plain text files are correctly matched to their corresponding applications.

—If a "Sequence Listing" is modified by the addition or deletion of sequences, remember to update the total number of sequences in numeric identifier <160>.

—Numeric identifier <213> can only be one of three choices: Scientific name (i.e. Genus/species), Unknown, or Artificial Sequence. Do not add any extraneous information about the sequence, such as a gene names, in this field. Do not use common names for species. For example, human should be "Homo sapiens" and cow should be "Bos taurus." If a specific genus/species is unknown, use the reply "Unknown" in numeric identifier <213> and add whatever information is known into numeric identifier <223> of the feature section. For example, if only the family "Saccharomycetaceae" is known, numeric identifier <213> should state "Unknown" and numeric identifier <223> could state "fungus of the family Saccharomycetaceae."

—For all sequences using "Unknown" or "Artificial sequence" for numeric identifier <213>, a mandatory feature is required to explain the source of the genetic material. The feature consists of <220>, which remains blank, and <223>, which states the source of the genetic material. To explain the source, if the sequence is put together from several organisms, please list those organisms. If the sequence is made in the laboratory, please indicate that the sequence is synthesized.

—Only use abbreviations that are specifically defined in "WIPO Standard ST.25 (2009)" or that are well known. Do not use abbreviations that are specific to the application at issue and would not be clear to someone who had not read the invention description. When in doubt, use the full name rather than an abbreviation.

—Note that if a "Sequence Listing" provided as an ASCII plain text file or a separate CRF of a "Sequence Listing" is rejected and an error report issued, the errors listed are exemplary and may not be a complete list of all errors in the "Sequence Listing" file. The applicant is required to review the "Sequence Listing" in its entirety and correct all instances of similar errors.

—Any inquiries regarding a specific "Sequence Listing" provided as an ASCII plain text file or a separate CRF of a "Sequence Listing" that has been processed by the Office should be directed to the Sequence Systems Service Center of the Scientific and Technical Information Center at 571-272-2510.

In those areas of biotechnology in which nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence information is significant, many patent applicants are accustomed to, or familiar with, the submission of such sequence information, in electronic form, to various sequence databases, such as GenBank, which is produced by the National Institutes of Health. In order to facilitate such submissions, or merely for the purpose of researching and developing sequence information, many eventual patent applicants also generate or encode sequence information in computer readable form. In order to further facilitate compliance with the sequence rules, the Office previously made available to the public an input program based on the AuthorIn program produced by GenBank. This input program, called PatentIn version 1.3, was specifically tailored to the requirements of the sequence rules which were in effect between October 1, 1990 and July 1, 1998. Applications filed in the U.S. or in member countries of WIPO after July 1, 1998, containing sequence listings prepared using PatentIn version 1.3 will not be in compliance with **[37 CFR 1.821](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html)** -**[1.825](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e334511.html)**  or ST.25.

The current sequence rules, which are embodied in **[37 CFR 1.821](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e333653.html)** -**[1.825](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e334511.html)**  and World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Standard ST.25, became effective July 1, 1998. Several versions of PatentIn have been released since 1998.

PatentIn version 3.5.1, available as of November 2010, and the companion User’s Manual, are available on the Office website (**[www.uspto.gov/patents/basics/types- patent-applications/utility-patent/checker/patentin](https://www.uspto.gov/patents-getting-started/patent-basics/types-patent-applications/utility-patent/patentin-version-351)** ) for free downloading. PatentIn 3.5.1 operates in a Windows environment.

For help related to downloading the PatentIn software program or using PatentIn, contact the Patent Electronic Business Center at 866-217-9197 or via email at ebc@uspto.gov.

While use of the PatentIn program is not required for compliance with the sequence rules, its use is highly recommended, as Office experience has shown that submissions developed with PatentIn are far less likely to include errors than those developed without the program. The many automatic features of the PatentIn program also greatly ease the generation of a "Sequence Listing" when compared to generating them by hand in a word processing environment. This is especially true for a "Sequence Listing" that includes many sequences and/or sequences having great lengths.

Checker software that may be used to check a "Sequence Listing" for compliance with the requirements of **[37 CFR 1.824](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e334418.html)**  is available on the USPTO website at **[(www.uspto.gov/patents/basics/types- patent-applications/utility-patent/checker/patentin](https://www.uspto.gov/patents-getting-started/patent-basics/types-patent-applications/utility-patent/patentin-version-351)**. The User Notes on the Checker website should be consulted for an explanation of errors that are not indicated, and content that is not verified, by the Checker software.

# 2433    Box Sequence; Hand Delivery of a "Sequence Listing" and Computer Readable Forms [R-07.2022]

To facilitate administrative processing of all papers and read-only optical discs associated with sequence rule compliance, all computer readable forms, read-only optical discs, fees, and papers accompanying them filed in the Office should be marked "Box SEQUENCE."

Correspondence relating to the sequence rules may also be hand-delivered to the Customer Service Window. In cases of hand delivery to the Customer Service Window, the computer readable form should be placed in a protective mailer labeled with at least the application number, if available. The labeling requirements of **[37 CFR 1.52(e)(4)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e318327.html##d0e318575)**  must also be complied with. In no circumstances should additional or complimentary electronic copies be delivered to examiners or other Office personnel.

# 2434    Examination of Patent Applications Claiming Large Numbers of Nucleotide Sequences [R-07.2022]

Polynucleotide molecules defined by their nucleic acid sequence (hereinafter "nucleotide sequences") that encode different proteins are structurally distinct chemical compounds. These sequences are thus deemed to normally constitute independent and distinct inventions within the meaning of **[35 U.S.C. 121](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e303040.html)**. Absent evidence to the contrary, each such nucleotide sequence is presumed to represent an independent and distinct invention, subject to a restriction requirement pursuant to **[35 U.S.C. 121](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e303040.html)**  and **[37 CFR 1.141](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e324081.html)**  _et seq._

All pending applications are subject to _Examination of Patent Applications Containing Nucleotide Sequences,_ 1316 OG 123 (March 27, 2007). Note, however, that supplemental restriction requirements will not be advanced in applications that have already received an action on their merits in the absence of extenuating circumstances. For national applications filed under **[35 U.S.C. 111(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//pltd0e302673aia.html##pltd0e302678aia)**, polynucleotide inventions will be considered for restriction, rejoinder, and examination practice in accordance with the standards set forth in **[MPEP Chapter 800](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e97826.html)**. Claims to polynucleotide molecules will be considered for independence, relatedness, distinction and burden in the same manner as claims to any other type of molecule.

See **[MPEP § 1850](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e175250.html)** for treatment of claims containing nucleotide sequences that lack unity of invention in international applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) and national stage applications filed under **[35 U.S.C. 371](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e307164.html)**.

# 2435    Publishing of Patents and Patent Application Publications with a Lengthy "Sequence Listing" [R-07.2022]

Due to the high cost and limited usefulness of the printed paper or composed electronic image versions of nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences, if the "Sequence Listing" portion is lengthy (i.e., at least 600 Kb (about 300 typed pages)), it will no longer be printed with the paper and composed electronic image (page image) versions of patents and patent application publications. The "Sequence Listing" will only be published in electronic form and will be available on the USPTO sequence homepage (**[https://seqdata.uspto.gov](http://seqdata.uspto.gov/)** ) as an ASCII plain text file.

Copies of patents and patent application publications that include sequence listings are available for sale through the Patent and Trademark Copy Fulfillment Branch’s Certified Copy Center storefront at **[https://certifiedcopycenter.uspto.gov/](https://certifiedcopycenter.uspto.gov/)**. However, these copies will not include a "Sequence Listing" if the "Sequence Listing" is not included in the composed electronic image (page image) version of the patent or patent application publication.

Copies of U.S. patents and U.S. patent application publications are not provided in paper to applicants and are not placed in the application file. See **[MPEP § 707.05(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e73580.html)**. If an applicant desires an electronic copy of a "Sequence Listing", applicant may either download the "Sequence Listing" from the USPTO sequence homepage (**[https://seqdata.uspto.gov/](https://seqdata.uspto.gov/)** ) or specifically request and pay for the electronic copy through the Patent and Trademark Copy Fulfillment Branch of the Public Records Division. Both applicants and members of the general public can obtain an electronic copy of the "Sequence Listing" through the Patent and Trademark Copy Fulfillment Branch for a separate fee as set forth in **[37 CFR 1.19(b)(3)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e315991.html##d0e316158)**. See **[MPEP § 1730](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e163385.html)** for contact information for the Patent and Trademark Copy Fulfillment Branch.

If the patent is mailed to applicant, the Office will include a copy of the patent on paper and a copy of the "Sequence Listing" on an electronic medium (e.g., read-only optical disc), if the "Sequence Listing" is not printed in the patent.

If the "Sequence Listing" is not included in the page images of a patent or patent application publication, a standardized statement will appear. Additionally, in the electronic text version of the patent or patent application publication, the statement will include an active hyperlink to a Web page containing the "Sequence Listing". The standardized statement for a patent will read, for example:

**"SEQUENCE LISTING"**

The patent contains a lengthy "Sequence Listing" section. A copy of the "Sequence Listing" is available in electronic form from the USPTO web site (**[https://seqdata.uspto.gov](http://seqdata.uspto.gov/)** ). An electronic copy of the "Sequence Listing" will also be available from the USPTO upon request and payment of the fee set forth in **[37 CFR 1.19(b)(3)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e315991.html)**.

The standardized statement for a patent application publication will read, for example:

**"SEQUENCE LISTING"**

The patent application contains a lengthy "Sequence Listing" section. A copy of the "Sequence Listing" is available in electronic form from the USPTO web site (**[https://seqdata.uspto.gov](http://seqdata.uspto.gov/)** ). An electronic copy of the "Sequence Listing" will also be available from the USPTO upon request and payment of the fee set forth in **[37 CFR 1.19(b)(3)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e315991.html)**.

Sequence data may also be accessed in a more readily searchable manner from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) at **[www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)**  or from a commercial vendor. The USPTO forwards a copy of the sequence data to NCBI when a patent including a "Sequence Listing" is granted, and when an application containing a sequence is published pursuant to **[35 U.S.C. 122(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e240552.html#//d0e303054.html)**. If NCBI elects to include the sequence data in one of its databases, NCBI indexes the sequence data according to patent or patent application publication number. There is currently no fee for the public to use the NCBI site.
