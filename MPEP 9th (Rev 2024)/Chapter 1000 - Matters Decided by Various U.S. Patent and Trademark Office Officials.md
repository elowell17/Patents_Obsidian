# 1001.01    Modes of Exercising Authority [R-07.2015]

The authority of the Director of the USPTO to review and supervise the work of the Office is exercised by the promulgation of the Rules of Practice; issuance of orders, notices and memoranda stating Office policies and modes for effectuating these policies; decisions on petitions by applicants; and by the designation of particular cases which must be submitted to the Director of the USPTO or other officials authorized by the Director of the USPTO. The present Chapter deals with the latter two items. The line of demarcation between appealable matters for the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (Board) and petitionable matters for the Director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (Director) should be carefully observed. The Board will not ordinarily hear a question that should be decided by the Director on petition, and the Director will not ordinarily entertain a petition where the question presented is a matter appealable to the Board. See **[MPEP Chapter 1200](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e115995.html#//d0e122292.html)** for more information on appealable matters.

**[37 CFR 1.181(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e115995.html#//d0e324913.html)**  states, "The Director may delegate to appropriate Patent and Trademark Office officials the determination of petitions."

The various delegations to various Office officials are set forth in this Chapter.

The delegations set forth in this Chapter do not confer a right to have a matter decided by a specific Office official, rather, such delegations aid in the efficient treatment of petitions by the Office. A delegation of supervisory or higher level review authority over a matter carries with it the authority to decide the matter _ab initio._

# 1002    Petitions to the Director of the USPTO [R-07.2022]

#### _37 C.F.R. 1.4  Nature of correspondence and signature requirements._

*****

- (c) Since different matters may be considered by different branches or sections of the Office, each distinct subject, inquiry or order must be contained in a separate paper to avoid confusion and delay in answering papers dealing with different subjects. Subjects provided for on a single Office or World Intellectual Property Organization form may be contained in a single paper.

*****

#### _37 C.F.R. 1.181   Petition to the Director._

- (a) Petition may be taken to the Director:
    - (1) From any action or requirement of any examiner in the _ex parte_ prosecution of an application, or in _ex parte_ or _inter partes_ prosecution of a reexamination proceeding which is not subject to appeal to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board or to the court;
    - (2) In cases in which a statute or the rules specify that the matter is to be determined directly by or reviewed by the Director; and
    - (3) To invoke the supervisory authority of the Director in appropriate circumstances. For petitions involving action of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, see § **[41.3](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e115995.html#//d0e355820.html)**  of this title.
- (b) Any such petition must contain a statement of the facts involved and the point or points to be reviewed and the action requested. Briefs or memoranda, if any, in support thereof should accompany or be embodied in the petition; and where facts are to be proven, the proof in the form of affidavits or declarations (and exhibits, if any) must accompany the petition.
- (c) When a petition is taken from an action or requirement of an examiner in the _ex parte_ prosecution of an application, or in the _ex parte_ or _inter partes_ prosecution of a reexamination proceeding, it may be required that there have been a proper request for reconsideration (§ **[1.111](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e115995.html#//d0e322449.html)** ) and a repeated action by the examiner. The examiner may be directed by the Director to furnish a written statement, within a specified time, setting forth the reasons for his or her decision upon the matters averred in the petition, supplying a copy to the petitioner.
- (d) Where a fee is required for a petition to the Director the appropriate section of this part will so indicate. If any required fee does not accompany the petition, the petition will be dismissed.
- (e) Oral hearing will not be granted except when considered necessary by the Director.
- (f) The mere filing of a petition will not stay any period for reply that may be running against the application, nor act as a stay of other proceedings. Any petition under this part not filed within two months of the mailing date of the action or notice from which relief is requested may be dismissed as untimely, except as otherwise provided. This two-month period is not extendable.
- (g) The Director may delegate to appropriate Patent and Trademark Office officials the determination of petitions.

#### _37 C.F.R. 1.182   Questions not specifically provided for._

All situations not specifically provided for in the regulations of this part will be decided in accordance with the merits of each situation by or under the authority of the Director, subject to such other requirements as may be imposed, and such decision will be communicated to the interested parties in writing. Any petition seeking a decision under this section must be accompanied by the petition fee set forth in §  **[1.17(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e115995.html#//eff_20130320_d0e315199.html##eff_20130320_d0e315345)**.

#### _37 C.F.R. 1.183   Suspension of rules._

In an extraordinary situation, when justice requires, any requirement of the regulations in this part which is not a requirement of the statutes may be suspended or waived by the Director or the Director’s designee, _sua sponte,_ or on petition of the interested party, subject to such other requirements as may be imposed. Any petition under this section must be accompanied by the petition fee set forth in §  **[1.17(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e115995.html#//eff_20130320_d0e315199.html##eff_20130320_d0e315345)**.

Petitions on appealable matters ordinarily are not entertained. See **[MPEP § 1201](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e115995.html#//d0e122296.html)**.

A petition should include:

- 1. A statement of the type of relief requested and the authorizing provision of statute or rules, if applicable;
- 2. A statement of the relevant facts;
- 3. An identification of the points that are to be reviewed; and
- 4. The fee, where required.

**[37 CFR 1.4(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e115995.html#//d0e313174.html##d0e313234)**  requires a separate petition for each distinct subject, inquiry or order to avoid confusion and delay in answering the petition. Therefore, each petition should ordinarily only be filed under a single authorizing provision (e.g., **[37 CFR 1.181](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e115995.html#//d0e324913.html)** ). Although concurrent petitions seeking relief from the same action may be filed, many prior petitioners have benefitted by delaying the filing of petitions under **[37 CFR 1.182](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e115995.html#//d0e324988.html)**  or **[1.183](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e115995.html#//d0e325004.html)**  until after they receive a decision on a petition seeking supervisory review under **[37 CFR 1.181](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e115995.html#//d0e324913.html)**.

The mere filing of a petition will not stay the period for replying to an examiner’s action which may be running against an application, nor act as a stay of other proceedings (**[37 CFR 1.181(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e115995.html#//d0e324913.html)** ). For example, if a petition to vacate a final rejection as premature is filed within 2 months from the date of the final rejection, the period for reply to the final rejection is not extended even if the petition is not reached for decision within that period. However, if the petition is granted and the applicant has filed an otherwise full reply to the rejection _within the period for reply,_ the case is not abandoned.

**[37 CFR 1.181(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e115995.html#//d0e324913.html)**  provides that any petition under that rule which is not filed "within two months of the mailing date of the action or notice from which relief is requested may be dismissed as untimely." Often, the "action or notice from which relief is requested," for example, a requirement for a new drawing, is included in the same letter as an action on the merits of the claims, the latter having a 3-month period for reply. Under such circumstances, if applicant requests reconsideration, under **[37 CFR 1.111(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e115995.html#//d0e322449.html)**, of the requirement for a new drawing, the examiner’s action on this request, if adverse, establishes the beginning of the 2-month period for filing the petition. The petition must be filed within this period even though the period for reply to the rejection of the claims may extend beyond the 2-month period. The 2-month period for filing timely petitions set forth in **[37 CFR 1.181(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e115995.html#//d0e324913.html)**  applies to any petition under **[37 CFR part 1](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e115995.html#//d0e312937.html)**, except as otherwise provided. A number of sections (e.g., **[37 CFR 1.377](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e115995.html#//d0e327097.html)**, **[1.378](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e115995.html#//d0e327126.html)**, and **[1.740](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e115995.html#//d0e332100.html)** ) specify the time period within which a petition must be filed (or may be dismissed as untimely). The 2-month time period in **[37 CFR 1.181(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e115995.html#//d0e324913.html)**  applies to a petition under any section (e.g., **[37 CFR 1.182](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e115995.html#//d0e324988.html)**  and **[37 CFR 1.183](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e115995.html#//d0e325004.html)** ) that does not specify the time period within which a petition must be filed. The 2-month period is not extendible under **[37 CFR 1.136(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e115995.html#//d0e323655.html)**  since the time is within the discretion of the Director of the USPTO.

**[37 CFR 1.181(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e115995.html#//d0e324913.html)**  authorizes deciding officials to reasonably exercise discretion to accept a petition filed more than 2 months after the date of the action or notice from which relief is requested. A deciding official should not accept a petition after the 2-month period without a reason because the 2-month period provides for minimal undue delay in patent prosecution ("The Office has long considered the two-month period in **[§ 1.181(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e115995.html#//d0e324913.html)**  to be the benchmark for determining the timeliness of petitions." _Changes to Implement the Patent Business Goals,_ 65 FR 54603, 54646 (September 8, 2000) (citing _Changes to Patent Practice and Procedure,_ 62 FR 53132, 53161 (October 10, 1997))). The deciding official may exercise their discretion to accept an untimely petition beyond the 2-month period in the circumstance that doing so would avoid unnecessary delays in the prosecution of the application. When a petition subject to **[37 CFR 1.181(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e115995.html#//d0e324913.html)**  is filed after the 2-month period from the mailing date of the action or notice from which relief is requested and is accepted at the discretion of the deciding official, the reason for accepting the untimely petition should be articulated in the decision to ensure clarity of the record. The following non-exhaustive factors may be considered to determine whether to accept a petition after the 2-month period:

- (1) Petitioner engaged in significant, constructive efforts with the examiner to resolve the issue outside of the petitions process
- (2) The examiner agreed, on the written record, to perform an action that would resolve the issue, but failed to do so
- (3) A showing of extenuating circumstances, such as delay caused by health, pandemic, natural disaster, etc.

If the deciding official determines that the petition will be dismissed as untimely, the decision should include an explanation of how the 2-month period was calculated. The decision should inform petitioner that arguments on the issue of timeliness may be presented in a renewed petition.

The mere filing of a petition will not stay the period for replying to an examiner’s action which may be running against an application, nor act as a stay of other proceedings (**[37 CFR 1.181(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e115995.html#//d0e324913.html)** ).

Form paragraph 10.20 may be used where an insufficient fee was filed with a petition or a request.

# ¶ 10.20    Petition or Request Dismissed, Proper Fee Not Submitted

Applicant’s petition or request under 37 CFR **[1]** filed **[2]** is DISMISSED because the proper petition or processing fee of **[3]** required under **[37 CFR 1.17](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e115995.html#//eff_20130320_d0e315199.html)**  has not been submitted.

# 1002.01    Procedure [R-07.2015]

Petitions, together with the respective application files, are sent to the official having the delegated authority to decide the petition. The petition may be referred to the examiner for a formal statement under **[37 CFR 1.181(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e115995.html#//d0e324913.html)**  or for an informal memorandum. See **[MPEP § 711.03(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e115995.html#//d0e83996.html)**.

Where a formal statement under **[37 CFR 1.181(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e115995.html#//d0e324913.html)**  is made, a copy thereof is mailed to the petitioner by the examiner unless the examiner is otherwise directed, and the application file and petition, accompanied by the original copy of his or her statement, are returned to the official handling the petition. If an informal memorandum is requested, no copy thereof is mailed to the petitioner by the examiner.

# 1002.02    Delegation of Authority To Decide Petitions [R-07.2022]

Petitions to the Director of the USPTO are decided in accordance with the following delegation of authority.

In any case in which the authority to decide the petition has been delegated as indicated in **[MPEP §§ 1002.02(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e115995.html#//d0e116658.html)**, **[1002.02(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e115995.html#//d0e117599.html)**, **[1002.02(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e115995.html#//d0e117688.html)**, **[1002.02(j)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e115995.html#//d0e117752.html)**, **[1002.02(o)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e115995.html#//d0e117912.html)**, and **[1002.02(p)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e115995.html#//d0e117971.html)**, a denial of a petition is a final agency decision. A dismissal of a petition, a denial of a petition without prejudice, and other interlocutory orders are not final agency decisions.

Petitions decided by the Technology Center Directors are set forth in **[MPEP § 1002.02(c) et seq.](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e115995.html#//d0e116970.html)** A petition decided under the delegated authority set forth in **[MPEP § 1002.02(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e115995.html#//d0e116970.html)** should not use language that suggests that it is a final agency decision. Therefore, a petition decided by a Technology Center Director in which the requested relief is not granted should be dismissed rather than denied. Additionally, the decision should indicate that it is not a final agency decision. To promote consistency and enhance clarity of petition decisions by Technology Center Directors, the following language may be used when a petition decided by a Technology Center Director is dismissed:

"The petition filed [date X] is dismissed. This is not a final agency decision. See **[MPEP § 1002.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e115995.html#//d0e116602.html)**. Any request for reconsideration or higher level review of this decision not filed within two months of the mailing date of this decision may be dismissed as untimely. This two-month period is not extendable. See **[37 CFR 1.181(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e115995.html#//d0e324913.html##d0e324977)**."

In accordance with **[37 CFR 1.181(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e115995.html#//d0e324913.html)**, the authority to decide petitions to the Director of the USPTO not otherwise delegated, has been delegated to various Office officials. Generally, these officials will decide petitions as specified in the following sections for the effective operation of the Office. Also listed are certain petitions which are not, strictly speaking, to the Director of the USPTO but have been committed by statute or rule to the designated officials.

The delegation of specific petitions and/or matters to the Technology Center (TC) Directors is identified in the sections below. Unless specifically provided for in the letter of delegation of authority, further delegations are not permitted. Any petitions and/or matters so delegated by the TC Directors may be decided by the TC Directors.

Authority not herein delegated has been reserved to the Director of the USPTO and may be delegated to appropriate officials on an _ad hoc_ basis.

# 1002.02(a)    [Reserved]

# 1002.02(b)    Petitions and Requests Decided by the Deputy Commissioner Who Oversees the Office of Petitions or Assigned Staff in the Office of Petitions, the Office of Patent Legal Administration and the MPEP Staff Office [R-01.2024]

In general, petitions under this section should be directed to "Mail Stop Petition, Commissioner for Patents, P.O. Box 1450, Alexandria, Virginia 22313-1450," except as otherwise provided. For example, applications for patent term extension under **[35 U.S.C. 156](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e115995.html#//d0e303884.html)**  should be directed to Mail Stop Hatch-Waxman PTE and petitions for retroactive foreign filing license under **[37 CFR 5.25](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e115995.html#//d0e337707.html)**  should be directed to Mail Stop L&R.
