# 2103    Patent Examination Process [R-07.2022]

## I.    **DETERMINE WHAT INVENTION IS SOUGHT TO BE PATENTED**

It is essential that patent applicants obtain a prompt yet complete examination of their applications. Under the principles of compact prosecution, each claim should be reviewed for compliance with every statutory requirement for patentability in the initial review of the application, even if one or more claims are found to be deficient with respect to some statutory requirement. Thus, examiners should state all reasons and bases for rejecting claims in the first Office action. Deficiencies should be explained clearly, particularly when they serve as a basis for a rejection. Whenever practicable, examiners and patent reexamination specialists should indicate how rejections may be overcome and how problems may be resolved. Where a rejection not based on prior art is proper (lack of adequate written description, enablement, or utility, etc.) such rejection should be stated with a full development of the reasons rather than by a mere conclusion. A failure to follow this approach can lead to unnecessary delays in the prosecution of the application.

The examination of reissue applications is covered in **[MPEP Chapter 1400](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e134581.html)**, reexamination proceedings are covered in **[MPEP Chapters 2200](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e220689.html)** (_ex parte_) and **[2600](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e249708.html)** (_inter partes_), and supplemental examination is covered in **[MPEP Chapter 2800](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2800_d1fea8_279ab_9.html)**.

Prior to focusing on specific statutory requirements, examiners must begin examination by determining what, precisely, the inventor or joint inventor has invented and is seeking to patent, and how the claims relate to and define that invention. Examiners will review the complete specification, including the detailed description of the invention, any specific embodiments that have been disclosed, the claims and any specific, substantial, and credible utilities that have been asserted for the invention.

After obtaining an understanding of the invention, the examiner will conduct a search of the prior art and determine whether the invention as claimed complies with all statutory requirements.

## A.    **_Identify and Understand Any Utility for the Invention_**

The claimed invention as a whole must be useful. The purpose of this requirement is to limit patent protection to inventions that possess a certain level of "real world" value, as opposed to subject matter that represents nothing more than an idea or concept, or is simply a starting point for future investigation or research _(Brenner v. Manson,_ 383 U.S. 519, 528-36, 148 USPQ 689, 693-96 (1966); _In re Fisher,_ 421 F.3d 1365, 76 USPQ2d 1225 (Fed. Cir. 2005); _In re Ziegler,_ 992 F.2d 1197, 1200-03, 26 USPQ2d 1600, 1603-06 (Fed. Cir. 1993)).

Examiners should review the application to identify any asserted utility. The applicant or the inventor is in the best position to explain why an invention is useful. Accordingly, a complete disclosure should contain some indication of the practical application for the claimed invention, i.e., why the applicant asserts the claimed invention is useful. Such a statement will usually explain the purpose of the invention or how the invention may be used (e.g., a compound is believed to be useful in the treatment of a particular disorder). Note that the concept of a "practical application" in the evaluation of utility is different from the concept of whether a judicial exception is integrated into a "practical application" in the evaluation of subject matter eligibility. Regardless of the form of statement of utility, it must enable one ordinarily skilled in the art to understand why the applicant asserts the claimed invention is useful. See **[MPEP § 2106](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e197244.html)** for subject matter eligibility guidelines and **[MPEP § 2107](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e198469.html)** for utility examination guidelines. The application may describe more than one utility and practical application, but only one is necessary. Alternatively, an applicant may rely on the contemporaneous art to provide that the claimed invention has a well-established utility.

## B.    **_Review the Detailed Disclosure and Specific Embodiments of the Invention To Understand What the Applicant Has Asserted as the Invention_**

The written description will provide the clearest explanation of the invention, by exemplifying the invention, explaining how it relates to the prior art and explaining the relative significance of various features of the invention. Accordingly, examiners should continue their evaluation by:

- (A) determining the function of the invention, that is, what the invention does when used as disclosed (e.g., the functionality of a programmed computer); and
- (B) determining the features necessary to accomplish at least one asserted practical application.

Patent applicants can assist the USPTO by preparing applications that clearly set forth these aspects of an invention.

## C.    **_Review the Claims_**

The claims define the property rights provided by a patent, and thus require careful scrutiny. The goal of claim analysis is to identify the boundaries of the protection sought by the applicant and to understand how the claims relate to and define what the applicant has indicated is the invention. Examiners must first determine the scope of a claim by thoroughly analyzing the language of the claim before determining if the claim complies with each statutory requirement for patentability. See _In re Hiniker Co.,_ 150 F.3d 1362, 1369, 47 USPQ2d 1523, 1529 (Fed. Cir. 1998) ("[T]he name of the game is the claim.").

Examiners should begin claim analysis by identifying and evaluating each claim limitation. For processes, the claim limitations will define steps or acts to be performed. For products, the claim limitations will define discrete physical structures or materials. Product claims are claims that are directed to either machines, manufactures or compositions of matter.

Examiners should then correlate each claim limitation to all portions of the disclosure that describe the claim limitation. This is to be done in all cases, regardless of whether the claimed invention is defined using means- (or step-) plus- function language. The correlation step will ensure that examiners correctly interpret each claim limitation in light of the specification.

The subject matter of a properly construed claim is defined by the terms that limit the scope of the claim when given their broadest reasonable interpretation. It is this subject matter that must be examined. As a general matter, grammar and the plain meaning of terms as understood by one having ordinary skill in the art used in a claim will dictate whether, and to what extent, the language limits the claim scope. See **[MPEP § 2111.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e200409.html)** for more information on the plain meaning of claim language. Language that suggests or makes a feature or step optional but does not require that feature or step does not limit the scope of a claim under the broadest reasonable claim interpretation. The following types of claim language may raise a question as to its limiting effect:

- (A) statements of intended use or field of use, including statements of purpose or intended use in the preamble,
- (B) "adapted to" or "adapted for" clauses,
- (C) "wherein" or "whereby" clauses,
- (D) contingent limitations,
- (E) printed matter, or
- (F) terms with associated functional language.

This list of examples is not intended to be exhaustive. The determination of whether particular language is a limitation in a claim depends on the specific facts of the case. See, e.g., _Griffin v. Bertina,_ 285 F.3d 1029, 1034, 62 USPQ2d 1431 (Fed. Cir. 2002)(finding that a "wherein" clause limited a process claim where the clause gave "meaning and purpose to the manipulative steps"). For more information about these types of claim language and how to determine whether they have a limiting effect on claim scope, see **[MPEP §§ 2111.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e200689.html)** through **[2111.05](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d1b148_1ea0c_2c0.html)**.

Examiners are to give claims their broadest reasonable interpretation in light of the supporting disclosure. See **[MPEP § 2111](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e200352.html)**. Disclosure may be express, implicit, or inherent. Examiners are to give claimed means- (or step-) plus- function limitations their broadest reasonable interpretation consistent with all corresponding structures (or materials or acts) described in the specification and their equivalents. See _In re Aoyama,_ 656 F.3d 1293, 1297, 99 USPQ2d 1936, 1939 (Fed. Cir. 2011). Further guidance in interpreting the scope of equivalents is provided in **[MPEP §§ 2181](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e219279.html)** through **[2186](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e220631.html)**.

While it is appropriate to use the specification to determine what applicant intends a term to mean, a positive limitation from the specification cannot be read into a claim that does not itself impose that limitation. See **[MPEP § 2111.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e200409.html)**, subsection II. As explained in **[MPEP § 2111](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e200352.html)**, giving a claim its broadest reasonable interpretation during prosecution will reduce the possibility that the claim, when issued, will be interpreted more broadly than is justified.

Finally, when evaluating the scope of a claim, every limitation in the claim must be considered. Examiners may not dissect a claimed invention into discrete elements and then evaluate the elements in isolation. Instead, the claim as a whole must be considered. See, e.g., _Diamond v. Diehr,_ 450 U.S. 175, 188-89, 209 USPQ 1, 9 (1981) ("In determining the eligibility of respondents’ claimed process for patent protection under **[§ 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**, their claims must be considered as a whole. It is inappropriate to dissect the claims into old and new elements and then to ignore the presence of the old elements in the analysis. This is particularly true in a process claim because a new combination of steps in a process may be patentable even though all the constituents of the combination were well known and in common use before the combination was made.").

## II.    **CONDUCT A THOROUGH SEARCH OF THE PRIOR ART**

Prior to evaluating the claimed invention for patentability, examiners are expected to conduct a thorough search of the prior art. See **[MPEP §§ 904](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e115569.html)** through **[904.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e115840.html)** for more information about how to conduct a search. In many cases, the result of such a search will contribute to examiners' understanding of the invention. Both claimed and unclaimed aspects of the invention described in the specification should be searched if there is a reasonable expectation that the unclaimed aspects may be later claimed. A search must take into account any structure or material described in the specification and its equivalents which correspond to the claimed means- (or step-) plus- function limitation, in accordance with **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**  and **[MPEP § 2181](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e219279.html)** through **[MPEP § 2186](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e220631.html)**.

## III.    **DETERMINE WHETHER THE CLAIMED INVENTION COMPLIES WITH 35 U.S.C. 101**

## A.    **_Consider the Breadth of 35 U.S.C. 101 Under Controlling Law_**

**[Section 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  of title 35, United States Code, provides:

> Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions and requirements of this title.

**[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  has been interpreted as imposing four requirements: (i) only one patent may be obtained for an invention; (ii) the inventor(s) must be identified in an application filed on or after September 16, 2012 or must be the applicant in applications filed before September 16, 2012; (iii) the claimed invention must be eligible for patenting; and (iv) the claimed invention must be useful (have utility).

See **[MPEP § 2104](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d1b13f_1b012_1f4.html)** for a discussion of the four requirements, **[MPEP § 2106](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e197244.html)** for a discussion of eligibility, and **[MPEP § 2107](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e198469.html)** for the utility examination guidelines.

The patent eligibility inquiry under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  is a threshold inquiry. Even if a claimed invention qualifies as eligible subject matter under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**, it must also satisfy the other conditions and requirements of the patent laws, including the requirements for novelty (**[35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302383.html)** ), nonobviousness (**[35 U.S.C. 103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302450.html)** ), and adequate description and definite claiming (**[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824.html)** ). _Bilski v. Kappos,_ 561 U.S. 593, 602, 95 USPQ2d 1001, 1006 (2010). Therefore, examiners should avoid focusing on only issues of patent-eligibility under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  to the detriment of considering an application for compliance with the requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302383.html)**, **[35 U.S.C. 103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302450.html)**, and **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824.html)**, and should avoid treating an application solely on the basis of patent-eligibility under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  except in the most extreme cases.

## IV.    **EVALUATE APPLICATION FOR COMPLIANCE WITH 35 U.S.C. 112**

## A.    **_Determine Whether the Claimed Invention Complies with 35 U.S.C. 112(b) or Pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112, Second Paragraph Requirements_**

**[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)**  contains two separate and distinct requirements: (A) that the claim(s) set forth the subject matter the inventor or a joint inventor regards as the invention, and (B) that the claim(s) particularly point out and distinctly claim the invention. An application will be deficient under the first requirement of **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)**  when evidence outside the application as filed, e.g., admissions, shows that the inventor or a joint inventor regards the invention to be different from what is claimed (see **[MPEP § 2171](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e217389.html)** - **[MPEP § 2172.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e217526.html)**).

An application fails to comply with the second requirement of **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)**  when the claims do not set out and define the invention with a reasonable degree of precision and particularity. In this regard, the definiteness of the language must be analyzed, not in a vacuum, but always in light of the teachings of the disclosure as it would be interpreted by one of ordinary skill in the art. Applicant’s claims, interpreted in light of the disclosure, must reasonably apprise a person of ordinary skill in the art of the invention.

The scope of a limitation that invokes **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**  is defined as the corresponding structure or material set forth in the written description and equivalents thereof that perform the claimed function. See **[MPEP § 2181](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e219279.html)** through **[MPEP § 2186](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e220631.html)**. See **[MPEP § 2173](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e217564.html)** _et seq._ for a discussion of a variety of issues pertaining to the **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)**  requirement that the claims particularly point out and distinctly claim the invention.

## B.    **_Determine Whether the Claimed Invention Complies with 35 U.S.C. 112(a) or 35 U.S.C. 112, First Paragraph Requirements_**

**[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**  contains three separate and distinct requirements:

- (A) adequate written description,
- (B) enablement, and
- (C) best mode.

## 1.    **Adequate Written Description**

For the written description requirement, an applicant’s specification must reasonably convey to those skilled in the art that the inventor was in possession of the claimed invention as of the date of invention. See **[MPEP § 2163](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e213583.html)** for further guidance with respect to the evaluation of a patent application for compliance with the written description requirement.

## 2.    **Enabling Disclosure**

An applicant’s specification must enable a person skilled in the art to make and use the claimed invention without undue experimentation. The fact that experimentation is complex, however, will not make it undue if a person of skill in the art routinely engages in such experimentation.

See **[MPEP § 2164](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e215224.html)** _et seq._ for detailed guidance with regard to the enablement requirement of **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**.

## 3.    **Best Mode**

Determining compliance with the best mode requirement requires a two-prong inquiry:

- (1) at the time the application was filed, did the inventor possess a best mode for practicing the invention; and
- (2) if the inventor did possess a best mode, does the written description disclose the best mode in such a manner that a person of ordinary skill in the art could practice the best mode.

See **[MPEP § 2165](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e216924.html)** _et seq._ for additional guidance. Deficiencies related to disclosure of the best mode for carrying out the claimed invention are not usually encountered during examination of an application because evidence to support such a deficiency is seldom in the record. _Fonar Corp. v. General Elec. Co.,_ 107 F.3d 1543, 1548-49, 41 USPQ2d 1801, 1804-05 (Fed. Cir. 1997).

## V.    **DETERMINE WHETHER THE CLAIMED INVENTION COMPLIES WITH 35 U.S.C. 102 AND 103**

Reviewing a claimed invention for compliance with **[35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302383.html)**  and **[35 U.S.C.103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302450.html)**  begins with a comparison of the claimed subject matter to what is known in the prior art. See **[MPEP §§ 2131](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e202959.html)** - **[2146](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e213206.html)** and **[MPEP §§ 2150](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d2002f_22805_16e.html)** - **[2159](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d20034_1dc34_1dd.html)** for specific guidance on patentability determinations under **[35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302383.html)**  and **[35 U.S.C. 103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302450.html)**. If no differences are found between the claimed invention and the prior art, then the claimed invention lacks novelty and is to be rejected by USPTO personnel under **[35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302383.html)**. Once differences are identified between the claimed invention and the prior art, those differences must be assessed and resolved in light of the knowledge possessed by a person of ordinary skill in the art. Against this backdrop, one must determine whether the invention would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art. If not, the claimed invention satisfies **[35 U.S.C. 103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302450.html)**.

## VI.    **CLEARLY COMMUNICATE FINDINGS, CONCLUSIONS AND THEIR BASES**

Once examiners have completed the above analyses of the claimed invention under all the statutory provisions, including **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**, **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824.html)**, **[35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302383.html)**, and **[35 U.S.C. 103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302450.html)**, they should review all the proposed rejections and their bases to confirm that a _prima facie_ case of unpatentability exists. Only then should any rejection be imposed in an Office action. The Office action should clearly communicate the findings, conclusions and reasons which support them.

EXAMINERS SHOULD USE THE APPLICABLE FORM PARAGRAPHS IN OFFICE ACTIONS TO STATE THE BASIS FOR ANY OBJECTIONS OR REJECTIONS TO REDUCE THE CHANCE OF A MISUNDERSTANDING AS TO THE GROUNDS OF OBJECTION OR REJECTION.

# 2104    Requirements of 35 U.S.C. 101 [R-07.2022]

Patents are not granted for all new and useful inventions and discoveries. For example, the subject matter of the invention or discovery must come within the boundaries set forth by **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**, which permits a patent to be granted only for "any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof."

#### _35 U.S.C. 101   Inventions patentable._

Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions and requirements of this title.

**[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  has been interpreted as imposing four requirements, which are described below.

## I.    **DOUBLE PATENTING PROHIBITED**

**[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  requires that whoever invents or discovers an eligible invention may obtain only ONE patent therefor. Thus, it prevents two patents issuing on the same invention to the same inventor (i.e., the same inventive entity) or where there is a common (joint) inventor or common applicant/assignee. The "same invention" means that identical subject matter is being claimed. This requirement forms the basis for statutory double patenting rejections. If more than one patent is sought, a patent applicant will receive a statutory double patenting rejection for claims included in more than one application that are directed to the same invention.

See **[MPEP § 804](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e98894.html)** for a full discussion of the prohibition against double patenting. Use form paragraphs **[8.30](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//fp8.30.html)**, **[8.31](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//fp8.31.html)** and **[8.32](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//fp8.32.html)** for statutory double patenting rejections.

## II.    **NAMING OF INVENTOR**

The inventor(s) must be the applicant in an application filed before September 16, 2012, (except as otherwise provided in **[pre-AIA 37 CFR 1.41(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e317666.html##d0e317757)** ) and the inventor or each joint inventor must be identified in an application filed on or after September 16, 2012. See **[MPEP § 2109](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d2c183_22374_28b.html)** for a detailed discussion of inventorship and **[MPEP § 602.01(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e4830ss602.html)** _et seq._ for details regarding correction of inventorship.

In the rare situation where it is clear the application does not name the correct inventorship and the applicant has not filed a request to correct inventorship under **[37 CFR 1.48](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e317930.html)**, the examiner should reject the claims under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  and **[115](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302875912.html)**  for applications subject to **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//al_d1fbe1_234ed_52.html)**  (see **[MPEP § 2157](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d20034_1bb92_e7.html)**) or under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302383.html##d0e302420)**  for applications subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302383.html)**  (see **[MPEP § 2137](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e206570.html)**).

## III.    **SUBJECT MATTER ELIGIBILITY**

A claimed invention must be eligible for patenting. As explained in **[MPEP § 2106](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e197244.html)**, there are two criteria for determining subject matter eligibility: (a) first, a claimed invention must fall within one of the four statutory categories of invention set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**, i.e., process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter; and (b) second, a claimed invention must be directed to patent-eligible subject matter and not a judicial exception (unless the claim as a whole includes additional limitations amounting to significantly more than the exception). The judicial exceptions are subject matter which courts have found to be outside of, or exceptions to, the four statutory categories of invention, and are limited to abstract ideas, laws of nature and natural phenomena (including products of nature). _Alice Corp. Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank Int'l,_ 573 U.S. 208, 216, 110 USPQ2d 1976, 1980 (2014) (citing _Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc.,_ 569 U.S. 66, 70, 106 USPQ2d 1972, 1979 (2013)). See also _Bilski v. Kappos,_ 561 U.S. 593, 601, 95 USPQ2d 1001, 1005-06 (2010) (citing _Diamond v. Chakrabarty,_ 447 U.S. 303, 309, 206 USPQ 193, 197 (1980)).

See **[MPEP § 2106](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e197244.html)** for a discussion of subject matter eligibility in general, and the analytical framework that is to be used during examination for evaluating whether a claim is drawn to patent-eligible subject matter, **[MPEP § 2106.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_139b2_397.html)** for a discussion of the statutory categories of invention, **[MPEP § 2106.04](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_139db_e0.html)** for a discussion of the judicial exceptions, and **[MPEP § 2106.05](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13c11_1cb.html)** for a discussion of how to evaluate claims directed to a judicial exception for eligibility. See **[MPEP § 2106.07(a)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d2c183_20b8d_1b9.html)** for form paragraphs for use in rejections under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  based on a lack of subject matter eligibility. See also **[MPEP § 2105](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e197008.html)** for more information about claiming living subject matter, as well as the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA)'s prohibition against claiming human organisms.

Eligible subject matter is further limited by the Atomic Energy Act explained in **[MPEP § 2104.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d2c188_18a96_2d4.html)**, which prohibits patents granted on any invention or discovery that is useful solely in the utilization of special nuclear material or atomic energy in an atomic weapon.

## IV.    **UTILITY**

A claimed invention must be useful or have a utility that is specific, substantial and credible.

A rejection on the ground of lack of utility is appropriate when (1) it is not apparent why the invention is "useful" because applicant has failed to identify any specific and substantial utility and there is no well established utility, or (2) an assertion of specific and substantial utility for the invention is not credible. Such a rejection can include the more specific grounds of inoperativeness, such as inventions involving perpetual motion. A rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  for lack of utility should not be based on grounds that the invention is frivolous, fraudulent or against public policy. See _Juicy Whip Inc. v. Orange Bang Inc.,_ 185 F.3d 1364, 1367-68, 51 USPQ2d 1700, 1702-03 (Fed. Cir. 1999) ("[Y]ears ago courts invalidated patents on gambling devices on the ground that they were immoral…, but that is no longer the law…Congress never intended that the patent laws should displace the police powers of the States, meaning by that term those powers by which the health, good order, peace and general welfare of the community are promoted…we find no basis in section 101 to hold that inventions can be ruled unpatentable for lack of utility simply because they have the capacity to fool some members of the public.").

The statutory basis for this rejection is **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**. See **[MPEP § 2107](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e198469.html)** for guidelines governing rejections for lack of utility. See **[MPEP §§ 2107.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e198682.html)** - **[2107.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e200058.html)** for legal precedent governing the utility requirement. See **[MPEP § 2107.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e199419.html)**, subsection IV, for form paragraphs to be used to reject claims under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  for failure to satisfy the utility requirement.

# 2104.01    Barred by Atomic Energy Act [R-07.2022]

A limitation on what can be patented is imposed by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. Section 151(a) (42 U.S.C. 2181(a)) thereof reads in part as follows:

No patent shall hereafter be granted for any invention or discovery which is useful solely in the utilization of special nuclear material or atomic energy in an atomic weapon.

The terms "atomic energy" and "special nuclear material" are defined in Section 11 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2014).

Sections 151(c) and 151(d) (42 U.S.C. 2181(c) and (d)) set up categories of pending applications relating to atomic energy that must be brought to the attention of the Department of Energy. Under **[37 CFR 1.14(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e314245.html)**, applications for patents which disclose or which appear to disclose, or which purport to disclose, inventions or discoveries relating to atomic energy are reported to the Department of Energy and the Department will be given access to such applications, but such reporting does not constitute a determination that the subject matter of each application so reported is in fact useful or an invention or discovery or that such application in fact discloses subject matter in categories specified by the Atomic Energy Act.

All applications received in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office are screened by Licensing and Review personnel, under **[37 CFR 1.14(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e314245.html)**, in order for the Director to fulfill his or her responsibilities under section 151(d) (42 U.S.C. 2181(d)) of the Atomic Energy Act. Papers subsequently added must be inspected promptly by the examiner when received to determine whether the application has been amended to relate to atomic energy and those so related must be promptly forwarded to Licensing and Review.

All rejections based upon sections 151(a) (42 U.S.C. 2181(a)), 152 (42 U.S.C. 2182), and 155 (42 U.S.C. 2185) of the Atomic Energy Act must be made only by Licensing and Review personnel.

# 2105    Patent Eligible Subject Matter — Living Subject Matter [R-10.2019]

## I.    **INTRODUCTION**

Prior to 1980, it was widely believed that living subject matter was not eligible for patenting, either because such subject matter did not fall within a statutory category, or because it was a judicial exception to patent eligibility. However, the decision of the Supreme Court in _Diamond v. Chakrabarty,_ 447 U.S. 303, 206 USPQ 193 (1980), made it clear that the question of whether an invention embraces living matter is irrelevant to the issue of patent eligibility. Note, however, that Congress has excluded claims directed to or encompassing a human organism from eligibility. See The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA), Pub. L. 112-29, sec. 33(a), 125 Stat. 284 (September 16, 2011).

## II.    **LIVING SUBJECT MATTER MAY BE PATENT ELIGIBLE**

## A.    **_Living Subject Matter May Be Directed To A Statutory Category_**

In _Chakrabarty,_ the Supreme Court held that a claim to a genetically engineered bacterium was directed to at least one of the four statutory categories, because the bacterium was a "manufacture" and/or a "composition of matter." In its opinion, the Court stated that "Congress plainly contemplated that the patent laws would be given wide scope" because it chose to draft **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  using "such expansive terms as ‘manufacture’ and ‘composition of matter,’ modified by the comprehensive ‘any.’" 447 U.S. at 308, 206 USPQ at 197. The Court also determined that the distinction between living and inanimate things was not relevant for subject matter eligibility. 447 U.S. at 313, 206 USPQ at 199. Thus, the Court held that living subject matter with markedly different characteristics from any found in nature, such as the claimed bacterium produced by genetic engineering, is not excluded from patent protection by **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**. 447 U.S. at 310, 206 USPQ at 197.

Following the reasoning in _Chakrabarty,_ the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences determined that animals are patentable subject matter under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**. In _Ex parte Allen,_ 2 USPQ2d 1425 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1987), the Board decided that a non-naturally occurring polyploid Pacific coast oyster could have been the proper subject of a patent under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  if all the criteria for patentability were satisfied. Shortly after the _Allen_ decision, the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks issued a notice (Animals - Patentability, 1077 O.G. 24, April 21, 1987) stating that the Patent and Trademark Office "now considers nonnaturally occurring, non-human multicellular living organisms, including animals, to be patentable subject matter within the scope of **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**."

With respect to plant subject matter, the Supreme Court held that patentable subject matter under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  includes newly developed plant breeds, even though plant protection is also available under the Plant Patent Act (**[35 U.S.C. 161](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e304416.html)**  - **[164](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e304454.html)** ) and the Plant Variety Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 2321 _et. seq._). _J.E.M. Ag Supply, Inc. v. Pioneer Hi-Bred Int’ l, Inc.,_ 534 U.S. 124, 143-46, 60 USPQ2d 1865, 1874 (2001) (The scope of coverage of **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  is not limited by the Plant Patent Act or the Plant Variety Protection Act; each statute can be regarded as effective because of its different requirements and protections).

See **[MPEP § 2106.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_139b2_397.html)** for a discussion of the categories of statutory subject matter.

## B.    **_Living Subject Matter May Be Eligible for Patent Protection_**

The Supreme Court in _Chakrabarty_ held a claim to a genetically engineered bacterium eligible, because the claimed bacterium was not a "product of nature" exception. As the Court explained, the modified bacterium was patentable because the patent claim was not to a "hitherto unknown natural phenomenon," but instead had "markedly different characteristics from any found in nature," due to the additional plasmids and resultant capacity for degrading oil. 447 U.S. at 309-10, 206 USPQ at 197.

Subsequent judicial decisions have made clear that the Supreme Court’s decision in _Chakrabarty_ is "central" to the eligibility inquiry with respect to nature-based products. See, _e.g., Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc.,_ 569 U.S. 576, 590, 106 USPQ2d 1972, 1979 (2013). For example, the Federal Circuit has indicated that "discoveries that possess ‘markedly different characteristics from any found in nature,’ … are eligible for patent protection." _In re Roslin Institute (Edinburgh),_ 750 F.3d 1333, 1336, 110 USPQ2d 1668, 1671 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting _Chakrabarty,_ 447 U.S. at 310, 206 USPQ2d at 197). In _Roslin,_ the claimed invention was a live-born clone of a pre-existing, non-embryonic, donor mammal selected from cattle, sheep, pigs, and goats. An embodiment of the claimed invention was the famous Dolly the Sheep, which the court stated was "the first mammal ever cloned from an adult somatic cell." Despite acknowledging that the method used to create the claimed clones "constituted a breakthrough in scientific discovery", the court relied on _Chakrabarty_ in holding the claims ineligible because "Dolly herself is an exact genetic replica of another sheep and does not possess ‘markedly different characteristics from any [farm animals] found in nature.’" _Roslin,_ 750 F.3d at 1337, 110 USPQ2d at 1671.

See **[MPEP § 2106.04](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_139db_e0.html)** for a discussion of the judicial exceptions in general, **[MPEP § 2106.04(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13b6b_4c.html)**, subsection II, for a discussion of products of nature, and **[MPEP § 2106.04(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13bc1_b1.html)** for a discussion of the markedly different characteristics analysis that examiners should use to determine whether a nature-based product such as living subject matter is eligible for patent protection.

## III.    **HUMAN ORGANISMS ARE NONSTATUTORY SUBJECT MATTER**

Congress has excluded claims directed to or encompassing a human organism from patentability. The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA), Public Law 112-29, **[sec. 33(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//aiasec33limitonissuance.html)**, 125 Stat. 284, states:

> Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no patent may issue on a claim directed to or encompassing a human organism.

The legislative history of the AIA includes the following statement, which sheds light on the meaning of this provision:

> [T]he U.S. Patent Office has already issued patents on genes, stems cells, animals with human genes, and a host of non-biologic products used by humans, but it has not issued patents on claims directed to human organisms, including human embryos and fetuses. My amendment would not affect the former, but would simply affirm the latter.

157 Cong. Rec. E1177-04 (testimony of Representative Dave Weldon previously presented in connection with the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004, Public Law 108-199, 634, 118 Stat. 3, 101, and later resubmitted with regard to the AIA; see 149 Cong. Rec. E2417-01). Thus, **[section 33(a) of the AIA](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//aiasec33limitonissuance.html)**  codifies existing Office policy that human organisms are not patent-eligible subject matter.

If the broadest reasonable interpretation of the claimed invention as a whole encompasses a human organism, then a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  and **[AIA sec. 33(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//aiasec33limitonissuance.html)**  must be made indicating that the claimed invention is directed to a human organism and is therefore nonstatutory subject matter. Furthermore, the claimed invention must be examined with regard to all issues pertinent to patentability, and any applicable rejections under **[35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302383.html)**, **[103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302450.html)**, or **[112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824.html)**  must also be made.

# 2106    Patent Subject Matter Eligibility [R-10.2019]

## I.    **TWO CRITERIA FOR SUBJECT MATTER ELIGIBILITY**

First, the claimed invention must be to one of the four statutory categories. **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  defines the four categories of invention that Congress deemed to be the appropriate subject matter of a patent: processes, machines, manufactures and compositions of matter. The latter three categories define "things" or "products" while the first category defines "actions" (i.e., inventions that consist of a series of steps or acts to be performed). See **[35 U.S.C. 100(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302338313.html##d0e302350)**  ("The term ‘process’ means process, art, or method, and includes a new use of a known process, machine, manufacture, composition of matter, or material."). See **[MPEP § 2106.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_139b2_397.html)** for detailed information on the four categories.

Second, the claimed invention also must qualify as patent-eligible subject matter, i.e., the claim must not be directed to a judicial exception unless the claim as a whole includes additional limitations amounting to significantly more than the exception. The judicial exceptions (also called "judicially recognized exceptions" or simply "exceptions") are subject matter that the courts have found to be outside of, or exceptions to, the four statutory categories of invention, and are limited to abstract ideas, laws of nature and natural phenomena (including products of nature). _Alice Corp. Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank Int'l,_ 573 U.S. 208, 216, 110 USPQ2d 1976, 1980 (2014) (citing _Ass'n for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc.,_ 569 U.S. 576, 589, 106 USPQ2d 1972, 1979 (2013). See **[MPEP § 2106.04](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_139db_e0.html)** for detailed information on the judicial exceptions.

Because abstract ideas, laws of nature, and natural phenomenon "are the basic tools of scientific and technological work", the Supreme Court has expressed concern that monopolizing these tools by granting patent rights may impede innovation rather than promote it. See _Alice Corp.,_ 573 U.S. at 216, 110 USPQ2d at 1980; _Mayo Collaborative Servs. v. Prometheus Labs., Inc.,_ 566 U.S. 66, 71, 101 USPQ2d 1961, 1965 (2012). However, the Court has also emphasized that an invention is not considered to be ineligible for patenting simply because it involves a judicial exception. _Alice Corp.,_ 573 U.S. at 217, 110 USPQ2d at 1980-81 (citing _Diamond v. Diehr,_ 450 U.S. 175, 187, 209 USPQ 1, 8 (1981)). See also _Thales Visionix Inc. v. United States,_ 850 F.3d. 1343, 1349, 121 USPQ2d 1898, 1902 (Fed. Cir. 2017) ("That a mathematical equation is required to complete the claimed method and system does not doom the claims to abstraction."). Accordingly, the Court has said that integration of an abstract idea, law of nature or natural phenomenon into a practical application may be eligible for patent protection. See, _e.g., Alice,_ 573 U.S. at 217, 110 USPQ2d at 1981 (explaining that "in applying the **[§101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  exception, we must distinguish between patents that claim the ‘buildin[g] block[s]’ of human ingenuity and those that integrate the building blocks into something more" (quoting _Mayo,_ 566 U.S. at 89, 110 USPQ2d at 1971) and stating that _Mayo_ "set forth a framework for distinguishing patents that claim laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas from those that claim patent-eligible applications of those concepts"); _Mayo,_ 566 U.S. at 80, 84, 101 USPQ2d at 1969, 1971 (noting that the Court in _Diamond v. Diehr_ found "the overall process patent eligible because of the way the additional steps of the process integrated the equation into the process as a whole," but the Court in _Gottschalk v. Benson_ "held that simply implementing a mathematical principle on a physical machine, namely a computer, was not a patentable application of that principle"); _Bilski v. Kappos,_ 561 U.S. 593, 611, 95 USPQ2d 1001, 1010 (2010) ("_Diehr_ explained that while an abstract idea, law of nature, or mathematical formula could not be patented, ‘an application of a law of nature or mathematical formula to a known structure or process may well be deserving of patent protection.’" (quoting _Diamond v. Diehr,_ 450 U.S. 175, 187, 209 USPQ 1, 8 (1981)) (emphasis in original)); _Diehr,_ 450 U.S. at 187, 192 n.14, 209 USPQ at 10 n.14 (explaining that the process in _Parker v. Flook_ was ineligible not because it contained a mathematical formula, but because it did not provide an application of the formula). See _Diamond v. Diehr,_ 450 U.S. 175, 209 USPQ 1 (1981); _Gottschalk v. Benson,_ 409 U.S. 63, 175 USPQ 673 (1972); _Parker v. Flook,_ 437 U.S. 584, 198 USPQ 193 (1978).

The Supreme Court in _Mayo_ laid out a framework for determining whether an applicant is seeking to patent a judicial exception itself, or a patent-eligible application of the judicial exception. See _Alice Corp.,_ 573 U.S. at 217-18, 110 USPQ2d at 1981 (citing _Mayo_, 566 U.S. 66, 101 USPQ2d 1961). This framework, which is referred to as the _Mayo_ test or the _Alice/Mayo_ test, is discussed in further detail in subsection III, below. The first part of the _Mayo_ test is to determine whether the claims are directed to an abstract idea, a law of nature or a natural phenomenon (i.e., a judicial exception). _Id._ If the claims are directed to a judicial exception, the second part of the _Mayo_ test is to determine whether the claim recites additional elements that amount to significantly more than the judicial exception. _Id._ citing _Mayo,_ 566 U.S. at 72-73, 101 USPQ2d at 1966). The Supreme Court has described the second part of the test as the "search for an 'inventive concept'". _Alice Corp.,_ 573 U.S. at 217-18, 110 USPQ2d at 1981 (citing _Mayo_, 566 U.S. at 72-73, 101 USPQ2d at 1966).

The _Alice/Mayo_ two-part test is the only test that should be used to evaluate the eligibility of claims under examination. While the machine-or-transformation test is an important clue to eligibility, it should not be used as a separate test for eligibility. Instead it should be considered as part of the "integration" determination or "significantly more" determination articulated in the _Alice/Mayo_ test. _Bilski v. Kappos,_ 561 U.S. 593, 605, 95 USPQ2d 1001, 1007 (2010). See **[MPEP § 2106.04(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d2e7df_235a2_338.html)** for more information about evaluating whether a claim reciting a judicial exception is integrated into a practical application and **[MPEP § 2106.05(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13ccf_18c.html)** and **[MPEP § 2106.05(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13cfb_2e.html)** for more information about how the machine-or-transformation test fits into the _Alice/Mayo_ two-part framework. Likewise, eligibility should not be evaluated based on whether the claim recites a "useful, concrete, and tangible result," _State Street Bank_, 149 F.3d 1368, 1374, 47 USPQ2d 1596, 1602 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (quoting _In re Alappat,_ 33 F.3d 1526, 1544, 31 USPQ2d 1545, 1557 (Fed. Cir. 1994)), as this test has been superseded. _In re Bilski,_ 545 F.3d 943, 959-60, 88 USPQ2d 1385, 1394-95 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (_en banc_), aff'd by _Bilski v. Kappos,_ 561 U.S. 593, 95 USPQ2d 1001 (2010). See also _TLI Communications LLC v. AV Automotive LLC,_ 823 F.3d 607, 613, 118 USPQ2d 1744, 1748 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("It is well-settled that mere recitation of concrete, tangible components is insufficient to confer patent eligibility to an otherwise abstract idea"). The programmed computer or "special purpose computer" test of _In re Alappat_, 33 F.3d 1526, 31 USPQ2d 1545 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (_i.e._, the rationale that an otherwise ineligible algorithm or software could be made patent-eligible by merely adding a generic computer to the claim for the "special purpose" of executing the algorithm or software) was also superseded by the Supreme Court’s _Bilski_ and _Alice Corp._ decisions. _Eon Corp. IP Holdings LLC v. AT&T Mobility LLC,_ 785 F.3d 616, 623, 114 USPQ2d 1711, 1715 (Fed. Cir. 2015) ("[W]e note that _Alappat_ has been superseded by _Bilski,_ 561 U.S. at 605–06, and _Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank Int’l,_ 573 U.S. 208, 110 USPQ2d 1976 (2014)"); _Intellectual Ventures I LLC v. Capital One Bank (USA), N.A.,_ 792 F.3d 1363, 1366, 115 USPQ2d 1636, 1639 (Fed. Cir. 2015) ("An abstract idea does not become nonabstract by limiting the invention to a particular field of use or technological environment, such as the Internet [or] a computer"). Lastly, eligibility should not be evaluated based on whether the claimed invention has utility, because "[u]tility is not the test for patent-eligible subject matter." _Genetic Techs. Ltd. v. Merial LLC,_ 818 F.3d 1369, 1380, 118 USPQ2d 1541, 1548 (Fed. Cir. 2016).

Examiners are reminded that **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  is not the sole tool for determining patentability; **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824.html)**  , **[35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302383.html)**, and **[35 U.S.C. 103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302450.html)**  will provide additional tools for ensuring that the claim meets the conditions for patentability. As the Supreme Court made clear in _Bilski,_ 561 U.S. at 602, 95 USPQ2d at 1006:

> The **[§ 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  patent-eligibility inquiry is only a threshold test. Even if an invention qualifies as a process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, in order to receive the Patent Act’s protection the claimed invention must also satisfy ‘‘the conditions and requirements of this title.’’ **[§ 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**. Those requirements include that the invention be novel, see **[§ 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302383.html)**, nonobvious, see **[§ 103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302450.html)**, and fully and particularly described, see **[§ 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824.html)**.

## II.    **ESTABLISH BROADEST REASONABLE INTERPRETATION OF CLAIM AS A WHOLE**

It is essential that the broadest reasonable interpretation (BRI) of the claim be established prior to examining a claim for eligibility. The BRI sets the boundaries of the coverage sought by the claim and will influence whether the claim seeks to cover subject matter that is beyond the four statutory categories or encompasses subject matter that falls within the exceptions. See _MyMail, Ltd. v. ooVoo, LLC,_ 934 F.3d 1373, 1379, 2019 USPQ2d 305789 (Fed. Cir. 2019) ("Determining patent eligibility requires a full understanding of the basic character of the claimed subject matter"), citing _Bancorp Servs., LLC v. Sun Life Assurance Co. of Can. (U.S.),_ 687 F.3d 1266, 1273-74, 103 USPQ2d 1425, 1430 (Fed. Cir. 2012); _In re Bilski,_ 545 F.3d 943, 951, 88 USPQ2d 1385, 1388 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (_en banc_ ), aff'd by _Bilski v. Kappos,_ 561 U.S. 593, 95 USPQ2d 1001 (2010) ("claim construction … is an important first step in a **[§ 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  analysis"). Evaluating eligibility based on the BRI also ensures that patent eligibility under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  does not depend simply on the draftsman’s art. _Alice,_ 573 U.S. 208, 224, 110 USPQ2d at 1984, 1985 (citing _Parker v. Flook,_ 437 U.S. 584, 593, 198 USPQ 193, 198 (1978) and _Mayo,_ 566 U.S. at 72, 101 USPQ2d at 1966). See **[MPEP § 2111](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e200352.html)** for more information about determining the BRI.

Claim interpretation affects the evaluation of both criteria for eligibility. For example, in _Mentor Graphics v. EVE-USA, Inc.,_ 851 F.3d 1275, 112 USPQ2d 1120 (Fed. Cir. 2017), claim interpretation was crucial to the court’s determination that claims to a "machine-readable medium" were not to a statutory category. In _Mentor Graphics,_ the court interpreted the claims in light of the specification, which expressly defined the medium as encompassing "any data storage device" including random-access memory and carrier waves. Although random-access memory and magnetic tape are statutory media, carrier waves are not because they are signals similar to the transitory, propagating signals held to be non-statutory in _Nuijten_. 851 F.3d at 1294, 112 USPQ2d at 1133 (citing _In re Nuijten,_ 500 F.3d 1346, 84 USPQ2d 1495 (Fed. Cir. 2007)). Accordingly, because the BRI of the claims covered both subject matter that falls within a statutory category (the random-access memory), as well as subject matter that does not (the carrier waves), the claims as a whole were not to a statutory category and thus failed the first criterion for eligibility.

With regard to the second criterion for eligibility, the _Alice/Mayo_ test, claim interpretation can affect the first part of the test (whether the claims are directed to a judicial exception). For example, the patentee in _Synopsys_ argued that the claimed methods of logic circuit design were intended to be used in conjunction with computer-based design tools, and were thus not mental processes. _Synopsys, Inc. v. Mentor Graphics Corp.,_ 839 F.3d 1138, 1147-49, 120 USPQ2d 1473, 1480-81 (Fed. Cir. 2016). The court disagreed, because it interpreted the claims as encompassing nothing other than pure mental steps (and thus falling within an abstract idea grouping) because the claims did not include any limitations requiring computer implementation. In contrast, the patentee in _Enfish_ argued that its claimed self-referential table for a computer database was an improvement in an existing technology and thus not directed to an abstract idea. _Enfish, LLC v. Microsoft Corp.,_ 822 F.3d 1327, 1336-37, 118 USPQ2d 1684, 1689-90 (Fed. Cir. 2016). The court agreed with the patentee, based on its interpretation of the claimed "means for configuring" under **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae7b_ec)**  as requiring a four-step algorithm that achieved the improvements, as opposed to merely any form of storing tabular data. See also _McRO, Inc. v. Bandai Namco Games America, Inc._ 837 F.3d 1299, 1314, 120 USPQ2d 1091, 1102 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (the claim’s construction incorporated rules of a particular type that improved an existing technological process). Claim interpretation can also affect the second part of the _Alice/Mayo_ test (whether the claim recites additional elements that amount to significantly more than the judicial exception). For example, in _Amdocs (Israel) Ltd. v. Openet Telecom, Inc.,_ where the court relied on the construction of the term "enhance" (to require application of a number of field enhancements in a distributed fashion) to determine that the claim entails an unconventional technical solution to a technological problem. 841 F.3d 1288, 1300-01, 120 USPQ2d 1527, 1537 (Fed. Cir. 2016).

## III.    **SUMMARY OF ANALYSIS AND FLOWCHART**

Examiners should determine whether a claim satisfies the criteria for subject matter eligibility by evaluating the claim in accordance with the following flowchart. The flowchart illustrates the steps of the subject matter eligibility analysis for products and processes that are to be used during examination for evaluating whether a claim is drawn to patent-eligible subject matter. It is recognized that under the controlling legal precedent there may be variations in the precise contours of the analysis for subject matter eligibility that will still achieve the same end result. The analysis set forth herein promotes examination efficiency and consistency across all technologies.

As shown in the flowchart, Step 1 relates to the statutory categories and ensures that the first criterion is met by confirming that the claim falls within one of the four statutory categories of invention. See **[MPEP § 2106.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_139b2_397.html)** for more information on Step 1. Step 2, which is the Supreme Court’s _Alice/Mayo_ test, is a two-part test to identify claims that are directed to a judicial exception (Step 2A) and to then evaluate if additional elements of the claim provide an inventive concept (Step 2B) (also called "significantly more" than the recited judicial exception). See **[MPEP § 2106.04](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_139db_e0.html)** for more information on Step 2A and **[MPEP § 2106.05](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13c11_1cb.html)** for more information on Step 2B.

The flowchart also shows three pathways (A, B, and C) to eligibility:

- Pathway A: Claims taken as a whole that fall within a statutory category (Step 1: YES) and, which may or may not recite a judicial exception, but whose eligibility is self-evident can be found eligible at Pathway A using a streamlined analysis. See **[MPEP § 2106.06](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13e6a_88.html)** for more information on this pathway and on self-evident eligibility.
- Pathway B: Claims taken as a whole that fall within a statutory category (Step 1: YES) and are not directed to a judicial exception (Step 2A: NO) are eligible at Pathway B. These claims do not need to go to Step 2B. See **[MPEP § 2106.04](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_139db_e0.html)** for more information about this pathway and Step 2A.
- Pathway C: Claims taken as a whole that fall within a statutory category (Step 1: YES), are directed to a judicial exception (Step 2A: YES), and recite additional elements either individually or in an ordered combination that amount to significantly more than the judicial exception (Step 2B: YES) are eligible at Pathway C. See **[MPEP § 2106.05](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13c11_1cb.html)** for more information about this pathway and Step 2B.

Claims that could have been found eligible at Pathway A (streamlined analysis), but are subjected to further analysis at Steps 2A or Step 2B, will ultimately be found eligible at Pathways B or C. Thus, if the examiner is uncertain about whether a streamlined analysis is appropriate, the examiner is encouraged to conduct a full eligibility analysis. However, if the claim is not found eligible at any of Pathways A, B or C, the claim is patent ineligible and should be rejected under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**.

Regardless of whether a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  is made, a complete examination should be made for every claim under each of the other patentability requirements: **[35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//al_d1fbe1_234ed_52.html)**, **[103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//al_d1fbe1_19797_b0.html)**, **[112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824912.html)**, and **[101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  (utility, inventorship and double patenting) and non-statutory double patenting. **[MPEP § 2103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d1b13f_18960_3c9.html)**.

# 2106.03    Eligibility Step 1: The Four Categories of Statutory Subject Matter [R-07.2022]

## I.    **THE FOUR CATEGORIES**

**[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  enumerates four categories of subject matter that Congress deemed to be appropriate subject matter for a patent: processes, machines, manufactures and compositions of matter. As explained by the courts, these "four categories together describe the exclusive reach of patentable subject matter. If a claim covers material not found in any of the four statutory categories, that claim falls outside the plainly expressed scope of **[§ 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  even if the subject matter is otherwise new and useful." _In re Nuijten,_ 500 F.3d 1346, 1354, 84 USPQ2d 1495, 1500 (Fed. Cir. 2007).

A process defines "actions", _i.e.,_ an invention that is claimed as an act or step, or a series of acts or steps. As explained by the Supreme Court, a "process" is "a mode of treatment of certain materials to produce a given result. It is an _act, or a series of acts,_ performed upon the subject-matter to be transformed and reduced to a different state or thing." _Gottschalk v. Benson,_ 409 U.S. 63, 70, 175 USPQ 673, 676 (1972) (italics added) (quoting _Cochrane v. Deener,_ 94 U.S. 780, 788, 24 L. Ed. 139, 141 (1876)). See also _Nuijten,_ 500 F.3d at 1355, 84 USPQ2d at 1501 ("The Supreme Court and this court have consistently interpreted the statutory term ‘process’ to require action"); _NTP, Inc. v. Research in Motion, Ltd.,_ 418 F.3d 1282, 1316, 75 USPQ2d 1763, 1791 (Fed. Cir. 2005) ("[A] process is a series of acts.") (quoting _Minton v. Natl. Ass’n. of Securities Dealers,_ 336 F.3d 1373, 1378, 67 USPQ2d 1614, 1681 (Fed. Cir. 2003)). As defined in **[35 U.S.C. 100(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302338313.html##d0e302350)**, the term "process" is synonymous with "method."

The other three categories (machines, manufactures and compositions of matter) define the types of physical or tangible "things" or "products" that Congress deemed appropriate to patent. _Digitech Image Techs. v. Electronics for Imaging,_ 758 F.3d 1344, 1348, 111 USPQ2d 1717, 1719 (Fed. Cir. 2014) ("For all categories except process claims, the eligible subject matter must exist in some physical or tangible form."). Thus, when determining whether a claimed invention falls within one of these three categories, examiners should verify that the invention is to at least one of the following categories **and** is claimed in a physical or tangible form.

- • A machine is a "concrete thing, consisting of parts, or of certain devices and combination of devices." _Digitech,_ 758 F.3d at 1348-49, 111 USPQ2d at 1719 (quoting _Burr v. Duryee,_ 68 U.S. 531, 570, 17 L. Ed. 650, 657 (1863)). This category "includes every mechanical device or combination of mechanical powers and devices to perform some function and produce a certain effect or result." _Nuijten,_ 500 F.3d at 1355, 84 USPQ2d at 1501 (quoting _Corning v. Burden,_ 56 U.S. 252, 267, 14 L. Ed. 683, 690 (1854)).
- • A manufacture is "a tangible article that is given a new form, quality, property, or combination through man-made or artificial means." _Digitech,_ 758 F.3d at 1349, 111 USPQ2d at 1719-20 (citing _Diamond v. Chakrabarty,_ 447 U.S. 303, 308, 206 USPQ 193, 197 (1980)). As the courts have explained, manufactures are articles that result from the process of manufacturing, _i.e.,_ they were produced "from raw or prepared materials by giving to these materials new forms, qualities, properties, or combinations, whether by hand-labor or by machinery." _Samsung Electronics Co. v. Apple Inc.,_ 137 S. Ct. 429, 120 USPQ2d 1749, 1752-3 (2016) (quoting _Diamond v. Chakrabarty,_ 447 U. S. 303, 308, 206 USPQ 193, 196-97 (1980)); _Nuijten,_ 500 F.3d at 1356-57, 84 USPQ2d at 1502. Manufactures also include "the parts of a machine considered separately from the machine itself." _Samsung Electronics,_ 137 S. Ct. at 435, 120 USPQ2d at 1753 (quoting 1 W. Robinson, The Law of Patents for Useful Inventions §183, p. 270 (1890)).
- • A composition of matter is a "combination of two or more substances and includes all composite articles." _Digitech,_ 758 F.3d at 1348-49, 111 USPQ2d at 1719 (citation omitted). This category includes all compositions of two or more substances and all composite articles, "'whether they be the results of chemical union or of mechanical mixture, or whether they be gases, fluids, powders or solids.'" _Chakrabarty,_ 447 U.S. at 308, 206 USPQ at 197 (quoting _Shell Dev. Co. v. Watson,_ 149 F. Supp. 279, 280 (D.D.C. 1957); _id._ at 310 holding genetically modified microorganism to be a manufacture or composition of matter).

It is not necessary to identify a single category into which a claim falls, so long as it is clear that the claim falls into at least one category. For example, because a microprocessor is generally understood to be a manufacture, a product claim to the microprocessor or a system comprising the microprocessor satisfies Step 1 regardless of whether the claim falls within any other statutory category (such as a machine). It is also not necessary to identify a "correct" category into which the claim falls, because although in many instances it is clear within which category a claimed invention falls, a claim may satisfy the requirements of more than one category. For example, a bicycle satisfies both the machine and manufacture categories, because it is a tangible product that is concrete and consists of parts such as a frame and wheels (thus satisfying the machine category), and it is an article that was produced from raw materials such as aluminum ore and liquid rubber by giving them a new form (thus satisfying the manufacture category). Similarly, a genetically modified bacterium satisfies both the composition of matter and manufacture categories, because it is a tangible product that is a combination of two or more substances such as proteins, carbohydrates and other chemicals (thus satisfying the composition of matter category), and it is an article that was genetically modified by humans to have new properties such as the ability to digest multiple types of hydrocarbons (thus satisfying the manufacture category).

Non-limiting examples of claims that are not directed to any of the statutory categories include:

- • Products that do not have a physical or tangible form, such as information (often referred to as "data per se") or a computer program per se (often referred to as "software per se") when claimed as a product without any structural recitations;
- • Transitory forms of signal transmission (often referred to as "signals per se"), such as a propagating electrical or electromagnetic signal or carrier wave; and
- • Subject matter that the statute expressly prohibits from being patented, such as humans per se, which are excluded under The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA), Public Law 112-29, sec. 33, 125 Stat. 284 (September 16, 2011).

As the courts' definitions of machines, manufactures and compositions of matter indicate, a product must have a physical or tangible form in order to fall within one of these statutory categories. _Digitech,_ 758 F.3d at 1348, 111 USPQ2d at 1719. Thus, the Federal Circuit has held that a product claim to an intangible collection of information, even if created by human effort, does not fall within any statutory category. _Digitech,_ 758 F.3d at 1350, 111 USPQ2d at 1720 (claimed "device profile" comprising two sets of data did not meet any of the categories because it was neither a process nor a tangible product). Similarly, software expressed as code or a set of instructions detached from any medium is an idea without physical embodiment. See _Microsoft Corp. v. AT&T Corp.,_ 550 U.S. 437, 449, 82 USPQ2d 1400, 1407 (2007); see also _Benson,_ 409 U.S. 67, 175 USPQ2d 675 (An "idea" is not patent eligible). Thus, a product claim to a software program that does not also contain at least one structural limitation (such as a "means plus function" limitation) has no physical or tangible form, and thus does not fall within any statutory category. Another example of an intangible product that does not fall within a statutory category is a paradigm or business model for a marketing company. _In re Ferguson,_ 558 F.3d 1359, 1364, 90 USPQ2d 1035, 1039-40 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

Even when a product has a physical or tangible form, it may not fall within a statutory category. For instance, a transitory signal, while physical and real, does not possess concrete structure that would qualify as a device or part under the definition of a machine, is not a tangible article or commodity under the definition of a manufacture (even though it is man-made and physical in that it exists in the real world and has tangible causes and effects), and is not composed of matter such that it would qualify as a composition of matter. _Nuijten,_ 500 F.3d at 1356-1357, 84 USPQ2d at 1501-03. As such, a transitory, propagating signal does not fall within any statutory category. _Mentor Graphics Corp. v. EVE-USA, Inc.,_ 851 F.3d 1275, 1294, 112 USPQ2d 1120, 1133 (Fed. Cir. 2017); _Nuijten,_ 500 F.3d at 1356-1357, 84 USPQ2d at 1501-03.

## II.    **ELIGIBILITY STEP 1: WHETHER A CLAIM IS TO A STATUTORY CATEGORY**

As described in **[MPEP § 2106](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e197244.html)**, subsection III, Step 1 of the eligibility analysis asks: Is the claim to a process, machine, manufacture or composition of matter? Like the other steps in the eligibility analysis, evaluation of this step should be made after determining what the inventor has invented by reviewing the entire application disclosure and construing the claims in accordance with their broadest reasonable interpretation (BRI). See **[MPEP § 2106](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e197244.html)**, subsection II, for more information about the importance of understanding what has been invented, and **[MPEP § 2111](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e200352.html)** for more information about the BRI.

In the context of the flowchart in **[MPEP § 2106](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e197244.html)**, subsection III, Step 1 determines whether:

- • The claim as a whole does not fall within any statutory category (Step 1: NO) and thus is non-statutory, warranting a rejection for failure to claim statutory subject matter; or
- • The claim as a whole falls within one or more statutory categories (Step 1: YES), and thus must be further analyzed to determine whether it qualifies as eligible at Pathway A or requires further analysis at Step 2A to determine if the claim is directed to a judicial exception.

A claim whose BRI covers both statutory and non-statutory embodiments embraces subject matter that is not eligible for patent protection and therefore is directed to non-statutory subject matter. Such claims fail the first step (Step 1: NO) and should be rejected under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**, for at least this reason. In such a case, it is a best practice for the examiner to point out the BRI and recommend an amendment, if possible, that would narrow the claim to those embodiments that fall within a statutory category.

For example, the BRI of machine readable media can encompass non-statutory transitory forms of signal transmission, such as a propagating electrical or electromagnetic signal per se. See _In re Nuijten,_ 500 F.3d 1346, 84 USPQ2d 1495 (Fed. Cir. 2007). When the BRI encompasses transitory forms of signal transmission, a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  as failing to claim statutory subject matter would be appropriate. Thus, a claim to a computer readable medium that can be a compact disc or a carrier wave covers a non-statutory embodiment and therefore should be rejected under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  as being directed to non-statutory subject matter. See, _e.g., Mentor Graphics v. EVE-USA, Inc.,_ 851 F.3d at 1294-95, 112 USPQ2d at 1134 (claims to a "machine-readable medium" were non-statutory, because their scope encompassed both statutory random-access memory and non-statutory carrier waves).

If a claim is clearly not within one of the four categories (Step 1: NO), then a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  must be made indicating that the claim is directed to non-statutory subject matter. Form paragraphs **[7.05](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//fp7.05.html)** and **[7.05.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//fp7.05.01.html)** should be used; see **[MPEP § 2106.07(a)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d2c183_20b8d_1b9.html)**. However, as shown in the flowchart in **[MPEP § 2106](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e197244.html)** subsection III, when a claim fails under Step 1 (Step 1: NO), but it appears from applicant’s disclosure that the claim could be amended to fall within a statutory category (Step 1: YES), the analysis should proceed to determine whether such an amended claim would qualify as eligible at Pathway A, B or C. In such a case, it is a best practice for the examiner to recommend an amendment, if possible, that would resolve eligibility of the claim.

# 2106.04    Eligibility Step 2A: Whether a Claim is Directed to a Judicial Exception [R-07.2022]

## I.    **JUDICIAL EXCEPTIONS**

Determining that a claim falls within one of the four enumerated categories of patentable subject matter recited in **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  (i.e., process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter) in Step 1 does not end the eligibility analysis, because claims directed to nothing more than abstract ideas (such as a mathematical formula or equation), natural phenomena, and laws of nature are not eligible for patent protection. _Diamond v. Diehr,_ 450 U.S. 175, 185, 209 USPQ 1, 7 (1981). _Alice Corp. Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank Int'l,_ 573 U.S. 208, 216, 110 USPQ2d 1976, 1980 (2014) (citing _Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc.,_ 569 U.S. 576, 589, 106 USPQ2d 1972, 1979 (2013)); _Diamond v. Chakrabarty,_ 447 U.S. 303, 309, 206 USPQ 193, 197 (1980); _Parker v. Flook,_ 437 U.S. 584, 589, 198 USPQ 193, 197 (1978); _Gottschalk v. Benson,_ 409 U.S. 63, 67-68, 175 USPQ 673, 675 (1972). See also _Bilski v. Kappos,_ 561 U.S. 593, 601, 95 USPQ2d 1001, 1005-06 (2010) ("The Court’s precedents provide three specific exceptions to **[§ 101's](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  broad patent-eligibility principles: ‘laws of nature, physical phenomena, and abstract ideas’") (quoting _Chakrabarty,_ 447 U.S. at 309, 206 USPQ at 197 (1980)).

In addition to the terms "laws of nature," "natural phenomena," and "abstract ideas," judicially recognized exceptions have been described using various other terms, including "physical phenomena," "products of nature," "scientific principles," "systems that depend on human intelligence alone," "disembodied concepts," "mental processes," and "disembodied mathematical algorithms and formulas." It should be noted that there are no bright lines between the types of exceptions, and that many of the concepts identified by the courts as exceptions can fall under several exceptions. For example, mathematical formulas are considered to be a judicial exception as they express a scientific truth, but have been labelled by the courts as both abstract ideas and laws of nature. Likewise, "products of nature" are considered to be an exception because they tie up the use of naturally occurring things, but have been labelled as both laws of nature and natural phenomena. Thus, it is sufficient for this analysis for the examiner to identify that the claimed concept (the specific claim limitation(s) that the examiner believes may recite an exception) aligns with at least one judicial exception.

The Supreme Court has explained that the judicial exceptions reflect the Court’s view that abstract ideas, laws of nature, and natural phenomena are "the basic tools of scientific and technological work", and are thus excluded from patentability because "monopolization of those tools through the grant of a patent might tend to impede innovation more than it would tend to promote it." _Alice Corp.,_ 573 U.S. at 216, 110 USPQ2d at 1980 (quoting _Myriad,_ 569 U.S. at 589, 106 USPQ2d at 1978 and _Mayo Collaborative Servs. v. Prometheus Labs. Inc.,_ 566 U.S. 66, 71, 101 USPQ2d 1961, 1965 (2012)). The Supreme Court’s concern that drives this "exclusionary principle" is pre-emption. _Alice Corp.,_ 573 U.S. at 216, 110 USPQ2d at 1980. The Court has held that a claim may not preempt abstract ideas, laws of nature, or natural phenomena, even if the judicial exception is narrow (e.g., a particular mathematical formula such as the Arrhenius equation). See, _e.g., Mayo,_ 566 U.S. at 79-80, 86-87, 101 USPQ2d at 1968-69, 1971 (claims directed to "narrow laws that may have limited applications" held ineligible); _Flook,_ 437 U.S. at 589-90, 198 USPQ at 197 (claims that did not "wholly preempt the mathematical formula" held ineligible). This is because such a patent would "in practical effect [] be a patent on the [abstract idea, law of nature or natural phenomenon] itself." _Benson,_ 409 U.S. at 71- 72, 175 USPQ at 676. The concern over preemption was expressed as early as 1852. See _Le Roy v. Tatham,_ 55 U.S. (14 How.) 156, 175 (1852) ("A principle, in the abstract, is a fundamental truth; an original cause; a motive; these cannot be patented, as no one can claim in either of them an exclusive right.").

While preemption is the concern underlying the judicial exceptions, it is not a standalone test for determining eligibility. _Rapid Litig. Mgmt. v. CellzDirect, Inc.,_ 827 F.3d 1042, 1052, 119 USPQ2d 1370, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2016). Instead, questions of preemption are inherent in and resolved by the two-part framework from _Alice Corp. and Mayo_ (the _Alice/Mayo_ test referred to by the Office as Steps 2A and 2B). _Synopsys, Inc. v. Mentor Graphics Corp.,_ 839 F.3d 1138, 1150, 120 USPQ2d 1473, 1483 (Fed. Cir. 2016); _Ariosa Diagnostics, Inc. v. Sequenom, Inc.,_ 788 F.3d 1371, 1379, 115 USPQ2d 1152, 1158 (Fed. Cir. 2015). It is necessary to evaluate eligibility using the _Alice/Mayo_ test, because while a preemptive claim may be ineligible, the absence of complete preemption does not demonstrate that a claim is eligible. _Diamond v. Diehr,_ 450 U.S. 175, 191-92 n.14, 209 USPQ 1, 10-11 n.14 (1981) ("We rejected in _Flook_ the argument that because all possible uses of the mathematical formula were not pre-empted, the claim should be eligible for patent protection"). See also _Synopsys v. Mentor Graphics,_ 839 F.3d at 1150, 120 USPQ2d at 1483; _FairWarning IP, LLC v. Iatric Sys., Inc.,_ 839 F.3d 1089, 1098, 120 USPQ2d 1293, 1299 (Fed. Cir. 2016); _Intellectual Ventures I LLC v. Symantec Corp.,_ 838 F.3d 1307, 1320-21, 120 USPQ2d 1353, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2016); _Sequenom,_ 788 F.3d at 1379, 115 USPQ2d at 1158. Several Federal Circuit decisions, however, have noted the absence of preemption when finding claims eligible under the _Alice/Mayo_ test. _McRO, Inc. v. Bandai Namco Games Am. Inc.,_ 837 F.3d 1299, 1315, 120 USPQ2d 1091, 1102-03 (Fed. Cir. 2016); _Rapid Litig. Mgmt. v. CellzDirect, Inc.,_ 827 F.3d 1042, 1052, 119 USPQ2d 1370, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2016); _BASCOM Global Internet v. AT&T Mobility, LLC,_ 827 F.3d 1341, 1350-52, 119 USPQ2d 1236, 1243-44 (Fed. Cir. 2016).

The Supreme Court’s decisions make it clear that judicial exceptions need not be old or long-prevalent, and that even newly discovered or novel judicial exceptions are still exceptions. For example, the mathematical formula in _Flook,_ the laws of nature in _Mayo,_ and the isolated DNA in _Myriad_ were all novel or newly discovered, but nonetheless were considered by the Supreme Court to be judicial exceptions because they were "‘basic tools of scientific and technological work’ that lie beyond the domain of patent protection." _Myriad,_ 569 U.S. 576, 589, 106 USPQ2d at 1976, 1978 (noting that _Myriad_ discovered the BRCA1 and BRCA1 genes and quoting _Mayo,_ 566 U.S. 71, 101 USPQ2d at 1965); _Flook,_ 437 U.S. at 591-92, 198 USPQ2d at 198 ("the novelty of the mathematical algorithm is not a determining factor at all"); _Mayo,_ 566 U.S. 73-74, 78, 101 USPQ2d 1966, 1968 (noting that the claims embody the researcher's discoveries of laws of nature). The Supreme Court’s cited rationale for considering even "just discovered" judicial exceptions as exceptions stems from the concern that "without this exception, there would be considerable danger that the grant of patents would ‘tie up’ the use of such tools and thereby ‘inhibit future innovation premised upon them.’" _Myriad,_ 569 U.S. at 589, 106 USPQ2d at 1978-79 (quoting _Mayo,_ 566 U.S. at 86, 101 USPQ2d at 1971). See also _Myriad,_ 569 U.S. at 591, 106 USPQ2d at 1979 ("Groundbreaking, innovative, or even brilliant discovery does not by itself satisfy the **[§101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  inquiry."). The Federal Circuit has also applied this principle, for example, when holding a concept of using advertising as an exchange or currency to be an abstract idea, despite the patentee’s arguments that the concept was "new". _Ultramercial, Inc. v. Hulu, LLC,_ 772 F.3d 709, 714-15, 112 USPQ2d 1750, 1753-54 (Fed. Cir. 2014). _Cf. Synopsys, Inc. v. Mentor Graphics Corp.,_ 839 F.3d 1138, 1151, 120 USPQ2d 1473, 1483 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("a **_new_** abstract idea is still an abstract idea") (emphasis in original).

For a detailed discussion of abstract ideas, see **[MPEP § 2106.04(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13a9e_2dc.html)**; for a detailed discussion of laws of nature, natural phenomena and products of nature, see **[MPEP § 2106.04(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13b6b_4c.html)**.

## II.    **ELIGIBILITY STEP 2A: WHETHER A CLAIM IS DIRECTED TO A JUDICIAL EXCEPTION**

As described in **[MPEP § 2106](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e197244.html)**, subsection III, Step 2A of the Office’s eligibility analysis is the first part of the _Alice/Mayo_ test, _i.e.,_ the Supreme Court’s "framework for distinguishing patents that claim laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas from those that claim patent-eligible applications of those concepts." _Alice Corp. Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank Int'l,_ 573 U.S. 208, 217-18, 110 USPQ2d 1976, 1981 (2014) (citing _Mayo,_ 566 U.S. at 77-78, 101 USPQ2d at 1967-68). Like the other steps in the eligibility analysis, evaluation of this step should be made after determining what the inventor has invented by reviewing the entire application disclosure and construing the claims in accordance with their broadest reasonable interpretation. See **[MPEP § 2106](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e197244.html)**, subsection II for more information about the importance of understanding what has been invented, and **[MPEP § 2111](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e200352.html)** for more information about the broadest reasonable interpretation.

Step 2A asks: Is the claim directed to a law of nature, a natural phenomenon (product of nature) or an abstract idea? In the context of the flowchart in **[MPEP § 2106](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e197244.html)**, subsection III, Step 2A determines whether:

- • The claim as a whole is not directed to a judicial exception (Step 2A: NO) and thus is eligible at Pathway B, thereby concluding the eligibility analysis; or
- • The claim as a whole is directed to a judicial exception (Step 2A: YES) and thus requires further analysis at Step 2B to determine if the claim as a whole amounts to significantly more than the exception itself.

## A.    **_Step 2A Is a Two-Prong Inquiry_**

Step 2A is a two-prong inquiry, in which examiners determine in Prong One whether a claim recites a judicial exception, and if so, then determine in Prong Two if the recited judicial exception is integrated into a practical application of that exception. Together, these prongs represent the first part of the _Alice/Mayo_ test, which determines whether a claim is directed to a judicial exception.

The flowchart below depicts the two-prong analysis that is performed in order to answer the Step 2A inquiry.

![Subject Matter Eligibility Flowchart](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/graphics/E9_R-01.2024/210604_step_2a.png "Subject Matter Eligibility Flowchart")

## 1.    **Prong One**

Prong One asks does the claim recite an abstract idea, law of nature, or natural phenomenon? In Prong One examiners evaluate whether the claim recites a judicial exception, i.e. whether a law of nature, natural phenomenon, or abstract idea is **set forth** or **described** in the claim. While the terms "set forth" and "described" are thus both equated with "recite", their different language is intended to indicate that there are two ways in which an exception can be recited in a claim. For instance, the claims in _Diehr,_ 450 U.S. at 178 n. 2, 179 n.5, 191-92, 209 USPQ at 4-5 (1981), clearly stated a mathematical equation in the repetitively calculating step, and the claims in _Mayo,_ 566 U.S. 66, 75-77, 101 USPQ2d 1961, 1967-68 (2012), clearly stated laws of nature in the wherein clause, such that the claims "set forth" an identifiable judicial exception. Alternatively, the claims in _Alice Corp.,_ 573 U.S. at 218, 110 USPQ2d at 1982, described the concept of intermediated settlement without ever explicitly using the words "intermediated" or "settlement."

The Supreme Court has held that Section 101 contains an implicit exception for ‘‘[l]aws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas,’’ which are ‘‘the basic tools of scientific and technological work.’’ _Alice Corp.,_ 573 U.S. at 216, 110 USPQ2d at 1980 (citing _Mayo,_ 566 US at 71, 101 USPQ2d at 1965). Yet, the Court has explained that ‘‘[a]t some level, all inventions embody, use, reflect, rest upon, or apply laws of nature, natural phenomena, or abstract ideas,’’ and has cautioned ‘‘to tread carefully in construing this exclusionary principle lest it swallow all of patent law.’’ _Id._ See also _Enfish, LLC v. Microsoft Corp.,_ 822 F.3d 1327, 1335, 118 USPQ2d 1684, 1688 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("The ‘directed to’ inquiry, therefore, cannot simply ask whether the claims involve a patent-ineligible concept, because essentially every routinely patent-eligible claim involving physical products and actions involves a law of nature and/or natural phenomenon"). Examiners should accordingly be careful to distinguish claims that **recite** an exception (which require further eligibility analysis) and claims that merely **involve** an exception (which are eligible and do not require further eligibility analysis).

An example of a claim that recites a judicial exception is "A machine comprising elements that operate in accordance with F=ma." This claim sets forth the principle that force equals mass times acceleration (F=ma) and therefore recites a law of nature exception. Because F=ma represents a mathematical formula, the claim could alternatively be considered as reciting an abstract idea. Because this claim recites a judicial exception, it requires further analysis in Prong Two in order to answer the Step 2A inquiry. An example of a claim that merely involves, or is based on, an exception is a claim to "A teeter-totter comprising an elongated member pivotably attached to a base member, having seats and handles attached at opposing sides of the elongated member." This claim is based on the concept of a lever pivoting on a fulcrum, which involves the natural principles of mechanical advantage and the law of the lever. However, this claim does not recite these natural principles and therefore is not directed to a judicial exception (Step 2A: NO). Thus, the claim is eligible at Pathway B without further analysis.

If the claim recites a judicial exception (_i.e.,_ an abstract idea enumerated in **[MPEP § 2106.04(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13a9e_2dc.html)**, a law of nature, or a natural phenomenon), the claim requires further analysis in Prong Two. If the claim does not recite a judicial exception (a law of nature, natural phenomenon, or abstract idea), then the claim cannot be directed to a judicial exception (Step 2A: NO), and thus the claim is eligible at Pathway B without further analysis.

For more information how to determine if a claim recites an abstract idea, see **[MPEP § 2106.04(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13a9e_2dc.html)**. For more information on how to determine if a claim recites a law of nature or natural phenomenon, see **[MPEP § 2106.04(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13b6b_4c.html)**. For more information on how to determine if a claim recites a product of nature, see **[MPEP § 2106.04(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13bc1_b1.html)**.

## 2.    **Prong Two**

Prong Two asks does the claim recite additional elements that integrate the judicial exception into a practical application? In Prong Two, examiners evaluate whether the claim as a whole integrates the exception into a practical application of that exception. If the additional elements in the claim integrate the recited exception into a practical application of the exception, then the claim is not directed to the judicial exception (Step 2A: NO) and thus is eligible at Pathway B. This concludes the eligibility analysis. If, however, the additional elements do not integrate the exception into a practical application, then the claim is directed to the recited judicial exception (Step 2A: YES), and requires further analysis under Step 2B (where it may still be eligible if it amounts to an ‘‘inventive concept’’). For more information on how to evaluate whether a judicial exception is integrated into a practical application, see **[MPEP § 2106.04(d)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d2e827_17196_6c.html)**.

The mere inclusion of a judicial exception such as a mathematical formula (which is one of the mathematical concepts identified as an abstract idea in **[MPEP § 2106.04(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13a9e_2dc.html)**) in a claim means that the claim "recites" a judicial exception under Step 2A Prong One. However, mere recitation of a judicial exception does not mean that the claim is "directed to" that judicial exception under Step 2A Prong Two. Instead, under Prong Two, a claim that recites a judicial exception is not directed to that judicial exception, if the claim as a whole integrates the recited judicial exception into a practical application of that exception. Prong Two thus distinguishes claims that are "directed to" the recited judicial exception from claims that are not "directed to" the recited judicial exception.

Because a judicial exception is not eligible subject matter, _Bilski,_ 561 U.S. at 601, 95 USPQ2d at 1005-06 (quoting _Chakrabarty,_ 447 U.S. at 309, 206 USPQ at 197 (1980)), if there are no additional claim elements besides the judicial exception, or if the additional claim elements merely recite another judicial exception, that is insufficient to integrate the judicial exception into a practical application. See, _e.g., RecogniCorp, LLC v. Nintendo Co.,_ 855 F.3d 1322, 1327, 122 USPQ2d 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2017) ("Adding one abstract idea (math) to another abstract idea (encoding and decoding) does not render the claim non-abstract"); _Genetic Techs. Ltd. v. Merial LLC,_ 818 F.3d 1369, 1376, 118 USPQ2d 1541, 1546 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (eligibility "cannot be furnished by the unpatentable law of nature (or natural phenomenon or abstract idea) itself."). For a claim reciting a judicial exception to be eligible, the additional elements (if any) in the claim must "transform the nature of the claim" into a patent-eligible application of the judicial exception, _Alice Corp.,_ 573 U.S. at 217, 110 USPQ2d at 1981, either at Prong Two or in Step 2B. If there are no additional elements in the claim, then it cannot be eligible. In such a case, after making the appropriate rejection (see **[MPEP § 2106.07](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13fb7_330.html)** for more information on formulating a rejection for lack of eligibility), it is a best practice for the examiner to recommend an amendment, if possible, that would resolve eligibility of the claim.

## B.    **_Evaluating Claims Reciting Multiple Judicial Exceptions_**

A claim may recite multiple judicial exceptions. For example, claim 4 at issue in _Bilski v. Kappos,_ 561 U.S. 593, 95 USPQ2d 1001 (2010) recited two abstract ideas, and the claims at issue in _Mayo Collaborative Servs. v. Prometheus Labs. Inc.,_ 566 U.S. 66, 101 USPQ2d 1961 (2012) recited two laws of nature. However, these claims were analyzed by the Supreme Court in the same manner as claims reciting a single judicial exception, such as those in _Alice Corp.,_ 573 U.S. 208, 110 USPQ2d 1976.

During examination, examiners should apply the same eligibility analysis to all claims regardless of the number of exceptions recited therein. Unless it is clear that a claim recites distinct exceptions, such as a law of nature and an abstract idea, care should be taken not to parse the claim into multiple exceptions, particularly in claims involving abstract ideas. Accordingly, if possible examiners should treat the claim for Prong Two and Step 2B purposes as containing a single judicial exception.

In some claims, the multiple exceptions are distinct from each other, _e.g.,_ a first limitation describes a law of nature, and a second limitation elsewhere in the claim recites an abstract idea. In these cases, for purposes of examination efficiency, examiners should select one of the exceptions and conduct the eligibility analysis for that selected exception. If the analysis indicates that the claim recites an additional element or combination of elements that integrate the selected exception into a practical application or that amount to significantly more than the selected exception, then the claim should be considered patent eligible. On the other hand, if the claim does not recite any additional element or combination of elements that integrate the selected exception into a practical application, and also does not recite any additional element or combination of elements that amounts to significantly more than the selected exception, then the claim should be considered ineligible. _University of Utah Research Foundation v. Ambry Genetics,_ 774 F.3d 755, 762, 113 USPQ2d 1241, 1246 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (because claims did not amount to significantly more than the recited abstract idea, court "need not decide" if claims also recited a law of nature).

In other claims, multiple abstract ideas, which may fall in the same or different groupings, or multiple laws of nature may be recited. In these cases, examiners should not parse the claim. For example, in a claim that includes a series of steps that recite mental steps as well as a mathematical calculation, an examiner should identify the claim as reciting both a mental process and a mathematical concept for Step 2A Prong One to make the analysis clear on the record. However, if possible, the examiner should consider the limitations together as a single abstract idea for Step 2A Prong Two and Step 2B (if necessary) rather than as a plurality of separate abstract ideas to be analyzed individually.

# 2106.04(a)    Abstract Ideas [R-07.2022]

The abstract idea exception has deep roots in the Supreme Court’s jurisprudence. See _Bilski v. Kappos,_ 561 U.S. 593, 601-602, 95 USPQ2d 1001, 1006 (2010) (citing _Le Roy v. Tatham,_ 55 U.S. (14 How.) 156, 174–175 (1853)). Despite this long history, the courts have declined to define abstract ideas. However, it is clear from the body of judicial precedent that software and business methods are not excluded categories of subject matter. For example, the Supreme Court concluded that business methods are not "categorically outside of **[§ 101's](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  scope," stating that "a business method is simply one kind of ‘method’ that is, at least in some circumstances, eligible for patenting under **[§ 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**." _Bilski,_ 561 U.S. at 607, 95 USPQ2d at 1008 (2010). See also _Content Extraction and Transmission, LLC v. Wells Fargo Bank,_ 776 F.3d 1343, 1347, 113 USPQ2d 1354, 1357 (Fed. Cir. 2014) ("there is no categorical business-method exception"). Likewise, software is not automatically an abstract idea, even if performance of a software task involves an underlying mathematical calculation or relationship. See, _e.g., Thales Visionix, Inc. v. United States,_ 850 F.3d 1343, 121 USPQ2d 1898, 1902 (Fed. Cir. 2017) ("That a mathematical equation is required to complete the claimed method and system does not doom the claims to abstraction."); _McRO, Inc. v. Bandai Namco Games Am. Inc.,_ 837 F.3d 1299, 1316, 120 USPQ2d 1091, 1103 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (methods of automatic lip synchronization and facial expression animation using computer-implemented rules were not directed to an abstract idea); _Enfish,_ 822 F.3d 1327, 1336, 118 USPQ2d 1684, 1689 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (claims to self-referential table for a computer database were not directed to an abstract idea).

To facilitate examination, the Office has set forth an approach to identifying abstract ideas that distills the relevant case law into enumerated groupings of abstract ideas. The enumerated groupings are firmly rooted in Supreme Court precedent as well as Federal Circuit decisions interpreting that precedent, as is explained in **[MPEP § 2106.04(a)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13ae3_321.html)**. This approach represents a shift from the former case-comparison approach that required examiners to rely on individual judicial cases when determining whether a claim recites an abstract idea. By grouping the abstract ideas, the examiners’ focus has been shifted from relying on individual cases to generally applying the wide body of case law spanning all technologies and claim types.

The enumerated groupings of abstract ideas are defined as:

- 1) Mathematical concepts – mathematical relationships, mathematical formulas or equations, mathematical calculations (see **[MPEP § 2106.04(a)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13ae3_321.html)**, subsection I);
- 2) Certain methods of organizing human activity – fundamental economic principles or practices (including hedging, insurance, mitigating risk); commercial or legal interactions (including agreements in the form of contracts; legal obligations; advertising, marketing or sales activities or behaviors; business relations); managing personal behavior or relationships or interactions between people (including social activities, teaching, and following rules or instructions) (see **[MPEP § 2106.04(a)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13ae3_321.html)**, subsection II); and
- 3) Mental processes – concepts performed in the human mind (including an observation, evaluation, judgment, opinion) (see **[MPEP § 2106.04(a)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13ae3_321.html)**, subsection III).

Examiners should determine whether a claim recites an abstract idea by (1) identifying the specific limitation(s) in the claim under examination that the examiner believes recites an abstract idea, and (2) determining whether the identified limitations(s) fall within at least one of the groupings of abstract ideas listed above. The groupings of abstract ideas, and their relationship to the body of judicial precedent, are further discussed in **[MPEP § 2106.04(a)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13ae3_321.html)**.

If the identified limitation(s) falls within at least one of the groupings of abstract ideas, it is reasonable to conclude that the claim recites an abstract idea in Step 2A Prong One. The claim then requires further analysis in Step 2A Prong Two, to determine whether any additional elements in the claim integrate the abstract idea into a practical application, see **[MPEP § 2106.04(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d2e7df_235a2_338.html)**.

If the identified limitation(s) do not fall within any of the groupings of abstract ideas, it is reasonable to find that the claim does not recite an abstract idea. This concludes the abstract idea judicial exception eligibility analysis, except in the rare circumstance discussed in **[MPEP § 2106.04(a)(3)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d2ea80_199c8_1c1.html)**, below. The claim is thus eligible at Pathway B unless the claim recites, and is directed to, another exception (such as a law of nature or natural phenomenon).

If the claims recites another judicial exception (i.e. law of nature or natural phenomenon), see **[MPEP §§ 2106.04(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13b6b_4c.html)** and **[2106.04(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13bc1_b1.html)** for more information on Step 2A analysis.

**[MPEP § 2106.04(a)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13b3e_21.html)** provides examples of claims that do not recite abstract ideas (or other judicial exceptions) and thus are eligible at Step 2A Prong One.

**[MPEP § 2106.04(a)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13ae3_321.html)** provides further explanation on the abstract idea groupings. It should be noted that these groupings are not mutually exclusive, i.e., some claims recite limitations that fall within more than one grouping or sub-grouping. For example, a claim reciting performing mathematical calculations using a formula that could be practically performed in the human mind may be considered to fall within the mathematical concepts grouping and the mental process grouping. Accordingly, examiners should identify at least one abstract idea grouping, but preferably identify all groupings to the extent possible, if a claim limitation(s) is determined to fall within multiple groupings and proceed with the analysis in Step 2A Prong Two.

# 2106.04(a)(1)    Examples of Claims That Do Not Recite Abstract Ideas [R-10.2019]

When evaluating a claim to determine whether it recites an abstract idea, examiners should keep in mind that while "all inventions at some level embody, use, reflect, rest upon, or apply laws of nature, natural phenomenon, or abstract ideas", not all claims recite an abstract idea. See _Alice Corp. Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank, Int’l,_ 573 U.S. 208, 217, 110 USPQ2d 1976, 1980-81 (2014) (citing _Mayo Collaborative Servs. v. Prometheus Labs. Inc.,_ 566 US 66, 71, 101 USPQ2d 1961, 1965 (2012)). The Step 2A Prong One analysis articulated in **[MPEP § 2106.04](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_139db_e0.html)** accounts for this cautionary principle by requiring a claim to recite (_i.e.,_ set forth or describe) an abstract idea in Prong One before proceeding to the Prong Two inquiry about whether the claim is directed to that idea, thereby separating claims reciting abstract ideas from those that are merely based on or involve an abstract idea.

Some claims are not directed to an abstract idea because they do not recite an abstract idea, although it may be apparent that at some level they are based on or involve an abstract idea. Because these claims do not recite an abstract idea (or other judicial exception), they are eligible at Step 2A Prong One (Pathway B).

Non-limiting hypothetical examples of claims that do not recite (set forth or describe) an abstract idea include:

- i. a printer comprising a belt, a roller, a printhead and at least one ink cartridge;
- ii. a washing machine comprising a tub, a drive motor operatively connected to the tub, a controller for controlling the drive motor, and a housing for containing the tub, drive motor, and controller;
- iii. an earring comprising a sensor for taking periodic blood glucose measurements and a memory for storing measurement data from the sensor;
- iv. a method for sequencing BRCA1 gene sequences comprising: amplifying by a polymerization chain reaction technique all or part of a BRCA1 gene from a tissue sample from a human subject using a set of primers to produce amplified nucleic acids; and sequencing the amplified nucleic acids;
- v. a method for loading BIOS into a local computer system which has a system processor and volatile memory and non-volatile memory, the method comprising the steps of: responding to powering up of the local computer system by requesting from a memory location remote from the local computer system the transfer to and storage in the volatile memory of the local computer system of BIOS configured for effective use of the local computer system, transferring and storing such BIOS, and transferring control of the local computer system to such BIOS;
- vi. a method of rearranging icons on a graphical user interface (GUI) comprising the steps of: receiving a user selection to organize each icon based on the amount of use of each icon, determining the amount of use of each icon by using a processor to track the amount of memory allocated to the application associated with the icon over a period of time, and automatically moving the most used icons to a position in the GUI closest to the start icon of the computer system based on the determined amount of use; and

# 2106.04(a)(2)    Abstract Idea Groupings [R-07.2022]

## I.    **MATHEMATICAL CONCEPTS**

The mathematical concepts grouping is defined as mathematical relationships, mathematical formulas or equations, and mathematical calculations. The Supreme Court has identified a number of concepts falling within this grouping as abstract ideas including: a procedure for converting binary-coded decimal numerals into pure binary form, _Gottschalk v. Benson,_ 409 U.S. 63, 65, 175 USPQ2d 673, 674 (1972); a mathematical formula for calculating an alarm limit, _Parker v. Flook,_ 437 U.S. 584, 588-89, 198 USPQ2d 193, 195 (1978); the Arrhenius equation, _Diamond v. Diehr,_ 450 U.S. 175, 191, 209 USPQ 1, 15 (1981); and a mathematical formula for hedging, _Bilski v. Kappos,_ 561 U.S. 593, 611, 95 USPQ 2d 1001, 1004 (2010).

The Court’s rationale for identifying these "mathematical concepts" as judicial exceptions is that a ‘‘mathematical formula as such is not accorded the protection of our patent laws,’’ _Diehr,_ 450 U.S. at 191, 209 USPQ at 15 (citing _Benson,_ 409 U.S. 63, 175 USPQ 673), and thus ‘‘the discovery of [a mathematical formula] cannot support a patent unless there is some other inventive concept in its application.’’ _Flook,_ 437 U.S. at 594, 198 USPQ at 199. In the past, the Supreme Court sometimes described mathematical concepts as laws of nature, and at other times described these concepts as judicial exceptions without specifying a particular type of exception. See, _e.g., Benson,_ 409 U.S. at 65, 175 USPQ2d at 674; _Flook,_ 437 U.S. at 589, 198 USPQ2d at 197; _Mackay Radio & Telegraph Co. v. Radio Corp. of Am.,_ 306 U.S. 86, 94, 40 USPQ 199, 202 (1939) (‘‘[A] scientific truth, or the mathematical expression of it, is not patentable invention[.]’’). More recent opinions of the Supreme Court, however, have affirmatively characterized mathematical relationships and formulas as abstract ideas. See, _e.g., Alice Corp. Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank Int’l_, 573 U.S. 208, 218, 110 USPQ2d 1976, 1981 (2014) (describing _Flook_ as holding "that a mathematical formula for computing ‘alarm limits’ in a catalytic conversion process was also a patent-ineligible abstract idea."); _Bilski v. Kappos,_ 561 U.S. 593, 611-12, 95 USPQ2d 1001, 1010 (2010) (noting that the claimed "concept of hedging, described in claim 1 and reduced to a mathematical formula in claim 4, is an unpatentable abstract idea,").

When determining whether a claim recites a mathematical concept (_i.e.,_ mathematical relationships, mathematical formulas or equations, and mathematical calculations), examiners should consider whether the claim recites a mathematical concept or merely limitations that are based on or involve a mathematical concept. A claim does not recite a mathematical concept (_i.e.,_ the claim limitations do not fall within the mathematical concept grouping), if it is only based on or involves a mathematical concept. See, _e.g., Thales Visionix, Inc. v. United States,_ 850 F.3d 1343, 1348-49, 121 USPQ2d 1898, 1902-03 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (determining that the claims to a particular configuration of inertial sensors and a particular method of using the raw data from the sensors in order to more accurately calculate the position and orientation of an object on a moving platform did not merely recite "the abstract idea of using ‘mathematical equations for determining the relative position of a moving object to a moving reference frame’."). For example, a limitation that is merely based on or involves a mathematical concept described in the specification may not be sufficient to fall into this grouping, provided the mathematical concept itself is not recited in the claim.

It is important to note that a mathematical concept need not be expressed in mathematical symbols, because "[w]ords used in a claim operating on data to solve a problem can serve the same purpose as a formula." _In re Grams,_ 888 F.2d 835, 837 and n.1, 12 USPQ2d 1824, 1826 and n.1 (Fed. Cir. 1989). See, _e.g., SAP America, Inc. v. InvestPic, LLC,_ 898 F.3d 1161, 1163, 127 USPQ2d 1597, 1599 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (holding that claims to a ‘‘series of mathematical calculations based on selected information’’ are directed to abstract ideas); _Digitech Image Techs., LLC v. Elecs. for Imaging, Inc.,_ 758 F.3d 1344, 1350, 111 USPQ2d 1717, 1721 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (holding that claims to a ‘‘process of organizing information through mathematical correlations’’ are directed to an abstract idea); and _Bancorp Servs., LLC v. Sun Life Assurance Co. of Can. (U.S.),_ 687 F.3d 1266, 1280, 103 USPQ2d 1425, 1434 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (identifying the concept of ‘‘managing a stable value protected life insurance policy by performing calculations and manipulating the results’’ as an abstract idea).

## A.    **_Mathematical Relationships_**

A mathematical relationship is a relationship between variables or numbers. A mathematical relationship may be expressed in words or using mathematical symbols. For example, pressure (p) can be described as the ratio between the magnitude of the normal force (F) and area of the surface on contact (A), or it can be set forth in the form of an equation such as p = F/A.

Examples of mathematical relationships recited in a claim include:

- i. a relationship between reaction rate and temperature, which relationship can be expressed in the form of a formula called the Arrhenius equation, _Diamond v. Diehr;_ 450 U.S. at 178 n. 2, 179 n.5, 191-92, 209 USPQ at 4-5 (1981);
- ii. a conversion between binary coded decimal and pure binary, _Benson,_ 409 U.S. at 64, 175 USPQ at 674;
- iii. a mathematical relationship between enhanced directional radio activity and antenna conductor arrangement (_i.e.,_ the length of the conductors with respect to the operating wave length and the angle between the conductors), _Mackay Radio & Tel. Co. v. Radio Corp. of America,_ 306 U.S. 86, 91, 40 USPQ 199, 201 (1939) (while the litigated claims 15 and 16 of U.S. Patent No. 1,974,387 expressed this mathematical relationship using a formula that described the angle between the conductors, other claims in the patent (_e.g.,_ claim 1) expressed the mathematical relationship in words); and
- iv. organizing information and manipulating information through mathematical correlations, _Digitech Image Techs., LLC v. Electronics for Imaging, Inc.,_ 758 F.3d 1344, 1350, 111 USPQ2d 1717, 1721 (Fed. Cir. 2014). The patentee in _Digitech_ claimed methods of generating first and second data by taking existing information, manipulating the data using mathematical functions, and organizing this information into a new form. The court explained that such claims were directed to an abstract idea because they described a process of organizing information through mathematical correlations, like _Flook's_ method of calculating using a mathematical formula. 758 F.3d at 1350, 111 USPQ2d at 1721.

## B.    **_Mathematical Formulas or Equations_**

A claim that recites a numerical formula or equation will be considered as falling within the "mathematical concepts" grouping. In addition, there are instances where a formula or equation is written in text format that should also be considered as falling within this grouping. For example, the phrase "determining a ratio of A to B" is merely using a textual replacement for the particular equation (ratio = A/B). Additionally, the phrase "calculating the force of the object by multiplying its mass by its acceleration" is using a textual replacement for the particular equation (F= ma).

Examples of mathematical equations or formulas recited in a claim include:

- i. a formula describing certain electromagnetic standing wave phenomena, _Mackay Radio & Tel. Co. v. Radio Corp. of America,_ 306 U.S. 86, 91, 40 USPQ 199, 201 (1939) (50.9(l/lambda<-0.513>);
- ii. the Arrhenius equation, _Diamond v. Diehr;_ 450 U.S. 175, 178 n. 2, 179 n.5, 191-92, 209 USPQ at 4-5 (1981) (ln v = CZ + x);
- iii. a formula for computing an alarm limit, _Parker v. Flook,_ 437 U.S. 584, 585, 198 USPQ 193, 195 (1978) (B1=B0 (1.0–F) + PVL(F)); and
- iv. a mathematical formula for hedging (claim 4), _Bilski v. Kappos,_ 561 U.S. 593, 599, 95 USPQ2d 1001, 1004 (2010) (Fixed Bill Price = Fi + [(Ci + Ti + LDi) x (α + βE(Wi))]).

## C.    **_Mathematical Calculations_**

A claim that recites a mathematical calculation, when the claim is given its broadest reasonable interpretation in light of the specification, will be considered as falling within the "mathematical concepts" grouping. A mathematical calculation is a mathematical operation (such as multiplication) or an act of calculating using mathematical methods to determine a variable or number, _e.g.,_ performing an arithmetic operation such as exponentiation. There is no particular word or set of words that indicates a claim recites a mathematical calculation. That is, a claim does not have to recite the word "calculating" in order to be considered a mathematical calculation. For example, a step of "determining" a variable or number using mathematical methods or "performing" a mathematical operation may also be considered mathematical calculations when the broadest reasonable interpretation of the claim in light of the specification encompasses a mathematical calculation.

Examples of mathematical calculations recited in a claim include:

- i. performing a resampled statistical analysis to generate a resampled distribution, _SAP America, Inc. v. InvestPic, LLC,_ 898 F.3d 1161, 1163-65, 127 USPQ2d 1597, 1598-1600 (Fed. Cir. 2018), modifying _SAP America, Inc. v. InvestPic, LLC,_ 890 F.3d 1016, 126 USPQ2d 1638 (Fed. Cir. 2018);
- ii. calculating a number representing an alarm limit value using the mathematical formula ‘‘B1=B0 (1.0–F) + PVL(F)’’, _Parker v. Flook,_ 437 U.S. 584, 585, 198 USPQ 193, 195 (1978);
- iii. using a formula to convert geospatial coordinates into natural numbers, _Burnett v. Panasonic Corp.,_ 741 Fed. Appx. 777, 780 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (non-precedential);
- iv. managing a stable value protected life insurance policy via performing calculations, _Bancorp Servs., LLC v. Sun Life Assur. Co. of Canada (U.S.)_, 687 F.3d 1266, 1280, 103 USPQ2d 1425, 1434 (Fed. Cir. 2012);
- v. using an algorithm for determining the optimal number of visits by a business representative to a client, _In re Maucorps,_ 609 F.2d 481, 482, 203 USPQ 812, 813 (CCPA 1979); and
- vi. calculating the difference between local and average data values, _In re Abele,_ 684 F.2d 902, 903, 214 USPQ 682, 683-84 (CCPA 1982).

## II.    **CERTAIN METHODS OF ORGANIZING HUMAN ACTIVITY**

The phrase "methods of organizing human activity" is used to describe concepts relating to:

- • fundamental economic principles or practices (including hedging, insurance, mitigating risk);
- • commercial or legal interactions (including agreements in the form of contracts, legal obligations, advertising, marketing or sales activities or behaviors, and business relations); and
- • managing personal behavior or relationships or interactions between people, (including social activities, teaching, and following rules or instructions).

The Supreme Court has identified a number of concepts falling within the "certain methods of organizing human activity" grouping as abstract ideas. In particular, in _Alice,_ the Court concluded that the use of a third party to mediate settlement risk is a ‘‘fundamental economic practice’’ and thus an abstract idea. 573 U.S. at 219–20, 110 USPQ2d at 1982. In addition, the Court in _Alice_ described the concept of risk hedging identified as an abstract idea in _Bilski_ as ‘‘a method of organizing human activity’’. _Id._ Previously, in _Bilski,_ the Court concluded that hedging is a ‘‘fundamental economic practice’’ and therefore an abstract idea. 561 U.S. at 611–612, 95 USPQ2d at 1010.

The term "certain" qualifies the "certain methods of organizing human activity" grouping as a reminder of several important points. First, not all methods of organizing human activity are abstract ideas (_e.g.,_ "a defined set of steps for combining particular ingredients to create a drug formulation" is not a certain "method of organizing human activity"), _In re Marco Guldenaar Holding B.V.,_ 911 F.3d 1157, 1160-61, 129 USPQ2d 1008, 1011 (Fed. Cir. 2018). Second, this grouping is limited to activity that falls within the enumerated sub-groupings of fundamental economic principles or practices, commercial or legal interactions, and managing personal behavior and relationships or interactions between people, and is not to be expanded beyond these enumerated sub-groupings except in rare circumstances as explained in **[MPEP § 2106.04(a)(3)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d2ea80_199c8_1c1.html)**. Finally, the sub-groupings encompass both activity of a single person (for example, a person following a set of instructions or a person signing a contract online) and activity that involves multiple people (such as a commercial interaction), and thus, certain activity between a person and a computer (for example a method of anonymous loan shopping that a person conducts using a mobile phone) may fall within the "certain methods of organizing human activity" grouping. It is noted that the number of people involved in the activity is not dispositive as to whether a claim limitation falls within this grouping. Instead, the determination should be based on whether the activity itself falls within one of the sub-groupings.

## A.    **_Fundamental Economic Practices or Principles_**

The courts have used the phrases "fundamental economic practices" or "fundamental economic principles" to describe concepts relating to the economy and commerce. Fundamental economic principles or practices include hedging, insurance, and mitigating risks.

The term "fundamental" is not used in the sense of necessarily being "old" or "well-known." See, _e.g., OIP Techs., Inc. v. Amazon.com, Inc._, 788 F.3d 1359, 1364, 115 U.S.P.Q.2d 1090, 1092 (Fed Cir. 2015) (a new method of price optimization was found to be a fundamental economic concept); _In re Smith,_ 815 F.3d 816, 818-19, 118 USPQ2d 1245, 1247 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (describing a new set of rules for conducting a wagering game as a "fundamental economic practice"); _In re Greenstein,_ 774 Fed. Appx. 661, 664, 2019 USPQ2d 212400 (Fed Cir. 2019) (non-precedential) (claims to a new method of allocating returns to different investors in an investment fund was a fundamental economic concept). However, being old or well-known may indicate that the practice is fundamental. See, _e.g., Alice Corp. Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank Int’l,_ 573 U.S. 208, 219-20, 110 USPQ2d 1981-82 (2014) (describing the concept of intermediated settlement, like the risk hedging in _Bilski,_ to be a "‘fundamental economic practice long prevalent in our system of commerce’" and also as "a building block of the modern economy") (citation omitted); _Bilski v. Kappos,_ 561 U.S. 593, 611, 95 USPQ2d 1001, 1010 (2010) (claims to the concept of hedging are a "fundamental economic practice long prevalent in our system of commerce and taught in any introductory finance class.") (citation omitted); _Intellectual Ventures I LLC v. Symantec Corp.,_ 838 F.3d 1307, 1313, 120 USPQ2d 1353, 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("The category of abstract ideas embraces ‘fundamental economic practice[s] long prevalent in our system of commerce,’ … including ‘longstanding commercial practice[s]’").

An example of a case identifying a claim as reciting a fundamental economic practice is _Bilski v. Kappos,_ 561 U.S. 593, 609, 95 USPQ2d 1001, 1009 (2010). The fundamental economic practice at issue was hedging or protecting against risk. The applicant in _Bilski_ claimed "a series of steps instructing how to hedge risk," _i.e.,_ how to protect against risk. 561 U.S. at 599, 95 USPQ2d at 1005. The method allowed energy suppliers and consumers to minimize the risks resulting from fluctuations in market demand for energy. The Supreme Court determined that hedging is "fundamental economic practice" and therefore is an "unpatentable abstract idea." 561 U.S. at 611-12, 95 USPQ2d at 1010.

Another example of a case identifying a claim as reciting a fundamental economic practice is _Bancorp Services., L.L.C. v. Sun Life Assurance Co. of Canada (U.S.),_ 687 F.3d 1266, 103 USPQ2d 1425 (Fed. Cir. 2012). The fundamental economic practice at issue in _Bancorp_ pertained to insurance. The patentee in _Bancorp_ claimed methods and systems for managing a life insurance policy on behalf of a policy holder, which comprised steps including generating a life insurance policy including a stable value protected investment with an initial value based on a value of underlying securities, calculating surrender value protected investment credits for the life insurance policy; determining an investment value and a value of the underlying securities for the current day; and calculating a policy value and a policy unit value for the current day. 687 F.3d at 1270-71, 103 USPQ2d at 1427. The court described the claims as an "attempt to patent the use of the abstract idea of [managing a stable value protected life insurance policy] and then instruct the use of well-known [calculations] to help establish some of the inputs into the equation." 687 F.3d at 1278, 103 USPQ2d at 1433 (alterations in original) (citing _Bilski_).

Other examples of "fundamental economic principles or practices" include:

- i. mitigating settlement risk, _Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank,_573 U.S. 208, 218, 110 USPQ2d 1976, 1982 (2014);
- ii. rules for conducting a wagering game, _In re Smith,_ 815 F.3d 816, 818-19, 118 USPQ2d 1245, 1247 (Fed. Cir. 2016);
- iii. financial instruments that are designed to protect against the risk of investing in financial instruments, _In re Chorna,_ 656 Fed. App'x 1016, 1021 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (non-precedential);
- iv. offer-based price optimization, _OIP Techs., Inc. v. Amazon.com, Inc.,_ 788 F.3d 1359, 1362–63, 115 USPQ2d 1090, 1092-93 (Fed. Cir. 2015);
- v. local processing of payments for remotely purchased goods, _Inventor Holdings, LLC v. Bed Bath Beyond,_ 876 F.3d 1372, 1378-79, 125 USPQ2d 1019, 1023 (Fed. Cir. 2017);
- vi. using a marking affixed to the outside of a mail object to communicate information about the mail object, _i.e.,_ the sender, recipient, and contents of the mail object, _Secured Mail Solutions LLC v. Universal Wilde, Inc.,_ 873 F.3d 905, 911, 124 USPQ2d 1502, 1506 (Fed. Cir. 2017); and
- vii. placing an order based on displayed market information, _Trading Technologies Int’l, Inc. v. IBG LLC,_ 921 F.3d 1084, 1092, 2019 USPQ2d 138290 (Fed. Cir. 2019).

## B.    **_Commercial or Legal Interactions_**

"Commercial interactions" or "legal interactions" include agreements in the form of contracts, legal obligations, advertising, marketing or sales activities or behaviors, and business relations.

An example of a claim reciting a commercial or legal interaction, where the interaction is an agreement in the form of contracts, is found in _buySAFE, Inc. v. Google, Inc.,_ 765 F.3d. 1350, 112 USPQ2d 1093 (Fed. Cir. 2014). The agreement at issue in _buySAFE_ was a transaction performance guaranty, which is a contractual relationship. 765 F.3d at 1355, 112 USPQ2d at 1096. The patentee claimed a method in which a computer operated by the provider of a safe transaction service receives a request for a performance guarantee for an online commercial transaction, the computer processes the request by underwriting the requesting party in order to provide the transaction guarantee service, and the computer offers, via a computer network, a transaction guaranty that binds to the transaction upon the closing of the transaction. 765 F.3d at 1351-52, 112 USPQ2d at 1094. The Federal Circuit described the claims as directed to an abstract idea because they were "squarely about creating a contractual relationship--a ‘transaction performance guaranty’." 765 F.3d at 1355, 112 USPQ2d at 1096.

Other examples of subject matter where the commercial or legal interaction is an agreement in the form of contracts include:

- i. managing a stable value protected life insurance policy via performing calculations, _Bancorp Servs., LLC v. Sun Life Assur. Co. of Canada (U.S.),_ 687 F.3d 1266, 1280, 103 USPQ2d 1425, 1434 (Fed. Cir. 2012); and
- ii. processing insurance claims for a covered loss or policy event under an insurance policy (_i.e.,_ an agreement in the form of a contract), _Accenture Global Services v. Guidewire Software, Inc.,_ 728 F.3d 1336, 1338-39, 108 USPQ2d 1173, 1175-76 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

An example of a claim reciting a commercial or legal interaction in the form of a legal obligation is found in _Fort Properties, Inc. v. American Master Lease, LLC,_ 671 F.3d 1317, 101 USPQ2d 1785 (Fed Cir. 2012). The patentee claimed a method of "aggregating real property into a real estate portfolio, dividing the interests in the portfolio into a number of deedshares, and subjecting those shares to a master agreement." 671 F.3d at 1322, 101 USPQ2d at 1788. The legal obligation at issue was the tax-free exchanges of real estate. The Federal Circuit concluded that the real estate investment tool designed to enable tax-free exchanges was an abstract concept. 671 F.3d at 1323, 101 USPQ2d at 1789.

Other examples of subject matter where the commercial or legal interaction is a legal obligation include:

- i. hedging, _Bilski v. Kappos_, 561 U.S. 593, 595, 95 USPQ2d 1001, 1004 (2010);
- ii. mitigating settlement risk, _Alice Corp. Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank Int'l,_ 573 U.S. 208, 218, 110 USPQ2d 1976, 1979 (2014); and
- iii. arbitration, _In re Comiskey_, 554 F.3d 967, 981, 89 USPQ2d 1655, 1665 (Fed. Cir. 2009).

An example of a claim reciting advertising is found in _Ultramercial, Inc. v. Hulu, LLC,_ 772 F.3d 709, 714-15, 112 USPQ2d 1750, 1753-54 (Fed. Cir. 2014). The patentee in _Ultramercial_ claimed an eleven-step method for displaying an advertisement (ad) in exchange for access to copyrighted media, comprising steps of receiving copyrighted media, selecting an ad, offering the media in exchange for watching the selected ad, displaying the ad, allowing the consumer access to the media, and receiving payment from the sponsor of the ad. 772 F.3d. at 715, 112 USPQ2d at 1754. The Federal Circuit determined that the "combination of steps recites an abstraction—an idea, having no particular concrete or tangible form" and thus was directed to an abstract idea, which the court described as "using advertising as an exchange or currency." _Id._

Other examples of subject matter where the commercial or legal interaction is advertising, marketing or sales activities or behaviors include:

- i. structuring a sales force or marketing company, which pertains to marketing or sales activities or behaviors, _In re Ferguson,_ 558 F.3d 1359, 1364, 90 USPQ2d 1035, 1038 (Fed. Cir. 2009);
- ii. using an algorithm for determining the optimal number of visits by a business representative to a client, _In re Maucorps,_ 609 F.2d 481, 485, 203 USPQ 812, 816 (CCPA 1979); and
- iii. offer-based price optimization, which pertains to marketing, _OIP Techs., Inc. v. Amazon.com, Inc.,_ 788 F.3d 1359, 1362-63, 115 USPQ2d 1090, 1092 (Fed. Cir. 2015).

An example of a claim reciting business relations is found in _Credit Acceptance Corp. v. Westlake Services,_ 859 F.3d 1044, 123 USPQ2d 1100 (Fed. Cir. 2017). The business relation at issue in _Credit Acceptance_ is the relationship between a customer and dealer when processing a credit application to purchase a vehicle. The patentee claimed a "system for maintaining a database of information about the items in a dealer’s inventory, obtaining financial information about a customer from a user, combining these two sources of information to create a financing package for each of the inventoried items, and presenting the financing packages to the user." 859 F.3d at 1054, 123 USPQ2d at 1108. The Federal Circuit described the claims as directed to the abstract idea of "processing an application for financing a loan" and found "no meaningful distinction between this type of financial industry practice" and the concept of intermediated settlement in _Alice_ or the hedging concept in _Bilski._ 859 F.3d at 1054, 123 USPQ2d at 1108.

Another example of subject matter where the commercial or legal interaction is business relations includes:

- i. processing information through a clearing-house, where the business relation is the relationship between a party submitted a credit application (_e.g.,_ a car dealer) and funding sources (_e.g.,_ banks) when processing credit applications, _Dealertrack v. Huber,_ 674 F.3d 1315, 1331, 101 USPQ2d 1325, 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2012).

## C.    **_Managing Personal Behavior or Relationships or Interactions Between People_**

The sub-grouping "managing personal behavior or relationships or interactions between people" include social activities, teaching, and following rules or instructions.

An example of a claim reciting managing personal behavior is _Intellectual Ventures I LLC v. Capital One Bank (USA),_ 792 F.3d 1363, 115 USPQ2d 1636 (Fed. Cir. 2015). The patentee in this case claimed methods comprising storing user-selected pre-set limits on spending in a database, and when one of the limits is reached, communicating a notification to the user via a device. 792 F.3d. at 1367, 115 USPQ2d at 1639-40. The Federal Circuit determined that the claims were directed to the abstract idea of "tracking financial transactions to determine whether they exceed a pre-set spending limit (_i.e.,_ budgeting)", which "is not meaningfully different from the ideas found to be abstract in other cases before the Supreme Court and our court involving methods of organizing human activity." 792 F.3d. at 1367-68, 115 USPQ2d at 1640.

Other examples of managing personal behavior recited in a claim include:

- i. filtering content, _BASCOM Global Internet v. AT&T Mobility, LLC,_ 827 F.3d 1341, 1345-46, 119 USPQ2d 1236, 1239 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (finding that filtering content was an abstract idea under step 2A, but reversing an invalidity judgment of ineligibility due to an inadequate step 2B analysis);
- ii. considering historical usage information while inputting data, _BSG Tech. LLC v. Buyseasons, Inc.,_ 899 F.3d 1281, 1286, 127 USPQ2d 1688, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2018); and
- iii. a mental process that a neurologist should follow when testing a patient for nervous system malfunctions, _In re Meyer,_ 688 F.2d 789, 791-93, 215 USPQ 193, 194-96 (CCPA 1982).

An example of a claim reciting social activities is _Voter Verified, Inc. v. Election Systems & Software, LLC,_ 887 F.3d 1376, 126 USPQ2d 1498 (Fed. Cir. 2018). The social activity at issue in _Voter Verified_ was voting. The patentee claimed "[a] method for voting providing for self-verification of a ballot comprising the steps of" presenting an election ballot for voting, accepting input of the votes, storing the votes, printing out the votes, comparing the printed votes to votes stored in the computer, and determining whether the printed ballot is acceptable. 887 F.3d at 1384-85, 126 USPQ2d at 1503-04. The Federal Circuit found that the claims were directed to the abstract idea of "voting, verifying the vote, and submitting the vote for tabulation", which is a "fundamental activity that forms the basis of our democracy" and has been performed by humans for hundreds of years. 887 F.3d at 1385-86, 126 USPQ2d at 1504-05.

Another example of a claim reciting social activities is _Interval Licensing LLC, v. AOL, Inc.,_ 896 F.3d 1335, 127 USPQ2d 1553 (Fed. Cir. 2018). The social activity at issue was the social activity of "’providing information to a person without interfering with the person’s primary activity.’" 896 F.3d at 1344, 127 USPQ2d 1553 (citing _Interval Licensing LLC v. AOL, Inc.,_ 193 F. Supp.3d 1184, 1188 (W.D. 2014)). The patentee claimed an attention manager for acquiring content from an information source, controlling the timing of the display of acquired content, displaying the content, and acquiring an updated version of the previously-acquired content when the information source updates its content. 896 F.3d at 1339-40, 127 USPQ2d at 1555. The Federal Circuit concluded that "[s]tanding alone, the act of providing someone an additional set of information without disrupting the ongoing provision of an initial set of information is an abstract idea," observing that the district court "pointed to the nontechnical human activity of passing a note to a person who is in the middle of a meeting or conversation as further illustrating the basic, longstanding practice that is the focus of the [patent ineligible] claimed invention." 896 F.3d at 1344-45, 127 USPQ2d at 1559.

An example of a claim reciting following rules or instructions is _In re Marco Guldenaar Holding B.V.,_ 911 F.3d 1157, 1161, 129 USPQ2d 1008, 1011 (Fed. Cir. 2018). The patentee claimed a method of playing a dice game including placing wagers on whether certain die faces will appear face up. 911 F.3d at 1160; 129 USPQ2d at 1011. The Federal Circuit determined that the claims were directed to the abstract idea of "rules for playing games", which the court characterized as a certain method of organizing human activity. 911 F.3d at 1160-61; 129 USPQ2d at 1011.

Other examples of following rules or instructions recited in a claim include:

- i. assigning hair designs to balance head shape, _In re Brown_, 645 Fed. Appx. 1014, 1015-16 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (non-precedential); and
- ii. a series of instructions of how to hedge risk, _Bilski v. Kappos_, 561 U.S. 593, 595, 95 USPQ2d 1001, 1004 (2010).

## III.    **MENTAL PROCESSES**

The courts consider a mental process (thinking) that "can be performed in the human mind, or by a human using a pen and paper" to be an abstract idea. _CyberSource Corp. v. Retail Decisions, Inc.,_ 654 F.3d 1366, 1372, 99 USPQ2d 1690, 1695 (Fed. Cir. 2011). As the Federal Circuit explained, "methods which can be performed mentally, or which are the equivalent of human mental work, are unpatentable abstract ideas the ‘basic tools of scientific and technological work’ that are open to all.’" 654 F.3d at 1371, 99 USPQ2d at 1694 (citing _Gottschalk v. Benson,_ 409 U.S. 63, 175 USPQ 673 (1972)). See also _Mayo Collaborative Servs. v. Prometheus Labs. Inc.,_ 566 U.S. 66, 71, 101 USPQ2d 1961, 1965 (2012) ("‘[M]ental processes[] and abstract intellectual concepts are not patentable, as they are the basic tools of scientific and technological work’" (quoting _Benson,_ 409 U.S. at 67, 175 USPQ at 675)); _Parker v. Flook,_ 437 U.S. 584, 589, 198 USPQ 193, 197 (1978) (same).

Accordingly, the "mental processes" abstract idea grouping is defined as concepts performed in the human mind, and examples of mental processes include observations, evaluations, judgments, and opinions. A discussion of concepts performed in the human mind, as well as concepts that cannot practically be performed in the human mind and thus are not "mental processes", is provided below with respect to point A.

The courts do not distinguish between mental processes that are performed entirely in the human mind and mental processes that require a human to use a physical aid (_e.g.,_ pen and paper or a slide rule) to perform the claim limitation. See, _e.g., Benson,_ 409 U.S. at 67, 65, 175 USPQ at 674-75, 674 (noting that the claimed "conversion of [binary-coded decimal] numerals to pure binary numerals can be done mentally," _i.e.,_ "as a person would do it by head and hand."); _Synopsys, Inc. v. Mentor Graphics Corp.,_ 839 F.3d 1138, 1139, 120 USPQ2d 1473, 1474 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (holding that claims to a mental process of "translating a functional description of a logic circuit into a hardware component description of the logic circuit" are directed to an abstract idea, because the claims "read on an individual performing the claimed steps mentally or with pencil and paper"). Mental processes performed by humans with the assistance of physical aids such as pens or paper are explained further below with respect to point B.

Nor do the courts distinguish between claims that recite mental processes performed by humans and claims that recite mental processes performed on a computer. As the Federal Circuit has explained, "[c]ourts have examined claims that required the use of a computer and still found that the underlying, patent-ineligible invention could be performed via pen and paper or in a person’s mind." _Versata Dev. Group v. SAP Am., Inc.,_ 793 F.3d 1306, 1335, 115 USPQ2d 1681, 1702 (Fed. Cir. 2015). See also _Intellectual Ventures I LLC v. Symantec Corp.,_ 838 F.3d 1307, 1318, 120 USPQ2d 1353, 1360 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (‘‘[W]ith the exception of generic computer-implemented steps, there is nothing in the claims themselves that foreclose them from being performed by a human, mentally or with pen and paper.’’); _Mortgage Grader, Inc. v. First Choice Loan Servs. Inc.,_ 811 F.3d 1314, 1324, 117 USPQ2d 1693, 1699 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (holding that computer-implemented method for "anonymous loan shopping" was an abstract idea because it could be "performed by humans without a computer"). Mental processes recited in claims that require computers are explained further below with respect to point C.

Because both product and process claims may recite a "mental process", the phrase "mental processes" should be understood as referring to the type of abstract idea, and not to the statutory category of the claim. The courts have identified numerous product claims as reciting mental process-type abstract ideas, for instance the product claims to computer systems and computer-readable media in _Versata Dev. Group. v. SAP Am., Inc.,_ 793 F.3d 1306, 115 USPQ2d 1681 (Fed. Cir. 2015). This concept is explained further below with respect to point D.

The following discussion is meant to guide examiners and provide more information on how to determine whether a claim recites a mental process. Examiners should keep in mind the following points A, B, C, and D when performing this evaluation.

## A.    **_A Claim With Limitation(s) That Cannot Practically be Performed in the Human Mind Does Not Recite a Mental Process_**

Claims do not recite a mental process when they do not contain limitations that can practically be performed in the human mind, for instance when the human mind is not equipped to perform the claim limitations. See _SRI Int’l, Inc. v. Cisco Systems, Inc.,_ 930 F.3d 1295, 1304 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (declining to identify the claimed collection and analysis of network data as abstract because "the human mind is not equipped to detect suspicious activity by using network monitors and analyzing network packets as recited by the claims"); _CyberSource,_ 654 F.3d at 1376, 99 USPQ2d at 1699 (distinguishing _Research Corp. Techs. v. Microsoft Corp.,_ 627 F.3d 859, 97 USPQ2d 1274 (Fed. Cir. 2010), and _SiRF Tech., Inc. v. Int’l Trade Comm’n,_ 601 F.3d 1319, 94 USPQ2d 1607 (Fed. Cir. 2010), as directed to inventions that ‘‘could not, as a practical matter, be performed entirely in a human’s mind’’).

Examples of claims that do not recite mental processes because they cannot be practically performed in the human mind include:

- • a claim to a method for calculating an absolute position of a GPS receiver and an absolute time of reception of satellite signals, where the claimed GPS receiver calculated pseudoranges that estimated the distance from the GPS receiver to a plurality of satellites, _SiRF Tech.,_ 601 F.3d at 1331-33, 94 USPQ2d at 1616-17;
- • a claim to detecting suspicious activity by using network monitors and analyzing network packets, _SRI Int’l,_ 930 F.3d at 1304;
- • a claim to a specific data encryption method for computer communication involving a several-step manipulation of data, _Synopsys.,_ 839 F.3d at 1148, 120 USPQ2d at 1481 (distinguishing the claims in _TQP Development, LLC v. Intuit Inc.,_ 2014 WL 651935 (E.D. Tex. 2014)); and
- • a claim to a method for rendering a halftone image of a digital image by comparing, pixel by pixel, the digital image against a blue noise mask, where the method required the manipulation of computer data structures (_e.g.,_ the pixels of a digital image and a two-dimensional array known as a mask) and the output of a modified computer data structure (a halftoned digital image), _Research Corp. Techs.,_ 627 F.3d at 868, 97 USPQ2d at 1280.

In contrast, claims do recite a mental process when they contain limitations that can practically be performed in the human mind, including for example, observations, evaluations, judgments, and opinions. Examples of claims that recite mental processes include:

- • a claim to "collecting information, analyzing it, and displaying certain results of the collection and analysis," where the data analysis steps are recited at a high level of generality such that they could practically be performed in the human mind, _Electric Power Group v. Alstom, S.A.,_ 830 F.3d 1350, 1353-54, 119 USPQ2d 1739, 1741-42 (Fed. Cir. 2016);
- • claims to "comparing BRCA sequences and determining the existence of alterations," where the claims cover any way of comparing BRCA sequences such that the comparison steps can practically be performed in the human mind, _University of Utah Research Foundation v. Ambry Genetics,_ 774 F.3d 755, 763, 113 USPQ2d 1241, 1246 (Fed. Cir. 2014);
- • a claim to collecting and comparing known information (claim 1), which are steps that can be practically performed in the human mind, _Classen Immunotherapies, Inc. v. Biogen IDEC,_ 659 F.3d 1057, 1067, 100 USPQ2d 1492, 1500 (Fed. Cir. 2011); and
- • a claim to identifying head shape and applying hair designs, which is a process that can be practically performed in the human mind, _In re Brown,_ 645 Fed. App'x 1014, 1016-17 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (non-precedential).

## B.    **_A Claim That Encompasses a Human Performing the Step(s) Mentally With or Without a Physical Aid Recites a Mental Process_**

If a claim recites a limitation that can practically be performed in the human mind, with or without the use of a physical aid such as pen and paper, the limitation falls within the mental processes grouping, and the claim recites an abstract idea. See, _e.g., Benson,_ 409 U.S. at 67, 65, 175 USPQ at 674-75, 674 (noting that the claimed "conversion of [binary-coded decimal] numerals to pure binary numerals can be done mentally," _i.e.,_ "as a person would do it by head and hand."); _Synopsys,_ 839 F.3d at 1139, 120 USPQ2d at 1474 (holding that claims to the mental process of "translating a functional description of a logic circuit into a hardware component description of the logic circuit" are directed to an abstract idea, because the claims "read on an individual performing the claimed steps mentally or with pencil and paper").

The use of a physical aid (_e.g.,_ pencil and paper or a slide rule) to help perform a mental step (_e.g.,_ a mathematical calculation) does not negate the mental nature of the limitation, but simply accounts for variations in memory capacity from one person to another. For instance, in _CyberSource,_ the court determined that the step of "constructing a map of credit card numbers" was a limitation that was able to be performed "by writing down a list of credit card transactions made from a particular IP address." In making this determination, the court looked to the specification, which explained that the claimed map was nothing more than a listing of several (_e.g.,_ four) credit card transactions. The court concluded that this step was able to be performed mentally with a pen and paper, and therefore, it qualified as a mental process. 654 F.3d at 1372-73, 99 USPQ2d at 1695. See also _Flook,_ 437 U.S. at 586, 198 USPQ at 196 (claimed "computations can be made by pencil and paper calculations"); _University of Florida Research Foundation, Inc. v. General Electric Co.,_ 916 F.3d 1363, 1367, 129 USPQ2d 1409, 1411-12 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (relying on specification’s description of the claimed analysis and manipulation of data as being performed mentally "‘using pen and paper methodologies, such as flowsheets and patient charts’"); _Symantec,_ 838 F.3d at 1318, 120 USPQ2d at 1360 (although claimed as computer-implemented, steps of screening messages can be "performed by a human, mentally or with pen and paper").

## C.    **_A Claim That Requires a Computer May Still Recite a Mental Process_**

Claims can recite a mental process even if they are claimed as being performed on a computer. The Supreme Court recognized this in _Benson,_ determining that a mathematical algorithm for converting binary coded decimal to pure binary within a computer’s shift register was an abstract idea. The Court concluded that the algorithm could be performed purely mentally even though the claimed procedures "can be carried out in existing computers long in use, no new machinery being necessary." 409 U.S at 67, 175 USPQ at 675. See also _Mortgage Grader,_ 811 F.3d at 1324, 117 USPQ2d at 1699 (concluding that concept of "anonymous loan shopping" recited in a computer system claim is an abstract idea because it could be "performed by humans without a computer").

In evaluating whether a claim that requires a computer recites a mental process, examiners should carefully consider the broadest reasonable interpretation of the claim in light of the specification. For instance, examiners should review the specification to determine if the claimed invention is described as a concept that is performed in the human mind and applicant is merely claiming that concept performed 1) on a generic computer, or 2) in a computer environment, or 3) is merely using a computer as a tool to perform the concept. In these situations, the claim is considered to recite a mental process.

- 1. **Performing a mental process on a generic computer.** An example of a case identifying a mental process performed on a generic computer as an abstract idea is _Voter Verified, Inc. v. Election Systems & Software, LLC,_ 887 F.3d 1376, 1385, 126 USPQ2d 1498, 1504 (Fed. Cir. 2018). In this case, the Federal Circuit relied upon the specification in explaining that the claimed steps of voting, verifying the vote, and submitting the vote for tabulation are "human cognitive actions" that humans have performed for hundreds of years. The claims therefore recited an abstract idea, despite the fact that the claimed voting steps were performed on a computer. 887 F.3d at 1385, 126 USPQ2d at 1504. Another example is _Versata,_ in which the patentee claimed a system and method for determining a price of a product offered to a purchasing organization that was implemented using general purpose computer hardware. 793 F.3d at 1312-13, 1331, 115 USPQ2d at 1685, 1699. The Federal Circuit acknowledged that the claims were performed on a generic computer, but still described the claims as "directed to the abstract idea of determining a price, using organizational and product group hierarchies, in the same way that the claims in _Alice_ were directed to the abstract idea of intermediated settlement, and the claims in _Bilski_ were directed to the abstract idea of risk hedging." 793 F.3d at 1333; 115 USPQ2d at 1700-01.
- 2. **Performing a mental process in a computer environment.** An example of a case identifying a mental process performed in a computer environment as an abstract idea is _Symantec Corp.,_ 838 F.3d at 1316-18, 120 USPQ2d at 1360. In this case, the Federal Circuit relied upon the specification when explaining that the claimed electronic post office, which recited limitations describing how the system would receive, screen and distribute email on a computer network, was analogous to how a person decides whether to read or dispose of a particular piece of mail and that "with the exception of generic computer-implemented steps, there is nothing in the claims themselves that foreclose them from being performed by a human, mentally or with pen and paper". 838 F.3d at 1318, 120 USPQ2d at 1360. Another example is _FairWarning IP, LLC v. Iatric Sys., Inc.,_ 839 F.3d 1089, 120 USPQ2d 1293 (Fed. Cir. 2016). The patentee in _FairWarning_ claimed a system and method of detecting fraud and/or misuse in a computer environment, in which information regarding accesses of a patient’s personal health information was analyzed according to one of several rules (_i.e.,_ related to accesses in excess of a specific volume, accesses during a pre-determined time interval, or accesses by a specific user) to determine if the activity indicates improper access. 839 F.3d. at 1092, 120 USPQ2d at 1294. The court determined that these claims were directed to a mental process of detecting misuse, and that the claimed rules here were "the same questions (though perhaps phrased with different words) that humans in analogous situations detecting fraud have asked for decades, if not centuries." 839 F.3d. at 1094-95, 120 USPQ2d at 1296.
- 3. **Using a computer as a tool to perform a mental process.** An example of a case in which a computer was used as a tool to perform a mental process is _Mortgage Grader,_ 811 F.3d. at 1324, 117 USPQ2d at 1699. The patentee in _Mortgage Grader_ claimed a computer-implemented system for enabling borrowers to anonymously shop for loan packages offered by a plurality of lenders, comprising a database that stores loan package data from the lenders, and a computer system providing an interface and a grading module. The interface prompts a borrower to enter personal information, which the grading module uses to calculate the borrower’s credit grading, and allows the borrower to identify and compare loan packages in the database using the credit grading. 811 F.3d. at 1318, 117 USPQ2d at 1695. The Federal Circuit determined that these claims were directed to the concept of "anonymous loan shopping", which was a concept that could be "performed by humans without a computer." 811 F.3d. at 1324, 117 USPQ2d at 1699. Another example is _Berkheimer v. HP, Inc.,_ 881 F.3d 1360, 125 USPQ2d 1649 (Fed. Cir. 2018), in which the patentee claimed methods for parsing and evaluating data using a computer processing system. The Federal Circuit determined that these claims were directed to mental processes of parsing and comparing data, because the steps were recited at a high level of generality and merely used computers as a tool to perform the processes. 881 F.3d at 1366, 125 USPQ2d at 1652-53.

## D.    **_Both Product and Process Claims May Recite a Mental Process_**

Examiners should keep in mind that both product claims (_e.g.,_ computer system, computer-readable medium, etc.) and process claims may recite mental processes. For example, in _Mortgage Grader,_ the patentee claimed a computer-implemented system and a method for enabling borrowers to anonymously shop for loan packages offered by a plurality of lenders, comprising a database that stores loan package data from the lenders, and a computer system providing an interface and a grading module. The Federal Circuit determined that both the computer-implemented system and method claims were directed to "anonymous loan shopping", which was an abstract idea because it could be "performed by humans without a computer." 811 F.3d. at 1318, 1324-25, 117 USPQ2d at 1695, 1699-1700. See also _FairWarning IP,_ 839 F.3d at 1092, 120 USPQ2d at 1294 (identifying both system and process claims for detecting improper access of a patient's protected health information in a health-care system computer environment as directed to abstract idea of detecting fraud); _Content Extraction & Transmission LLC v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.,_ 776 F.3d 1343, 1345, 113 USPQ2d 1354, 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (system and method claims of inputting information from a hard copy document into a computer program). Accordingly, the phrase "mental processes" should be understood as referring to the type of abstract idea, and not to the statutory category of the claim.

Examples of product claims reciting mental processes include:

- • An application program interface for extracting and processing information from a diversity of types of hard copy documents – _Content Extraction,_ 776 F.3d at 1345, 113 USPQ2d at 1356;
- • A computer-implemented system for enabling anonymous loan shopping – _Mortgage Grader,_ 811 F.3d at 1318, 117 USPQ2d at 1695;
- • A computer readable medium containing program instructions for detecting fraud – _CyberSource,_ 654 F.3d at 1368 n. 1, 99 USPQ2d at 1692 n.1;
- • A post office for receiving and redistributing email messages on a computer network – _Symantec,_ 838 F.3d at 1316, 120 USPQ2d at 1359;
- • A self-verifying voting system – _Voter Verified,_ 887 F.3d at 1384-85, 126 USPQ2d at 1504;
- • A wide-area real-time performance monitoring system for monitoring and assessing dynamic stability of an electric power grid – _Electric Power Group,_ 830 F.3d at 1351 and n.1, 119 USPQ2d at 1740 and n.1; and
- • Computer readable storage media comprising computer instructions to implement a method for determining a price of a product offered to a purchasing organization – _Versata,_ 793 F.3d at 1312-13, 115 USPQ2d at 1685.

Examples of process claims reciting mental process-type abstract ideas are discussed in the preceding subsections (A) through (C). See, for example, the discussion of _Flook,_ 437 U.S. 584, 198 USPQ 193; _Benson,_ 409 U.S. 63, 175 USPQ 673; _Berkheimer,_ 881 F.3d 1360, 125 USPQ2d 1649; _Synopsys,_ 839 F.3d 1138, 120 USPQ2d 1473; and _Ambry Genetics,_ 774 F.3d 755, 113 USPQ2d 1241, _supra_.

# 2106.04(a)(3)    **Tentative Abstract Ideas** [R-10.2019]

There may be rare circumstances in which an examiner believes a claim limitation should be treated as an abstract idea even though it does not fall within any of the groupings of abstract ideas discussed in **[MPEP § 2106.04(a)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13ae3_321.html)** (i.e., mathematical concepts, certain methods of organizing human activity, mental processes). This type of claim limitation is referred to as a "tentative abstract idea."

In such circumstances, the examiner should evaluate the claim under the subject matter eligibility framework:

- • If the claim as a whole integrates the tentative abstract idea into a practical application, the claim is not directed to a judicial exception (Step 2A; NO) and thus is **eligible** at Pathway B. This concludes the eligibility analysis.
- • If the claim as a whole does not integrate the tentative abstract idea into a practical application, then the claim is directed to a judicial exception (Step 2A: YES) and thus requires further analysis at Step 2B. At Step 2B, if the claim as a whole provides an inventive concept (Step 2B: YES), the claim is **eligible** at Pathway C. This concludes the eligibility analysis.
- • If the claim as a whole does not provide an inventive concept (Step 2B: NO), the application should be brought to the attention of the Technology Center (TC) director. A rejection of a claim reciting a tentative abstract idea must be approved by the TC director (which approval will be indicated in the file record of the application) and must provide a justification for why such claim limitation is being treated as reciting an abstract idea.

The TC Director will give approval for a Step 2B subject matter eligibility rejection of a claim reciting a tentative abstract idea. The ensuing Office action will identify that the claim(s) are directed to a previously non-enumerated abstract idea via form paragraph **[7.05.017](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//fp7.05.017.html)** and include the TC Director’s signature. The TC Director will then inform Patents Management that this procedure has been used so that the public can be notified, for example, on USPTO.GOV at the Subject Matter Eligibility website.

In response to a Step 2B rejection of a claim reciting a tentative abstract idea, an interview with the examiner may be conducted, which may help advance prosecution and identify patent eligible subject matter. See **[MPEP § 713](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e84376.html)**. For applications in which an abstract idea has been identified using the tentative abstract idea procedure, an interview with the TC Director that provided approval is not necessary because the examiner retains the authority to withdraw or maintain a rejection upon consideration of applicant’s reply. The examiner is not required to obtain TC Director approval to withdraw or maintain such a **[§ 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  subject matter eligibility rejection.

# 2106.04(b)    Laws of Nature, Natural Phenomena & Products of Nature [R-10.2019]

Laws of nature and natural phenomena, as identified by the courts, include naturally occurring principles/relations and nature-based products that are naturally occurring or that do not have markedly different characteristics compared to what occurs in nature. The courts have often described these exceptions using other terms, including "physical phenomena," "scientific principles", "natural laws," and "products of nature."

## I.    **LAWS OF NATURE AND NATURAL PHENOMENA, GENERALLY**

The law of nature and natural phenomenon exceptions reflect the Supreme Court's view that the basic tools of scientific and technological work are not patentable, because the "manifestations of laws of nature" are "part of the storehouse of knowledge," "free to all men and reserved exclusively to none." _Funk Bros. Seed Co. v. Kalo Inoculant Co.,_ 333 U.S. 127, 130, 76 USPQ 280, 281 (1948). Thus, "a new mineral discovered in the earth or a new plant found in the wild is not patentable subject matter" under **[Section 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**. _Diamond v. Chakrabarty,_ 447 U.S. 303, 309, 206 USPQ 193, 197 (1980). "Likewise, Einstein could not patent his celebrated law that E=mc2; nor could Newton have patented the law of gravity." _Id._ Nor can one patent "a novel and useful mathematical formula," _Parker v. Flook,_ 437 U.S. 584, 585, 198 USPQ 193, 195 (1978); electromagnetism or steam power, _O’Reilly v. Morse,_ 56 U.S. (15 How.) 62, 113-114 (1853); or "[t]he qualities of ... bacteria, ... the heat of the sun, electricity, or the qualities of metals," _Funk,_ 333 U.S. at 130, 76 USPQ at 281; see also _Le Roy v. Tatham,_ 55 U.S. (14 How.) 156, 175 (1853).

The courts have identified the following concepts and products as examples of laws of nature or natural phenomena:

- i. isolated DNA, _Ass’n for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc.,_ 569 U.S. 576, 589-91, 106 USPQ2d 1972, 1978-79 (2013);
- ii. a cloned farm animal such as a sheep, _In re Roslin Institute (Edinburgh),_ 750 F.3d 1333, 1337, 110 USPQ2d 1668, 1671 (Fed. Cir. 2014);
- iii. a correlation between variations in non-coding regions of DNA and allele presence in coding regions of DNA, _Genetic Techs. Ltd. v. Merial LLC,_ 818 F.3d 1369, 1375, 118 USPQ2d 1541, 1545 (Fed. Cir. 2016);
- iv. a correlation that is the consequence of how a certain compound is metabolized by the body, _Mayo Collaborative Servs. v. Prometheus Labs.,_ 566 U.S. 66, 75-77, 101 USPQ2d 1961, 1967-68 (2012);
- v. a correlation between the presence of myeloperoxidase in a bodily sample (such as blood or plasma) and cardiovascular disease risk, _Cleveland Clinic Foundation v. True Health Diagnostics, LLC,_ 859 F.3d 1352, 1361, 123 USPQ2d 1081, 1087 (Fed. Cir. 2017);
- vi. electromagnetism to transmit signals, _O’Reilly v. Morse,_ 56 U.S. 62, 113 (1853);
- vii. qualities of bacteria such as their ability to create a state of inhibition or non-inhibition in other bacteria, _Funk Bros.,_ 333 U.S. at 130, 76 USPQ at 281;
- viii. single-stranded DNA fragments known as "primers", _University of Utah Research Foundation v. Ambry Genetics Corp.,_ 774 F.3d 755, 761, 113 USPQ2d 1241, 1244 (Fed. Cir. 2014);
- ix. the chemical principle underlying the union between fatty elements and water, _Tilghman v. Proctor,_ 102 U.S. 707, 729 (1880);
- x. the existence of cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in maternal blood, _Ariosa Diagnostics, Inc. v. Sequenom,_ 788 F.3d 1371, 1373, 115 USPQ2d 1152, 1153 (Fed. Cir. 2015); and
- xi. the natural relationship between a patient’s CYP2D6 metabolizer genotype and the risk that the patient will suffer QTc prolongation after administration of a medication called iloperidone, _Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. West-Ward Pharmaceuticals,_ 887 F.3d 1117, 1135-36, 126 USPQ2d 1266, 1281 (Fed. Cir. 2018).

The courts have also noted, however, that not every claim describing a natural ability or quality of a product, or describing a natural process, necessarily recites a law of nature or natural phenomenon. See _Rapid Litig. Mgmt. v. CellzDirect, Inc.,_ 827 F.3d 1042, 1048-49, 119 USPQ2d 1370, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (claims reciting process steps of fractionating, recovering, and cryopreserving hepatocytes held to be eligible, because they are not focused on merely observing or detecting the ability of hepatocytes to survive multiple freeze-thaw cycles). Thus, in a claimed method of treating cancer with chemotherapy, the cancer cells’ inability to survive chemotherapy is not considered to be a law of nature. Similarly, in a claimed method of treating headaches with aspirin, the human body’s natural response to aspirin is not considered to be a law of nature. These claims are accordingly eligible at Prong One unless they recite another exception, in which case they require further analysis in Prong Two (and Step 2B, if needed) to determine their eligibility. Similarly, a method of producing a new compound is not directed to the individual components’ ability to combine to form the new compound. _Id._ See also _Tilghman v. Proctor,_ 102 U.S. 707, 729 (1881) (claims reciting process steps for manufacturing fatty acids and glycerol by hydrolyzing fat at high temperature and pressure were held to be eligible, because they are not focused on the chemical principle that fat can be hydrolyzed into its components).

Even if a claim does recite a law of nature or natural phenomenon, it may still be eligible at any of Pathways A through C. For example, claims reciting a naturally occurring relationship between a patient’s genotype and the risk of QTc prolongation (a law of nature) were held eligible as not "directed to" that relationship because they also recited a step of treating the patient with an amount of a particular medication that was tailored to the patient’s genotype. _Vanda Pharms.,_ 887 F.3d at 1134-36, 126 USPQ2d at 1279-81. This particular treatment step applied the natural relationship in a manner that integrated it into a practical application. The court’s analysis in _Vanda_ is equivalent to a finding of eligibility at Step 2A Prong Two (Pathway B).

As explained in **[MPEP § 2106.04](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_139db_e0.html)**, a claim that recites a law of nature or a natural phenomenon requires further analysis in Step 2A Prong Two to determine whether the claim integrates the exception into a practical application.

A claim that does not recite a law of nature or natural phenomenon is eligible at Pathway B (Step 2A: NO) unless the claim recites, and is directed to, another exception (such as an abstract idea, or a product of nature).

## II.    **PRODUCTS OF NATURE**

When a law of nature or natural phenomenon is claimed as a physical product, the courts have often referred to the exception as a "product of nature". For example, the isolated DNA of _Myriad_ and the primers of _Ambry Genetics_ were described as products of nature by the courts. _Ass’n for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc.,_ 569 U.S. 576, 580, 106 USPQ2d 1972, 1975 (2013); _University of Utah Research Foundation v. Ambry Genetics,_ 774 F.3d 755, 758-59, 113 USPQ2d 1241, 1243 (Fed. Cir. 2014). As explained in those decisions, products of nature are considered to be an exception because they tie up the use of naturally occurring things, but they have been labeled as both laws of nature and natural phenomena. See _Myriad Genetics, Inc.,_ 569 U.S. at 590-91, 106 USPQ2d at 1979 (claims to isolated DNA held ineligible because they "claim naturally occurring phenomena" and are "squarely within the law of nature exception"); _Funk Bros. Seed Co. v. Kalo Inoculant Co.,_ 333 U.S. 127, 130, 76 USPQ 280, 281 (1948) (claims to bacterial mixtures held ineligible as "manifestations of laws of nature" and "phenomena of nature"). Step 2A of the Office’s eligibility analysis uses the terms "law of nature" and "natural phenomenon" as inclusive of "products of nature".

It is important to keep in mind that product of nature exceptions include both naturally occurring products and non-naturally occurring products that lack markedly different characteristics from any naturally occurring counterpart. See, _e.g.,_ _Ambry Genetics,_ 774 F.3d at 760, 113 USPQ2d at 1244 ("Contrary to _Myriad's_ argument, it makes no difference that the identified gene sequences are synthetically replicated. As the Supreme Court made clear, neither naturally occurring compositions of matter, nor synthetically created compositions that are structurally identical to the naturally occurring compositions, are patent eligible."). Thus, a synthetic, artificial, or non-naturally occurring product such as a cloned organism or a human-made hybrid plant is not automatically eligible because it was created by human ingenuity or intervention. See, _e.g.,_ _In re Roslin Institute (Edinburgh),_ 750 F.3d 1333, 1337, 110 USPQ2d 1668, 1671-72 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (cloned sheep); cf. _J.E.M. Ag Supply, Inc. v. Pioneer Hi-Bred Int’l, Inc.,_ 534 U.S. 130-132, 60 USPQ2d 1868-69 (2001) (hybrid plant). Instead, the key to the eligibility of all non-naturally occurring products is whether they possess markedly different characteristics from any naturally occurring counterpart.

When a claim recites a nature-based product limitation, examiners should use the markedly different characteristics analysis discussed in **[MPEP § 2106.04(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13bc1_b1.html)** to evaluate the nature-based product limitation and determine the answer to Step 2A. Nature-based products, as used herein, include both eligible and ineligible products and merely refer to the types of products subject to the markedly different characteristics analysis used to identify product of nature exceptions. Examples of nature-based products include the isolated gene and cDNA sequences of _Myriad,_ the cloned farm animals of _Roslin,_ and the bacterium of _Chakrabarty_. As is evident from these examples, and as further discussed in **[MPEP § 2105](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e197008.html)**, a nature-based product that is a living organism (_e.g.,_ a plant, an animal, a bacterium, etc.) is not excluded from patent protection merely because it is alive, and such a product is eligible for patenting if it satisfies the markedly different characteristics analysis.

It is important to keep in mind that under the broadest reasonable interpretation (BRI) of the claims, a nature-based product limitation may encompass both eligible and ineligible products. For example, a claim to a "cloned giraffe" may have a BRI encompassing cloned giraffes with markedly different characteristics, as well as cloned giraffes that lack markedly different characteristics and thus are products of nature. Cf. _Roslin,_ 750 F.3d at 1338-39, 110 USPQ2d at 1673 (applicant could not rely on unclaimed features to distinguish claimed mammals from donor mammals).

Such a claim recites a product of nature, and thus requires further analysis in Prong Two. If the claim is ultimately rejected as failing to encompass an inventive concept (Step 2B: NO), it is a best practice for the examiner to point out the broadest reasonable interpretation and recommend an amendment, if possible, that would narrow the claim to those embodiments that are not directed to products of nature, or that are otherwise eligible.

For claims that recite a nature-based product limitation (which may or may not be a product of nature exception) but which are directed to inventions that clearly do not seek to tie up any judicial exception, examiners should consider whether the streamlined eligibility analysis discussed in **[MPEP § 2106.06](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13e6a_88.html)** is appropriate. In such cases, it would not be necessary to conduct a markedly different characteristics analysis.

# 2106.04(c)    The Markedly Different Characteristics Analysis [R-07.2022]

The markedly different characteristics analysis is part of Step 2A Prong One, because the courts use this analysis to identify product of nature exceptions. For example, _Chakrabarty_ relied on a comparison of the claimed bacterium to naturally occurring bacteria when determining that the claimed bacterium was not a product of nature because it had "markedly different characteristics from any found in nature". _Diamond v. Chakrabarty,_ 447 U.S. 303, 310, 206 USPQ 193, 197 (1980). Similarly, _Roslin_ relied on a comparison of the claimed sheep to naturally occurring sheep when determining that the claimed sheep was a product of nature because it "does not possess ‘markedly different characteristics from any [farm animals] found in nature.’" _In re Roslin Institute (Edinburgh),_ 750 F.3d 1333, 1337, 110 USPQ2d 1668, 1671-72 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (quoting _Chakrabarty,_ 447 U.S. at 310, 206 USPQ at 197 (alterations in original)).

This section sets forth guidelines for performing the markedly different characteristics analysis, including information on when to perform the analysis, and how to perform the analysis. Examiners should consult these guidelines when performing an eligibility analysis of a claim that recites a nature-based product limitation. Nature-based products, as used herein, include both eligible and ineligible products and merely refer to the types of products subject to the markedly different characteristics analysis used to identify product of nature exceptions.

If the claim includes a nature-based product that has markedly different characteristics, then the claim does not recite a product of nature exception and is eligible (Step 2A: NO) at Pathway B unless the claim recites another exception (such as a law of nature or abstract idea, or a different natural phenomenon). For claims where the entire claim is a single nature-based product (e.g., a claim to "a _Lactobacillus_ bacterium"), once a markedly different characteristic in that product is shown, no further analysis would be necessary for eligibility because no product of nature exception is recited (i.e., Step 2B is not necessary because the answer to Step 2A is NO). For claims including limitations in addition to the nature-based product, examiners should consider whether the claim recites another exception and thus requires further eligibility analysis.

If the claim includes a nature-based product that does not exhibit markedly different characteristics from its naturally occurring counterpart in its natural state, then the claim recites a "product of nature" exception, and requires further analysis in Step 2A Prong Two to determine whether the claim as a whole integrates the exception into a practical application.

## I.    **WHEN TO PERFORM THE MARKEDLY DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS ANALYSIS**

Because a nature-based product can be claimed by itself (_e.g.,_ "a _Lactobacillus_ bacterium") or as one or more limitations of a claim (e.g., "a probiotic composition comprising a mixture of _Lactobacillus_ and milk in a container"), care should be taken not to overly extend the markedly different characteristics analysis to products that when viewed as a whole are not nature-based. Instead, the markedly different characteristics analysis should be applied only to the nature-based product limitations in the claim to determine whether the nature-based products are "product of nature" exceptions.

Examiners should keep in mind that if the nature-based product limitation is naturally occurring, there is no need to perform the markedly different characteristics analysis because the limitation is by definition directed to a naturally occurring product and thus falls under the product of nature exception. However, if the nature-based product limitation is not naturally occurring, for example due to some human intervention, then the markedly different characteristics analysis must be performed to determine whether the claimed product limitation is a product of nature exception.

## A.    **_Product Claims_**

Where the claim is to a nature-based product by itself (_e.g.,_ a claim to "a _Lactobacillus_ bacterium"), the markedly different characteristics analysis should be applied to the entire product. See, _e.g., Chakrabarty,_ 447 U.S. at 305, 309-10, 206 USPQ at 195, 197-98 (applying analysis to entire claimed "bacterium from the genus _Pseudomonas_ containing therein at least two stable energy-generating plasmids, each of said plasmids providing a separate hydrocarbon degradative pathway").

Where the claim is to a nature-based product produced by combining multiple components (_e.g.,_ a claim to "a probiotic composition comprising a mixture of _Lactobacillus_ and milk"), the markedly different characteristics analysis should be applied to the resultant nature-based combination, rather than its component parts. For instance, for the probiotic composition example, the mixture of _Lactobacillus_ and milk should be analyzed for markedly different characteristics, rather than the _Lactobacillus_ separately and the milk separately. See subsection II, below, for further guidance on the markedly different characteristic analysis.

Where the claim is to a nature-based product in combination with non-nature based elements (_e.g.,_ a claim to "a yogurt starter kit comprising _Lactobacillus_ in a container with instructions for culturing _Lactobacillus_ with milk to produce yogurt"), the markedly different characteristics analysis should be applied only to the nature-based product limitation. For instance, for the yogurt starter kit example, the _Lactobacillus_ would be analyzed for markedly different characteristics. The container and instructions would not be subject to the markedly different characteristics analysis as they are not nature-based products, but would be evaluated as additional elements in Prong Two (and Step 2B if needed) if it is determined that the _Lactobacillus_ does not have markedly different characteristics from any naturally occurring counterpart and thus is a product of nature exception. See, _e.g., Funk Bros. Seed Co. v. Kalo Inoculant Co.,_ 333 U.S. 127, 130, 76 USPQ 280, 281 (1948) (although claims 7, 8, 13 and 14 recited an inoculant comprising a bacterial mixture and a powder base, only the bacterial mixture was analyzed).

## B.    **_Product-by-Process Claims_**

For a product-by-process claim (_e.g.,_ a claim to a cloned farm animal produced by a nuclear transfer cloning method), the analysis turns on whether the nature-based product in the claim has markedly different characteristics from its naturally occurring counterpart. See **[MPEP § 2113](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e201450.html)** for more information on product-by-process claims.

## C.    **_Process Claims_**

For a process claim, the general rule is that the claim is not subject to the markedly different analysis for nature-based products used in the process. This is because the analysis of a process claim should focus on the active steps of the process rather than the products used in those steps. For example, when evaluating a claimed process of cryopreserving hepatocyte cells comprising performing density gradient fractionation to separate viable and non-viable hepatocytes, recovering the viable hepatocytes, and cryopreserving the recovered viable hepatocytes, the court did not subject the claim to the markedly different characteristics analysis for the nature-based products (the hepatocytes) used in the process. _Rapid Litig. Mgmt. v. CellzDirect, Inc.,_ 827 F.3d 1042, 1049, 119 USPQ2d 1370, 1374 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (claims are directed to a process of creating a preparation of multi-cryopreserved hepatocytes, not to the preparation itself).

However, in the limited situation where a process claim reciting a nature-based product is drafted in such a way that there is no difference in substance from a product claim, the claim is subject to the markedly different analysis for the recited nature-based product. These types of claims are drafted in a way that focuses on the product rather than the process steps. For example, consider a claim that recites, in its entirety, "a method of providing an apple." Under the broadest reasonable interpretation, this claim is focused on the apple fruit itself, which is a nature-based product. Similarly, claims to detecting naturally occurring cell-free fetal DNA (cffDNA) in maternal blood were held to be directed to the cffDNA, because the "existence and location of cffDNA is a natural phenomenon [and thus] identifying its presence was merely claiming the natural phenomena itself." _Rapid Litig. Mgmt.,_ 827 F.3d at 1048, 119 USPQ2d at 1374, (explaining the holding in _Ariosa Diagnostics, Inc. v. Sequenom,_ 788 F.3d 1371, 115 USPQ2d 1152 (Fed. Cir. 2015)).

## II.    **HOW TO PERFORM THE MARKEDLY DIFFERENT CHARACTERISTICS ANALYSIS**

The markedly different characteristics analysis compares the nature-based product limitation to its naturally occurring counterpart in its natural state. Markedly different characteristics can be expressed as the product’s structure, function, and/or other properties, and are evaluated based on what is recited in the claim on a case-by-case basis. If the analysis indicates that a nature-based product limitation does not exhibit markedly different characteristics, then that limitation is a product of nature exception. If the analysis indicates that a nature-based product limitation does have markedly different characteristics, then that limitation is not a product of nature exception.

This section sets forth guidelines for performing the markedly different characteristics analysis, including information on (a) selecting the appropriate naturally occurring counterpart(s) to the nature-based product limitation, (b) identifying appropriate characteristics for analysis, and (c) evaluating characteristics to determine whether they are "markedly different".

## A.    **_Selecting The Appropriate Counterpart(s)_**

Because the markedly different characteristics analysis compares the nature-based product limitation to its naturally occurring counterpart in its natural state, the first step in the analysis is to select the appropriate counterpart(s) to the nature-based product.

When the nature-based product is derived from a naturally occurring thing, then the naturally occurring thing is the counterpart. For example, assume that applicant claims deoxyacid A, which is a chemical derivative of a naturally occurring chemical called acid A. Because the inventor created the claimed nature-based product (deoxyacid A) by modifying the naturally occurring acid A, the closest natural counterpart for deoxyacid A would be the natural product from which it was derived, _i.e.,_ acid A. See, _e.g.,_ _Chakrabarty,_ 447 U.S. at 305 and n.1, 206 USPQ at 195 and n.1 (counterpart to genetically modified _Pseudomonas_ bacterium containing multiple plasmids is the naturally occurring unmodified _Pseudomonas_ bacterium from which the claimed bacterium was created); _Roslin,_ 750 F.3d at 1337, 110 USPQ2d at 1671-72 (counterparts to cloned sheep are naturally occurring sheep such as the donor ewe from which the clone was created).

Although the selected counterpart should be in its natural state, examiners should take care not to confuse the counterpart with other material that may occur naturally with, or adjacent to, the counterpart. For example, assume that applicant claims a nucleic acid having a nucleotide sequence derived from naturally occurring gene B. Although gene B occurs in nature as part of a chromosome, the closest natural counterpart for the claimed nucleic acid is gene B, and not the whole chromosome. See, e.g., _Ass’n for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics, Inc.,_ 569 U.S. 576, 591-94, 106 USPQ2d 1972, 1979-81 (2013) (comparing isolated BRCA1 genes and BRCA1 cDNA molecules to naturally occurring BRCA1 gene); _Roche Molecular System, Inc. v. CEPHEID,_ 905 F.3d 1363, 1371, 128 USPQ2d 1221, 1227 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (comparing claimed primers to "their corresponding nucleotide sequences on the naturally occurring DNA"). Similarly, assume that applicant claims a single-stranded piece of DNA (a primer) having a nucleotide sequence derived from the sense strand of naturally occurring nucleic acid C. Although nucleic acid C occurs in nature as a double-stranded molecule having a sense and an antisense strand, the closest natural counterpart for the claimed nucleic acid is the sense strand of C only. See, e.g., _University of Utah Research Foundation v. Ambry Genetics,_ 774 F.3d 755, 760, 113 USPQ2d 1241, 1241 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (comparing single-stranded nucleic acid to the same strand found in nature, even though "single-stranded DNA cannot be found in the human body").

When there are multiple counterparts to the nature-based product, the comparison should be made to the closest naturally occurring counterpart. For example, assume that the inventor creates a cloned sheep D by transferring nuclear DNA from a Finn-Dorset sheep into an egg cell (which contains mitochondrial DNA) from a Scottish Blackface sheep. Applicant then claims sheep D. Here, because sheep D was created via combining DNA from two different naturally occurring sheep of different breeds, there is no single closest natural counterpart. The examiner should therefore select the counterpart most closely related to sheep D based on the examiner’s expertise in the particular art. For the example discussed here, the closest counterparts might be naturally occurring Finn-Dorset or Scottish Blackface sheep, as opposed to sheep of a different breed such as Bighorn sheep. _Cf. Roslin,_ 750 F.3d at 1337, 110 USPQ2d at 1671-72 (claimed sheep produced by nuclear transfer into an oocyte and subsequent manipulation of natural embryonic development processes was compared to naturally occurring sheep such as the donor ewe from which the nuclear material was obtained). When the nature-based product is a combination produced from multiple components, the closest counterpart may be the individual nature-based components of the combination. For example, assume that applicant claims an inoculant comprising a mixture of bacteria from different species, _e.g.,_ some bacteria of species E and some bacteria of species F. Because there is no counterpart mixture in nature, the closest counterparts to the claimed mixture are the individual components of the mixture, _i.e.,_ each naturally occurring species by itself. See, e.g., _Funk Bros.,_ 333 U.S. at 130, 76 USPQ at 281 (comparing claimed mixture of bacterial species to each species as it occurs in nature); _Ambry Genetics,_ 774 F.3d at 760, 113 USPQ2d at 1244 (although claimed as a pair, individual primer molecules were compared to corresponding segments of naturally occurring gene sequence); _In re Bhagat,_ 726 Fed. Appx. 772, 778-79 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (non-precedential) (comparing claimed mixture of lipids with particular lipid profile to "naturally occurring lipid profiles of walnut oil and olive oil"). See subsection II.C.

If the claim is rejected as ineligible, it is a "best practice" for the examiner to identify the selected counterpart in the Office action if the record is not already clear. This practice assists the applicant in responding, and clarifies the record as to how the examiner is interpreting the claim.

## B.    **_Identifying Appropriate Characteristics For Analysis_**

Because the markedly different characteristics analysis is based on comparing the characteristics of the claimed nature-based product and its counterpart, the second step in the analysis is to identify appropriate characteristics to compare.

Appropriate characteristics must be possessed by the claimed product, because it is the claim that must define the invention to be patented. _Cf. Roslin,_ 750 F.3d at 1338, 110 USPQ2d at 1673 (unclaimed characteristics could not contribute to eligibility). Examiners can identify the characteristics possessed by the claimed product by looking at what is recited in the claim language and encompassed within the broadest reasonable interpretation of the nature-based product. In some claims, a characteristic may be explicitly recited. For example, in a claim to "deoxyribose", the recited chemical name informs those in the art of the structural characteristics of the product (_i.e.,_ the "deoxy" prefix indicates that a hydroxyl group has been removed as compared to ribose). In other claims, the characteristic may be apparent from the broadest reasonable interpretation even though it is not explicitly recited in the claim. For example, in a claim to "isolated gene B," the examiner would need to rely on the broadest reasonable interpretation of "isolated gene B" to determine what characteristics the isolated gene has, _e.g.,_ what its nucleotide sequence is, and what, if any, protein it encodes.

Appropriate characteristics can be expressed as the nature-based product’s structure, function, and/or other properties, and are evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Non-limiting examples of the types of characteristics considered by the courts when determining whether there is a marked difference include:

- • Biological or pharmacological functions or activities;
- • Chemical and physical properties;
- • Phenotype, including functional and structural characteristics; and
- • Structure and form, whether chemical, genetic or physical.

Examples of biological or pharmacological functions or activities include, but are not limited to:

- i. the protein-encoding information of a nucleic acid, _Myriad,_ 569 U.S. at 590-91, 106 USPQ2d at 1979;
- ii. the ability of complementary nucleotide sequences to bind to each other, _Ambry Genetics,_ 774 F.3d at 760-61, 113 USPQ2d at 1244;
- iii. the properties and functions of bacteria such as the ability to infect certain leguminous plants, _Funk Bros.,_ 333 U.S. at 130-31, 76 USPQ2d at 281-82;
- iv. the ability to degrade certain hydrocarbons, _Diamond v. Chakrabarty,_ 447 U.S. at 310, 206 USPQ2d at 195; and
- v. the ability of vitamin C to prevent and treat scurvy, _In re King,_ 107 F.2d 618, 27 CCPA 754, 756-57, 43 USPQ 400, 401-402 (CCPA 1939).

Examples of chemical and physical properties include, but are not limited to:

- i. the alkalinity of a chemical compound, _Parke-Davis & Co. v. H.K. Mulford Co.,_ 189 F. 95, 103-04 (S.D.N.Y. 1911); and
- ii. the ductility or malleability of metals, _In re Marden,_ 47 F.2d 958, 959, 18 CCPA 1057, 1059, 8 USPQ 347, 349 (CCPA 1931).

Examples of phenotypic characteristics include, but are not limited to:

- i. functional and structural characteristics such as the shape, size, color, and behavior of an organism, _Roslin,_ 750 F.3d at 1338, 110 USPQ2d at 1672.

Examples of structure and form include, but are not limited to:

- i. physical structure or form such as the physical presence of plasmids in a bacterial cell, _Chakrabarty,_ 447 U.S. at 305 and n.1, 206 USPQ2d at 195 and n.1;
- ii. chemical structure and form such as a chemical being a "nonsalt" and a "crystalline substance", _Parke-Davis,_ 189 F. at 100, 103;
- iii. genetic structure such as the nucleotide sequence of DNA, _Myriad,_ 569 U.S. at 590, 594-95, 106 USPQ2d at 1979, 1981; and
- iv. the genetic makeup (genotype) of a cell or organism, _Roslin,_ 750 F.3d at 1338-39, 110 USPQ2d at 1672-73.

## C.    **_Evaluating Characteristics To Determine Whether They Are "Markedly Different"_**

The final step in the markedly different characteristics analysis is to compare the characteristics of the claimed nature-based product to its naturally occurring counterpart in its natural state, in order to determine whether the characteristics of the claimed product are markedly different. The courts have emphasized that to show a marked difference, a characteristic must be changed as compared to nature, and cannot be an inherent or innate characteristic of the naturally occurring counterpart or an incidental change in a characteristic of the naturally occurring counterpart. _Myriad,_ 569 U.S. at 580, 106 USPQ2d at 1974-75. Thus, in order to be markedly different, the inventor must have caused the claimed product to possess at least one characteristic that is different from that of the counterpart.

If there is no change in any characteristic, the claimed product lacks markedly different characteristics, and is a product of nature exception. If there is a change in at least one characteristic as compared to the counterpart, and the change came about or was produced by the inventor’s efforts or influences, then the change will generally be considered a markedly different characteristic such that the claimed product is not a product of nature exception.

## 1.    **Examples of Products Having Markedly Different Characteristics**

In _Chakrabarty,_ the Supreme Court identified a claimed bacterium as a nature-based product having markedly different characteristics. This bacterium had a changed functional characteristic, _i.e.,_ it was able to degrade at least two different hydrocarbons as compared to naturally occurring _Pseudomonas_ bacteria that can only degrade a single hydrocarbon. The claimed bacterium also had a different structural characteristic, _i.e.,_ it was genetically modified to include more plasmids than are found in a single naturally occurring _Pseudomonas_ bacterium. The Supreme Court considered these changed characteristics to be "markedly different characteristics from any found in nature" due to the additional plasmids and resultant capacity for degrading multiple hydrocarbon components of oil. Therefore, the bacterium was eligible. _Diamond v. Chakrabarty_, 447 U.S. 303, 310, 206 USPQ 193, 197 (1980).

In _Myriad,_ the Supreme Court identified a claimed full-length complementary DNA (cDNA) of the BRCA1 gene as a nature-based product having markedly different characteristics. This claimed cDNA had the same functional characteristics (i.e., it encoded the same protein) as the naturally occurring gene, but had a changed structural characteristic, _i.e.,_ a different nucleotide sequence containing only exons, as compared to the naturally occurring sequence containing both exons and introns. The Supreme Court concluded that the "cDNA retains the naturally occurring exons of DNA, but it is distinct from the DNA from which it was derived. As a result, [this] cDNA is not a ‘product of nature’" and is eligible. _Myriad,_ 569 U.S. at 595, 106 USPQ2d at 1981.

## 2.    **Examples of Products Lacking Markedly Different Characteristics**

In _Myriad,_ the Supreme Court made clear that not all changes in characteristics will rise to the level of a marked difference, _e.g.,_ the incidental changes resulting from isolation of a gene sequence are not enough to make the isolated gene markedly different. _Myriad,_ 569 U.S. at 580, 106 USPQ2d at 1974-75. The patentee in _Myriad_ had discovered the location of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in the human genome, and isolated them, _i.e.,_ separated those specific genes from the rest of the chromosome on which they exist in nature. As a result of their isolation, the isolated genes had a different structural characteristic than the natural genes, _i.e._, the natural genes had covalent bonds on their ends that connected them to the rest of the chromosome, but the isolated genes lacked these bonds. However, the claimed genes were otherwise structurally identical to the natural genes, _e.g.,_ they had the same genetic structure and nucleotide sequence as the BRCA genes in nature. The Supreme Court concluded that these isolated but otherwise unchanged genes were not eligible, because they were not different enough from what exists in nature to avoid improperly tying up the future use and study of the naturally occurring BRCA genes. _See, e.g., Myriad,_ 569 U.S. at 585, 106 USPQ2d at 1977 ("Myriad's patents would, if valid, give it the exclusive right to isolate an individual’s BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes … But isolation is necessary to conduct genetic testing") and 569 U.S. at 593, 106 USPQ2d at 1980 (describing how would-be infringers could not avoid the scope of Myriad’s claims). In sum, the claimed genes were different, but not markedly different, from their naturally occurring counterparts (the BRCA genes), and thus were product of nature exceptions.

In _Ambry Genetics,_ the court identified claimed DNA fragments known as "primers" as products of nature, because they lacked markedly different characteristics. _University of Utah Research Foundation v. Ambry Genetics Corp.,_ 774 F.3d 755, 113 USPQ2d 1241 (Fed. Cir. 2014). The claimed primers were single-stranded pieces of DNA, each of which corresponded to a naturally occurring double-stranded DNA sequence in or near the BRCA genes. The patentee argued that these primers had markedly different structural characteristics from the natural DNA, because the primers were synthetically created and because "single-stranded DNA cannot be found in the human body". The court disagreed, concluding that the primers’ structural characteristics were not markedly different than the corresponding strands of DNA in nature, because the primers and their counterparts had the same genetic structure and nucleotide sequence. 774 F.3d at 760, 113 USPQ2d at 1243-44. The patentee also argued that the primers had a different function than when they are part of the DNA strand because when isolated as a primer, a primer can be used as a starting material for a DNA polymerization process. The court disagreed, because this ability to serve as a starting material is innate to DNA itself, and was not created or altered by the patentee:

> In fact, the naturally occurring genetic sequences at issue here do not perform a significantly new function. Rather, the naturally occurring material is used to form the first step in a chain reaction--a function that is performed because the primer maintains the exact same nucleotide sequence as the relevant portion of the naturally occurring sequence. One of the primary functions of DNA’s structure in nature is that complementary nucleotide sequences bind to each other. It is this same function that is exploited here--the primer binds to its complementary nucleotide sequence. Thus, just as in nature, primers utilize the innate ability of DNA to bind to itself.

_Ambry Genetics,_ 774 F.3d at 760-61, 113 USPQ2d at 1244. In sum, because the characteristics of the claimed primers were innate to naturally occurring DNA, they lacked markedly different characteristics from nature and were thus product of nature exceptions. A similar result was reached in _Marden,_ where the court held a claim to ductile vanadium ineligible, because the "ductility or malleability of vanadium is . . . one of its inherent characteristics and not a characteristic given to it by virtue of a new combination with other materials or which characteristic is brought about by some chemical reaction or agency which changes its inherent characteristics". _In re Marden,_ 47 F.2d 958, 959, 18 CCPA 1057, 1060, 8 USPQ 347, 349 (CCPA 1931).

In _Roslin,_ the court concluded that claimed clones of farm animals were products of nature, because they lacked markedly different characteristics from the counterpart farm animals found in nature. _In re Roslin Institute (Edinburgh),_ 750 F.3d 1333, 1337, 110 USPQ2d 1668, 1671 (Fed. Cir. 2014). The inventor created its clones (which included the famous cloned sheep named Dolly) by transferring the genetic material of a donor into an oocyte (egg cell), letting the oocyte develop into an embryo, and then implanting the embryo into a surrogate animal where it developed into a baby animal. The applicant argued that the clones, including Dolly, were eligible because they were created via human ingenuity, and had phenotypic differences such as shape, size and behavior compared to their donors. The court was unpersuaded, explaining that the clones were exact genetic replicas of the donors and thus did not possess markedly different characteristics. 750 F.3d at 1337, 110 USPQ2d at 1671-72 ("Roslin’s chief innovation was the preservation of the donor DNA such that the clone is an exact copy of the mammal from which the somatic cell was taken. Such a copy is not eligible for patent protection."). The court noted that the alleged phenotypic differences (_e.g.,_ the fact that Dolly may have been taller or heavier than her donor) could not make the clones markedly different because these differences were not claimed. 750 F.3d at 1338, 110 USPQ2d at 1672. See also _Roche Molecular System, Inc. v. CEPHEID,_ 905 F.3d 1363, 1370, 128 USPQ2d 1221, 1226 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (alleged structural differences between linear primers and their counterparts on a circular chromosome were neither claimed nor relevant to the eligibility inquiry).

# 2106.04(d)    Integration of a Judicial Exception Into A Practical Application [R-07.2022]

The Supreme Court has long distinguished between principles themselves (which are not patent eligible) and the integration of those principles into practical applications (which are patent eligible). See, _e.g., Mayo Collaborative Servs. v. Prometheus Labs., Inc.,_ 566 U.S. 66, 80, 84, 101 USPQ2d 1961, 1968-69, 1970 (2012) (noting that the Court in _Diamond v. Diehr_ found ‘‘the overall process patent eligible because of the way the additional steps of the process integrated the equation into the process as a whole,’’ but the Court in _Gottschalk v. Benson_ ‘‘held that simply implementing a mathematical principle on a physical machine, namely a computer, was not a patentable application of that principle’’). Similarly, in a growing body of decisions, the Federal Circuit has distinguished between claims that are ‘‘directed to’’ a judicial exception (which require further analysis to determine their eligibility) and those that are not (which are therefore patent eligible), _e.g.,_ claims that improve the functioning of a computer or other technology or technological field. See _Diamond v. Diehr,_ 450 U.S. 175, 209 USPQ 1 (1981); _Gottschalk v. Benson,_ 409 U.S. 63, 175 USPQ 673 (1972). See, e.g., **[MPEP § 2106.06(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13ecb_2ce.html)** (summarizing _Enfish, LLC v. Microsoft Corp.,_ 822 F.3d 1327, 118 USPQ2d 1684 (Fed. Cir. 2016), _McRO, Inc. v. Bandai Namco Games Am. Inc.,_ 837 F.3d 1299, 120 USPQ2d 1091 (Fed. Cir. 2016), and other cases that were eligible as improvements to technology or computer functionality instead of being directed to abstract ideas).

Accordingly, after determining that a claim recites a judicial exception in Step 2A Prong One, examiners should evaluate whether the claim as a whole integrates the recited judicial exception into a practical application of the exception in Step 2A Prong Two. A claim that integrates a judicial exception into a practical application will apply, rely on, or use the judicial exception in a manner that imposes a meaningful limit on the judicial exception, such that the claim is more than a drafting effort designed to monopolize the judicial exception. Whether or not a claim integrates a judicial exception into a practical application is evaluated using the considerations set forth in subsection I below, in accordance with the procedure described below in subsection II.

In the context of the flowchart in **[MPEP § 2106](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e197244.html)**, subsection III, Step 2A Prong Two determines whether:

- • The claim as a whole integrates the judicial exception into a practical application, in which case the claim is not directed to a judicial exception (Step 2A: NO) and is eligible at Pathway B. This concludes the eligibility analysis.
- • The claim as a whole does not integrate the exception into a practical application, in which case the claim is directed to the judicial exception (Step 2A: YES), and requires further analysis under Step 2B (where it may still be eligible if it amounts to an inventive concept). See **[MPEP § 2106.05](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13c11_1cb.html)** for discussion of Step 2B.

## I.    **RELEVANT CONSIDERATIONS FOR EVALUATING WHETHER ADDITIONAL ELEMENTS INTEGRATE A JUDICIAL EXCEPTION INTO A PRACTICAL APPLICATION**

The Supreme Court and Federal Circuit have identified a number of considerations as relevant to the evaluation of whether the claimed additional elements demonstrate that a claim is directed to patent-eligible subject matter. The list of considerations here is not intended to be exclusive or limiting. Additional elements can often be analyzed based on more than one type of consideration and the type of consideration is of no import to the eligibility analysis. Additional discussion of these considerations, and how they were applied in particular judicial decisions, is provided in **[MPEP § 2106.05(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13c69_10.html)** through **[(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13cfb_2e.html)** and **[MPEP § 2106.05(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13d61_1a8.html)** through **[(h)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13e1a_22c.html)**.

Limitations the courts have found indicative that an additional element (or combination of elements) may have integrated the exception into a practical application include:

- • An improvement in the functioning of a computer, or an improvement to other technology or technical field, as discussed in **[MPEP §§ 2106.04(d)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d2e7df_24a6e_1bd.html)** and **[2106.05(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13c69_10.html)**;
- • Applying or using a judicial exception to effect a particular treatment or prophylaxis for a disease or medical condition, as discussed in **[MPEP § 2106.04(d)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d2e827_17196_6c.html)**;
- • Implementing a judicial exception with, or using a judicial exception in conjunction with, a particular machine or manufacture that is integral to the claim, as discussed in **[MPEP § 2106.05(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13ccf_18c.html)**;
- • Effecting a transformation or reduction of a particular article to a different state or thing, as discussed in **[MPEP § 2106.05(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13cfb_2e.html)**; and
- • Applying or using the judicial exception in some other meaningful way beyond generally linking the use of the judicial exception to a particular technological environment, such that the claim as a whole is more than a drafting effort designed to monopolize the exception, as discussed in **[MPEP § 2106.05(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13d61_1a8.html)**.

The courts have also identified limitations that did not integrate a judicial exception into a practical application:

- • Merely reciting the words "apply it" (or an equivalent) with the judicial exception, or merely including instructions to implement an abstract idea on a computer, or merely using a computer as a tool to perform an abstract idea, as discussed in **[MPEP § 2106.05(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13da8_a5.html)**;
- • Adding insignificant extra-solution activity to the judicial exception, as discussed in **[MPEP § 2106.05(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13df8_3d4.html)**; and
- • Generally linking the use of a judicial exception to a particular technological environment or field of use, as discussed in **[MPEP § 2106.05(h)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13e1a_22c.html)**.

Step 2A Prong Two is similar to Step 2B in that both analyses involve evaluating a set of judicial considerations to determine if the claim is eligible. See **[MPEP §§ 2106.05(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13c69_10.html)** through **[(h)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13e1a_22c.html)** for the list of considerations that are evaluated at Step 2B. Although most of these considerations overlap (i.e., they are evaluated in both Step 2A Prong Two and Step 2B), Step 2A specifically excludes consideration of whether the additional elements represent well-understood, routine, conventional activity. Accordingly, in Step 2A Prong Two, examiners should ensure that they give weight to all additional elements, whether or not they are conventional, when evaluating whether a judicial exception has been integrated into a practical application. Additional elements that represent well-understood, routine, conventional activity may integrate a recited judicial exception into a practical application.

It is notable that mere physicality or tangibility of an additional element or elements is not a relevant consideration in Step 2A Prong Two. As the Supreme Court explained in _Alice Corp.,_ mere physical or tangible implementation of an exception does not guarantee eligibility. _Alice Corp. Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank Int’l,_ 573 U.S. 208, 224, 110 USPQ2d 1976, 1983-84 (2014) ("The fact that a computer ‘necessarily exist[s] in the physical, rather than purely conceptual, realm,’ is beside the point"). See also _Genetic Technologies Ltd. v. Merial LLC,_ 818 F.3d 1369, 1377, 118 USPQ2d 1541, 1547 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (steps of DNA amplification and analysis are not "sufficient" to render claim 1 patent eligible merely because they are physical steps). Conversely, the presence of a non-physical or intangible additional element does not doom the claims, because tangibility is not necessary for eligibility under the _Alice/Mayo_ test. _Enfish, LLC v. Microsoft Corp.,_ 822 F.3d 1327, 118 USPQ2d 1684 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("that the improvement is not defined by reference to ‘physical’ components does not doom the claims"). See also _McRO, Inc. v. Bandai Namco Games Am. Inc.,_ 837 F.3d 1299, 1315, 120 USPQ2d 1091, 1102 (Fed. Cir. 2016), (holding that a process producing an intangible result (a sequence of synchronized, animated characters) was eligible because it improved an existing technological process).

In addition, a specific way of achieving a result is not a stand-alone consideration in Step 2A Prong Two. However, the specificity of the claim limitations is relevant to the evaluation of several considerations including the use of a particular machine, particular transformation and whether the limitations are mere instructions to apply an exception. See **[MPEP §§ 2106.05(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13ccf_18c.html)**, **[2106.05(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13cfb_2e.html)**, and **[2106.05(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13da8_a5.html)**. For example, in _Parker v. Flook,_ 437 U.S. 584, 198 USPQ 193 (1978), the Supreme Court noted that the "patent application does not purport to explain how to select the appropriate margin of safety, the weighting factor, or any of the other variables" in the claimed mathematical formula, "[n]or does it purport to contain any disclosure relating to the chemical processes at work, the monitoring of process variables, or the means of setting off an alarm or adjusting an alarm system." 437 U.S. at 586, 198 USPQ at 195. The Court found this failure to explain any specifics of how to use the claimed formula informative when deciding that the additional elements in the claim were insignificant post-solution activity and thus not meaningful enough to render the claim eligible. 437 U.S. at 589-90, 198 USPQ at 197.

## II.    **HOW TO EVALUATE WHETHER THE ADDITIONAL ELEMENTS INTEGRATE THE JUDICIAL EXCEPTION INTO A PRACTICAL APPLICATION**

The analysis under Step 2A Prong Two is the same for all claims reciting a judicial exception, whether the exception is an abstract idea, a law of nature, or a natural phenomenon (including products of nature). Examiners evaluate integration into a practical application by: (1) identifying whether there are any additional elements recited in the claim beyond the judicial exception(s); and (2) evaluating those additional elements individually and in combination to determine whether they integrate the exception into a practical application, using one or more of the considerations introduced in subsection I supra, and discussed in more detail in **[MPEP §§ 2106.04(d)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d2e7df_24a6e_1bd.html)**, **[2106.04(d)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d2e827_17196_6c.html)**, **[2106.05(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13c69_10.html)** through **[(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13cfb_2e.html)** and **[2106.05(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13d61_1a8.html)** through **[(h)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13e1a_22c.html)**.

Many of these considerations overlap, and often more than one consideration is relevant to analysis of an additional element. Not all considerations will be relevant to every element, or every claim. Because the evaluation in Prong Two is not a weighing test, it is not important how the elements are characterized or how many considerations apply from the list. It is important to evaluate the significance of the additional elements relative to the invention, and to keep in mind the ultimate question of whether the exception is integrated into a practical application. If the claim as a whole integrates the judicial exception into a practical application based upon evaluation of these considerations, the additional limitations impose a meaningful limit on the judicial exception and the claim is eligible at Step 2A.

Examiners should examine each claim for eligibility separately, based on the particular elements recited therein. Claims should not be judged to automatically stand or fall with similar claims in an application. For instance, one claim may be ineligible because it is directed to a judicial exception without amounting to significantly more, but another claim dependent on the first may be eligible because it recites additional elements that do amount to significantly more, or that integrate the exception into a practical application.

For more information on how to evaluate claims reciting multiple judicial exceptions, see **[MPEP § 2106.04](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_139db_e0.html)**, subsection II.B.

## III.    **EXAMPLES OF HOW THE OFFICE EVALUATES WHETHER THE CLAIM AS A WHOLE INTEGRATES THE JUDICIAL EXCEPTION INTO A PRACTICAL APPLICATION**

The Prong Two analysis considers the claim as a whole. That is, the limitations containing the judicial exception as well as the additional elements in the claim besides the judicial exception need to be evaluated together to determine whether the claim integrates the judicial exception into a practical application. Because a judicial exception alone is not eligible subject matter, if there are no additional claim elements besides the judicial exception, or if the additional claim elements merely recite another judicial exception, that is insufficient to integrate the judicial exception into a practical application. However, the way in which the additional elements use or interact with the exception may integrate it into a practical application. Accordingly, the additional limitations should not be evaluated in a vacuum, completely separate from the recited judicial exception. Instead, the analysis should take into consideration all the claim limitations and how those limitations interact and impact each other when evaluating whether the exception is integrated into a practical application.

Two examples of how the Office evaluates whether the claim as a whole integrates the recited judicial exception into a practical application are provided. In _Solutran, Inc. v. Elavon, Inc.,_ 931 F.3d 1161, 2019 USPQ2d 281076 (Fed. Cir. 2019), the claims were to methods for electronically processing paper checks, all of which contained limitations setting forth receiving merchant transaction data from a merchant, crediting a merchant’s account, and receiving and scanning paper checks after the merchant’s account is credited. In part one of the _Alice/Mayo_ test, the Federal Circuit determined that the claims were directed to the abstract idea of crediting the merchant’s account before the paper check is scanned. The court first determined that the recited limitations of "crediting a merchant’s account as early as possible while electronically processing a check" is a "long-standing commercial practice" like in _Alice_ and _Bilski_. 931 F.3d at 1167, 2019 USPQ2d 281076, at *5 (Fed. Cir. 2019). The Federal Circuit then continued with its analysis under part one of the _Alice/Mayo_ test finding that the claims are not directed to an improvement in the functioning of a computer or an improvement to another technology. In particular, the court determined that the claims "did not improve the technical capture of information from a check to create a digital file or the technical step of electronically crediting a bank account" nor did the claims "improve how a check is scanned." _Id._ This analysis is equivalent to the Office’s analysis of determining that the exception is not integrated into a practical application at Step 2A Prong Two, and thus that the claims are directed to the judicial exception (Step 2A: YES).

In _Finjan Inc. v. Blue Coat Systems, Inc.,_ 879 F.3d 1299, 125 USPQ2d 1282 (Fed. Cir. 2018), the claimed invention was a method of virus scanning that scans an application program, generates a security profile identifying any potentially suspicious code in the program, and links the security profile to the application program. 879 F.3d at 1303-04, 125 USPQ2d at 1285-86. The Federal Circuit noted that the recited virus screening was an abstract idea, and that merely performing virus screening on a computer does not render the claim eligible. 879 F.3d at 1304, 125 USPQ2d at 1286. The court then continued with its analysis under part one of the _Alice/Mayo_ test by reviewing the patent’s specification, which described the claimed security profile as identifying both hostile and potentially hostile operations. The court noted that the security profile thus enables the invention to protect the user against both previously unknown viruses and "obfuscated code," as compared to traditional virus scanning, which only recognized the presence of previously-identified viruses. The security profile also enables more flexible virus filtering and greater user customization. 879 F.3d at 1304, 125 USPQ2d at 1286. The court identified these benefits as improving computer functionality, and verified that the claims recite additional elements (_e.g.,_ specific steps of using the security profile in a particular way) that reflect this improvement. Accordingly, the court held the claims eligible as not being directed to the recited abstract idea. 879 F.3d at 1304-05, 125 USPQ2d at 1286-87. This analysis is equivalent to the Office’s analysis of determining that the additional elements integrate the judicial exception into a practical application at Step 2A Prong Two, and thus that the claims were not directed to the judicial exception (Step 2A: NO).

# 2106.04(d)(1)    Evaluating Improvements in the Functioning of a Computer, or an Improvement to Any Other Technology or Technical Field in Step 2A Prong Two [R-10.2019]

A claim reciting a judicial exception is not directed to the judicial exception if it also recites additional elements demonstrating that the claim as a whole integrates the exception into a practical application. One way to demonstrate such integration is when the claimed invention improves the functioning of a computer or improves another technology or technical field. The application or use of the judicial exception in this manner meaningfully limits the claim by going beyond generally linking the use of the judicial exception to a particular technological environment, and thus transforms a claim into patent-eligible subject matter. Such claims are eligible at Step 2A because they are not "directed to" the recited judicial exception.

The courts have not provided an explicit test for this consideration, but have instead illustrated how it is evaluated in numerous decisions. These decisions, and a detailed explanation of how examiners should evaluate this consideration are provided in **[MPEP § 2106.05(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13c69_10.html)**. In short, first the specification should be evaluated to determine if the disclosure provides sufficient details such that one of ordinary skill in the art would recognize the claimed invention as providing an improvement. The specification need not explicitly set forth the improvement, but it must describe the invention such that the improvement would be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art. Conversely, if the specification explicitly sets forth an improvement but in a conclusory manner (_i.e.,_ a bare assertion of an improvement without the detail necessary to be apparent to a person of ordinary skill in the art), the examiner should not determine the claim improves technology. Second, if the specification sets forth an improvement in technology, the claim must be evaluated to ensure that the claim itself reflects the disclosed improvement. That is, the claim includes the components or steps of the invention that provide the improvement described in the specification. The claim itself does not need to explicitly recite the improvement described in the specification (_e.g.,_ "thereby increasing the bandwidth of the channel").

While the courts usually evaluate "improvements" as part of the "directed to" inquiry in part one of the _Alice/Mayo_ test (equivalent to Step 2A), they have also performed this evaluation in part two of the _Alice/Mayo_ test (equivalent to Step 2B). See, _e.g., BASCOM Global Internet v. AT&T Mobility LLC,_ 827 F.3d 1341, 1349-50, 119 USPQ2d 1236, 1241-42 (Fed. Cir. 2016). However, the improvement analysis at Step 2A Prong Two differs in some respects from the improvements analysis at Step 2B. Specifically, the "improvements" analysis in Step 2A determines whether the claim pertains to an improvement to the functioning of a computer or to another technology without reference to what is well-understood, routine, conventional activity. That is, the claimed invention may integrate the judicial exception into a practical application by demonstrating that it improves the relevant existing technology although it may not be an improvement over well-understood, routine, conventional activity. It should be noted that while this consideration is often referred to in an abbreviated manner as the "improvements consideration," the word "improvements" in the context of this consideration is limited to improvements to the functioning of a computer or any other technology/technical field, whether in Step 2A Prong Two or in Step 2B.

Examples of claims that improve technology and are not directed to a judicial exception include: _Enfish, LLC v. Microsoft Corp.,_ 822 F.3d 1327, 1339, 118 USPQ2d 1684, 1691-92 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (claims to a self-referential table for a computer database were directed to an improvement in computer capabilities and not directed to an abstract idea); _McRO, Inc. v. Bandai Namco Games Am. Inc.,_ 837 F.3d 1299, 1315, 120 USPQ2d 1091, 1102-03 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (claims to automatic lip synchronization and facial expression animation were directed to an improvement in computer-related technology and not directed to an abstract idea); _Visual Memory LLC v. NVIDIA Corp.,_ 867 F.3d 1253,1259-60, 123 USPQ2d 1712, 1717 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (claims to an enhanced computer memory system were directed to an improvement in computer capabilities and not an abstract idea); _Finjan Inc. v. Blue Coat Systems, Inc.,_ 879 F.3d 1299, 125 USPQ2d 1282 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (claims to virus scanning were found to be an improvement in computer technology and not directed to an abstract idea); _SRI Int’l, Inc. v. Cisco Systems, Inc.,_ 930 F.3d 1295, 1303 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (claims to detecting suspicious activity by using network monitors and analyzing network packets were found to be an improvement in computer network technology and not directed to an abstract idea). Additional examples are provided in **[MPEP § 2106.05(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13c69_10.html)**.

# 2106.04(d)(2)    Particular Treatment and Prophylaxis in Step 2A Prong Two [R-07.2022]

A claim reciting a judicial exception is not directed to the judicial exception if it also recites additional element(s) demonstrating that the claim as a whole integrates the exception into a practical application. One way to demonstrate such integration is when the additional elements apply or use the recited judicial exception to effect a particular treatment or prophylaxis for a disease or medical condition. The application or use of the judicial exception in this manner meaningfully limits the claim by going beyond generally linking the use of the judicial exception to a particular technological environment, and thus transforms a claim into patent-eligible subject matter. Such claims are eligible at Step 2A, because they are not "directed to" the recited judicial exception.

The particular treatment or prophylaxis consideration originated as part of the other meaningful limitations consideration discussed in **[MPEP § 2106.05(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13d61_1a8.html)** and shares the same legal basis in Supreme Court jurisprudence as that consideration. However, recent jurisprudence has provided additional guidance that is especially relevant to only a subset of claims, thus warranting the elevation of the particular treatment or prophylaxis consideration to become a stand-alone consideration in the Step 2A Prong Two analysis. _Vanda Pharm. Inc. v. West-Ward Pharm. Int’l Ltd.,_ 887 F.3d 1117, 126 USPQ2d 1266 (Fed. Cir. 2018). The claims in _Vanda_ recited a method of treating a patient having schizophrenia with iloperidone, a drug known to cause QTc prolongation (a disruption of the heart’s normal rhythm that can lead to serious health problems) in patients having a particular genotype associated with poor drug metabolism. 887 F.3d at 1121, 126 USPQ2d at 1269-70. In particular, the claims recited steps of: (1) performing a genotyping assay to determine if a patient has a genotype associated with poor drug metabolism; and (2) administering iloperidone to the patient in a dose range that depends on the patient’s genotype. _Id._ Although _Vanda’s_ claims recited a law of nature (the naturally occurring relationship between the patient’s genotype and the risk of QTc prolongation) like the claims in _Mayo Collaborative Servs. v. Prometheus Labs., Inc.,_ 566 U.S. 66, 101 USPQ2d 1961 (2012), the Federal Circuit distinguished them from the _Mayo_ claims based on the differences in the administration steps. In particular, the court explained that _Mayo’s_ step of administering a drug to a patient was performed in order to gather data about the recited laws of nature, and this step was thus ancillary to the overall diagnostic focus of the claims. 887 F.3d at 1134-35, 126 USPQ2d at 1280. In contrast, _Vanda’s_ claims used the recited law of nature to more safely treat the patients with the drug, thereby reducing the patient’s risk of QTc prolongation. 887 F.3d at 1135, 126 USPQ2d at 1280. Accordingly, the court held _Vanda’s_ claims eligible at the first part of the _Alice/Mayo_ test (Step 2A) because the claims were not "directed to" the recited judicial exception. 887 F.3d at 1136, 126 USPQ2d at 1281.

Examples of "treatment" and prophylaxis" limitations encompass limitations that treat or prevent a disease or medical condition, including, e.g., acupuncture, administration of medication, dialysis, organ transplants, phototherapy, physiotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, and the like. For example, an immunization step that integrates an abstract idea into a specific process of immunizing that lowers the risk that immunized patients will later develop chronic immune-mediated diseases is considered to be a particular prophylaxis limitation that practically applies the abstract idea. See, _e.g., Classen Immunotherapies, Inc. v. Biogen IDEC,_ 659 F.3d 1057, 1066–68, 100 USPQ2d 1492, 1500-01 (Fed. Cir. 2011).

Examiners should keep in mind that in order to qualify as a "treatment" or "prophylaxis" limitation for purposes of this consideration, the claim limitation in question must affirmatively recite an action that effects a particular treatment or prophylaxis for a disease or medical condition. An example of such a limitation is a step of "administering amazonic acid to a patient" or a step of "administering a course of plasmapheresis to a patient." If the limitation does not actually provide a treatment or prophylaxis, _e.g.,_ it is merely an intended use of the claimed invention or a field of use limitation, then it cannot integrate a judicial exception under the "treatment or prophylaxis" consideration. For example, a step of "prescribing a topical steroid to a patient with eczema" is not a positive limitation because it does not require that the steroid actually be used by or on the patient, and a recitation that a claimed product is a "pharmaceutical composition" or that a "feed dispenser is operable to dispense a mineral supplement" are not affirmative limitations because they are merely indicating how the claimed invention might be used.

When determining whether a claim applies or uses a recited judicial exception to effect a particular treatment or prophylaxis for a disease or medical condition, the following factors are relevant.

- a. **The Particularity Or Generality Of The Treatment Or Prophylaxis**
- The treatment or prophylaxis limitation must be "particular," _i.e.,_ specifically identified so that it does not encompass all applications of the judicial exception(s). For example, consider a claim that recites mentally analyzing information to identify if a patient has a genotype associated with poor metabolism of beta blocker medications. This falls within the mental process grouping of abstract ideas enumerated in **[MPEP § 2106.04(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13a9e_2dc.html)**. The claim also recites "administering a lower than normal dosage of a beta blocker medication to a patient identified as having the poor metabolizer genotype." This administration step is particular, and it integrates the mental analysis step into a practical application. Conversely, consider a claim that recites the same abstract idea and "administering a suitable medication to a patient." This administration step is not particular, and is instead merely instructions to "apply" the exception in a generic way. Thus, the administration step does not integrate the mental analysis step into a practical application.
    
    Examiners may find it helpful to evaluate other considerations such as the mere instructions to apply an exception consideration (see **[MPEP § 2106.05(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13da8_a5.html)**), and the field of use and technological environment consideration (see **[MPEP § 2106.05(h)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13e1a_22c.html)**), when making a determination of whether a treatment or prophylaxis limitation is particular or general.
    
- b. **Whether The Limitation(s) Have More Than A Nominal Or Insignificant Relationship To The Exception(s)**
- The treatment or prophylaxis limitation must have more than a nominal or insignificant relationship to the exception(s). For example, consider a claim that recites a natural correlation (law of nature) between blood glucose levels over 250 mg/dl and the risk of developing ketoacidosis (a life-threatening medical condition). The claim also recites "treating a patient having a blood glucose level over 250 mg/dl with insulin". Insulin acts to lower blood glucose levels, and administering insulin to a patient will reduce the patient’s blood glucose level, thereby lowering the risk that the patient will develop ketoacidosis. Thus, in the context of this claim, the administration step is significantly related to the recited correlation between high blood glucose levels and the risk of ketoacidosis. Because insulin is also a "particular" treatment, this administration step integrates the law of nature into a practical application. Alternatively, consider a claim that recites the same law of nature and also recites "treating a patient having a blood glucose level over 250 mg/dl with aspirin." Aspirin is not known in the art as a treatment for ketoacidosis or diabetes, although some patients with diabetes may be on aspirin therapy for other medical reasons (_e.g.,_ to control pain or inflammation, or to prevent blood clots). In the context of this claim and the recited correlation between high blood glucose levels and the risk of ketoacidosis, administration of aspirin has at best a nominal connection to the law of nature, because aspirin does not treat or prevent ketoacidosis. This step therefore does not apply or use the exception in any meaningful way. Thus, this step of administering aspirin does not integrate the law of nature into a practical application.
    
    Examiners may find it helpful to evaluate other considerations such as the insignificant extra-solution activity consideration (see **[MPEP § 2106.05(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13df8_3d4.html)**), and the field of use and technological environment consideration (see **[MPEP § 2106.05(h)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13e1a_22c.html)**), when making a determination of whether a treatment or prophylaxis limitation has more than a nominal or insignificant relationship to the exception(s).
    
- c. **Whether The Limitation(s) Are Merely Extra-Solution Activity Or A Field Of Use**
- The treatment or prophylaxis limitation must impose meaningful limits on the judicial exception, and cannot be extra-solution activity or a field-of-use. For example, consider a claim that recites (a) administering rabies and feline leukemia vaccines to a first group of domestic cats in accordance with different vaccination schedules, and (b) analyzing information about the vaccination schedules and whether the cats later developed chronic immune-mediated disorders to determine a lowest-risk vaccination schedule. Step (b) falls within the mental process grouping of abstract ideas enumerated in **[MPEP § 2106.04(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13a9e_2dc.html)**. While step (a) administers vaccines to the cats, this administration is performed in order to gather data for the mental analysis step, and is a necessary precursor for all uses of the recited exception. It is thus extra-solution activity, and does not integrate the judicial exception into a practical application. Conversely, consider a claim reciting the same steps (a) and (b), but also reciting step (c) "vaccinating a second group of domestic cats in accordance with the lowest-risk vaccination schedule." Step (c) applies the exception, in that the information from the mental analysis in step (b) is used to alter the order and timing of the vaccinations so that the second group of cats has a lower risk of developing chronic immune-mediated disorders. Step (c) thus integrates the abstract idea into a practical application.
    
    Examiners may find it helpful to evaluate other considerations such as the insignificant extra-solution activity consideration (see **[MPEP § 2106.05(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13df8_3d4.html)**), and the field of use and technological environment consideration (see **[MPEP § 2106.05(h)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13e1a_22c.html)**), when making a determination of whether a treatment or prophylaxis limitation is merely extra-solution activity or a field of use.
    

# 2106.05    Eligibility Step 2B: Whether a Claim Amounts to Significantly More [R-07.2022]

## I.    **THE SEARCH FOR AN INVENTIVE CONCEPT**

The second part of the _Alice/Mayo_ test is often referred to as a search for an inventive concept. _Alice Corp. Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank Int'l,_ 573 U.S. 208, 217, 110 USPQ2d 1976, 1981 (2014) (citing _Mayo Collaborative Servs. v. Prometheus Labs., Inc.,_ 566 U.S. 66, 71-72, 101 USPQ2d 1961, 1966 (2012)).

An inventive concept "cannot be furnished by the unpatentable law of nature (or natural phenomenon or abstract idea) itself." _Genetic Techs. Ltd. v. Merial LLC,_ 818 F.3d 1369, 1376, 118 USPQ2d 1541, 1546 (Fed. Cir. 2016). See also _Alice Corp.,_ 573 U.S. at 21-18, 110 USPQ2d at 1981 (citing _Mayo,_ 566 U.S. at 78, 101 USPQ2d at 1968 (after determining that a claim is directed to a judicial exception, "we then ask, ‘**[w]hat else** is there in the claims before us?") (emphasis added)); _RecogniCorp, LLC v. Nintendo Co.,_ 855 F.3d 1322, 1327, 122 USPQ2d 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2017) ("Adding one abstract idea (math) to another abstract idea (encoding and decoding) does not render the claim non-abstract"). Instead, an "inventive concept" is furnished by an element or combination of elements that is recited in the claim in addition to (beyond) the judicial exception, and is sufficient to ensure that the claim as a whole amounts to significantly more than the judicial exception itself. _Alice Corp.,_ 573 U.S. at 27-18, 110 USPQ2d at 1981 (citing _Mayo,_ 566 U.S. at 72-73, 101 USPQ2d at 1966).

Evaluating additional elements to determine whether they amount to an inventive concept requires considering them both individually and in combination to ensure that they amount to significantly more than the judicial exception itself. Because this approach considers all claim elements, the Supreme Court has noted that "it is consistent with the general rule that patent claims ‘must be considered as a whole.’" _Alice Corp.,_ 573 U.S. at 218 n.3, 110 USPQ2d at 1981 (quoting _Diamond v. Diehr,_ 450 U.S. 175, 188, 209 USPQ 1, 8-9 (1981)). Consideration of the elements in combination is particularly important, because even if an additional element does not amount to significantly more on its own, it can still amount to significantly more when considered in combination with the other elements of the claim. _See, e.g., Rapid Litig. Mgmt. v. CellzDirect,_ 827 F.3d 1042, 1051, 119 USPQ2d 1370, 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (process reciting combination of individually well-known freezing and thawing steps was "far from routine and conventional" and thus eligible); _BASCOM Global Internet Servs. v. AT&T Mobility LLC,_ 827 F.3d 1341, 1350, 119 USPQ2d 1236, 1242 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (inventive concept may be found in the non-conventional and non-generic arrangement of components that are individually well-known and conventional).

Although the courts often evaluate considerations such as the conventionality of an additional element in the eligibility analysis, the search for an inventive concept should not be confused with a novelty or non-obviousness determination. See _Mayo,_ 566 U.S. at 91, 101 USPQ2d at 1973 (rejecting "the Government’s invitation to substitute **[§§ 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//al_d1fbe1_234ed_52.html)**, **[103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//al_d1fbe1_19797_b0.html)**, and **[112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824912.html)**  inquiries for the better established inquiry under **[§ 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)** "). As made clear by the courts, the "‘novelty’ of any element or steps in a process, or even of the process itself, is of _**no relevance**_ in determining whether the subject matter of a claim falls within the **[§ 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  categories of possibly patentable subject matter." _Intellectual Ventures I v. Symantec Corp.,_ 838 F.3d 1307, 1315, 120 USPQ2d 1353, 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (quoting _Diamond v. Diehr,_ 450 U.S. at 188–89, 209 USPQ at 9). See also _Synopsys, Inc. v. Mentor Graphics Corp.,_ 839 F.3d 1138, 1151, 120 USPQ2d 1473, 1483 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("a claim for a _**new**_ abstract idea is still an abstract idea.

In addition, the search for an inventive concept is different from an obviousness analysis under **[35 U.S.C. 103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//al_d1fbe1_19797_b0.html)**. See, _e.g., BASCOM Global Internet v. AT&T Mobility LLC,_ 827 F.3d 1341, 1350, 119 USPQ2d 1236, 1242 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("The inventive concept inquiry requires more than recognizing that each claim element, by itself, was known in the art. . . . [A]n inventive concept can be found in the non-conventional and non-generic arrangement of known, conventional pieces."). Specifically, lack of novelty under **[35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//al_d1fbe1_234ed_52.html)**  or obviousness under **[35 U.S.C. 103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//al_d1fbe1_19797_b0.html)**  of a claimed invention does not necessarily indicate that additional elements are well-understood, routine, conventional elements. Because they are separate and distinct requirements from eligibility, patentability of the claimed invention under **[35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//al_d1fbe1_234ed_52.html)**  and **[103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//al_d1fbe1_19797_b0.html)**  with respect to the prior art is neither required for, nor a guarantee of, patent eligibility under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**. The distinction between eligibility (under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)** ) and patentability over the art (under **[35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//al_d1fbe1_234ed_52.html)**  and/or **[103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//al_d1fbe1_19797_b0.html)** ) is further discussed in **[MPEP § 2106.05(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13d41_124.html)**.

## A.    **_Relevant Considerations For Evaluating Whether Additional Elements Amount To An Inventive Concept_**

The Supreme Court has identified a number of considerations as relevant to the evaluation of whether the claimed additional elements amount to an inventive concept. The list of considerations here is not intended to be exclusive or limiting. Additional elements can often be analyzed based on more than one type of consideration and the type of consideration is of no import to the eligibility analysis. Additional discussion of these considerations, and how they were applied in particular judicial decisions, is provided in in **[MPEP § 2106.05(a) through (h)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13c69_10.html)**.

Limitations that the courts have found to qualify as "significantly more" when recited in a claim with a judicial exception include:

- i. Improvements to the functioning of a computer, _e.g.,_ a modification of conventional Internet hyperlink protocol to dynamically produce a dual-source hybrid webpage, as discussed in _DDR Holdings, LLC v. Hotels.com, L.P.,_ 773 F.3d 1245, 1258-59, 113 USPQ2d 1097, 1106-07 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (see **[MPEP § 2106.05(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13c69_10.html)**);
- ii. Improvements to any other technology or technical field, _e.g.,_ a modification of conventional rubber-molding processes to utilize a thermocouple inside the mold to constantly monitor the temperature and thus reduce under- and over-curing problems common in the art, as discussed in _Diamond v. Diehr,_ 450 U.S. 175, 191-92, 209 USPQ 1, 10 (1981) (see **[MPEP § 2106.05(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13c69_10.html)**);
- iii. Applying the judicial exception with, or by use of, a particular machine, _e.g.,_ a Fourdrinier machine (which is understood in the art to have a specific structure comprising a headbox, a paper-making wire, and a series of rolls) that is arranged in a particular way to optimize the speed of the machine while maintaining quality of the formed paper web, as discussed in _Eibel Process Co. v. Minn. & Ont. Paper Co.,_ 261 U.S. 45, 64-65 (1923) (see **[MPEP § 2106.05(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13ccf_18c.html)**);
- iv. Effecting a transformation or reduction of a particular article to a different state or thing, _e.g.,_ a process that transforms raw, uncured synthetic rubber into precision-molded synthetic rubber products, as discussed in _Diehr,_ 450 U.S. at 184, 209 USPQ at 21 (see **[MPEP § 2106.05(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13cfb_2e.html)**);
- v. Adding a specific limitation other than what is well-understood, routine, conventional activity in the field, or adding unconventional steps that confine the claim to a particular useful application, _e.g.,_ a non-conventional and non-generic arrangement of various computer components for filtering Internet content, as discussed in _BASCOM Global Internet v. AT&T Mobility LLC,_ 827 F.3d 1341, 1350-51, 119 USPQ2d 1236, 1243 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (see **[MPEP § 2106.05(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13d41_124.html)**); or
- vi. Other meaningful limitations beyond generally linking the use of the judicial exception to a particular technological environment, _e.g.,_ an immunization step that integrates an abstract idea of data comparison into a specific process of immunizing that lowers the risk that immunized patients will later develop chronic immune-mediated diseases, as discussed in _Classen Immunotherapies Inc. v. Biogen IDEC,_ 659 F.3d 1057, 1066-68, 100 USPQ2d 1492, 1499-1502 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (see **[MPEP § 2106.05(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13d61_1a8.html)**).

Limitations that the courts have found not to be enough to qualify as "significantly more" when recited in a claim with a judicial exception include:

- i. Adding the words "apply it" (or an equivalent) with the judicial exception, or mere instructions to implement an abstract idea on a computer, _e.g.,_ a limitation indicating that a particular function such as creating and maintaining electronic records is performed by a computer, as discussed in _Alice Corp.,_ 573 U.S. at 225-26, 110 USPQ2d at 1984 (see **[MPEP § 2106.05(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13da8_a5.html)**);
- ii. Simply appending well-understood, routine, conventional activities previously known to the industry, specified at a high level of generality, to the judicial exception, _e.g.,_ a claim to an abstract idea requiring no more than a generic computer to perform generic computer functions that are well-understood, routine and conventional activities previously known to the industry, as discussed in _Alice Corp.,_ 573 U.S. at 225, 110 USPQ2d at 1984 (see **[MPEP § 2106.05(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13d41_124.html)**);
- iii. Adding insignificant extra-solution activity to the judicial exception, _e.g.,_ mere data gathering in conjunction with a law of nature or abstract idea such as a step of obtaining information about credit card transactions so that the information can be analyzed by an abstract mental process, as discussed in _CyberSource v. Retail Decisions, Inc.,_ 654 F.3d 1366, 1375, 99 USPQ2d 1690, 1694 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (see **[MPEP § 2106.05(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13df8_3d4.html)**); or
- iv. Generally linking the use of the judicial exception to a particular technological environment or field of use, _e.g.,_ a claim describing how the abstract idea of hedging could be used in the commodities and energy markets, as discussed in _Bilski v. Kappos,_ 561 U.S. 593, 595, 95 USPQ2d 1001, 1010 (2010) or a claim limiting the use of a mathematical formula to the petrochemical and oil-refining fields, as discussed in _Parker v. Flook,_ 437 U.S. 584, 588-90, 198 USPQ 193, 197-98 (1978) (**[MPEP § 2106.05(h)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13e1a_22c.html)**).

It is notable that mere physicality or tangibility of an additional element or elements is not a relevant consideration in Step 2B. As the Supreme Court explained in _Alice Corp.,_ mere physical or tangible implementation of an exception is not in itself an inventive concept and does not guarantee eligibility:

> The fact that a computer "necessarily exist[s] in the physical, rather than purely conceptual, realm," is beside the point. There is no dispute that a computer is a tangible system (in **[§ 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  terms, a "machine"), or that many computer-implemented claims are formally addressed to patent-eligible subject matter. But if that were the end of the **[§ 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  inquiry, an applicant could claim any principle of the physical or social sciences by reciting a computer system configured to implement the relevant concept. Such a result would make the determination of patent eligibility "depend simply on the draftsman’s art," _Flook, supra,_ at 593, 98 S. Ct. 2522, 57 L. Ed. 2d 451, thereby eviscerating the rule that "‘[l]aws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas are not patentable,’" _Myriad,_ 133 S. Ct. 1289, 186 L. Ed. 2d 124, 133).

_Alice Corp.,_ 573 U.S. at 224, 110 USPQ2d at 1983-84 (alterations in original). See also _Genetic Technologies Ltd. v. Merial LLC,_ 818 F.3d 1369, 1377, 118 USPQ2d 1541, 1547 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (steps of DNA amplification and analysis "do not, individually or in combination, provide sufficient inventive concept to render claim 1 patent eligible" merely because they are physical steps). Conversely, the presence of a non-physical or intangible additional element does not doom the claims, because tangibility is not necessary for eligibility under the _Alice/Mayo_ test. _Enfish, LLC v. Microsoft Corp.,_ 822 F.3d 1327, 118 USPQ2d 1684 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("that the improvement is not defined by reference to ‘physical’ components does not doom the claims"). See also _McRO, Inc. v. Bandai Namco Games Am. Inc.,_ 837 F.3d 1299, 1315, 120 USPQ2d 1091, 1102 (Fed. Cir. 2016), (holding that a process producing an intangible result (a sequence of synchronized, animated characters) was eligible because it improved an existing technological process).

## B.    **_Examples Of How Courts Conduct The Search For An Inventive Concept_**

_Alice Corp._ provides an example of how courts conduct the significantly more analysis. In this case, the Supreme Court analyzed claims to computer systems, computer readable media, and computer-implemented methods, all of which described a scheme for mitigating "settlement risk," which is the risk that only one party to an agreed-upon financial exchange will satisfy its obligation. In part one of the _Alice/Mayo_ test, the Court determined that the claims were directed to the abstract idea of mitigating settlement risk. _Alice Corp.,_ 573 U.S. at 221, 110 USPQ2d at 1982. The Court then walked through part two of the _Alice/Mayo_ test, in which:

- • The Court identified the additional elements in the claim, _e.g.,_ by noting that the method claims recited steps of using a computer to "create electronic records, track multiple transactions, and issue simultaneous instructions", and that the product claims recited hardware such as a "data processing system" with a "communications controller" and a "data storage unit" (573 U.S. at 224-26, 110 USPQ2d at 1984-85);
- • The Court considered the additional elements individually, noting that all the computer functions were "‘well-understood, routine, conventional activit[ies]’ previously known to the industry," each step "does no more than require a generic computer to perform generic computer functions", and the recited hardware was "purely functional and generic" (573 U.S. at 225-26, 110 USPQ2d at 1984-85); and
- • The Court considered the additional elements "as an ordered combination," and determined that "the computer components … ‘[a]dd nothing … that is not already present when the steps are considered separately’" and simply recite intermediated settlement as performed by a generic computer." 573 U.S. at 225 (citing _Mayo,_ 566 U.S. at 79, 101 USPQ2d at 1972).

Based on this analysis, the Court concluded that the claims amounted to "‘nothing significantly more’ than an instruction to apply the abstract idea of intermediated settlement using some unspecified, generic computer", and therefore held the claims ineligible because they were directed to a judicial exception and failed the second part of the _Alice/Mayo_ test. _Alice Corp.,_ 573 U.S. at 225-27, 110 USPQ2d at 1984.

_BASCOM_ provides another example of how courts conduct the significantly more analysis, and of the critical importance of considering the additional elements in combination. In this case, the Federal Circuit vacated a judgment of ineligibility because the district court failed to properly perform the second step of the _Alice/Mayo_ test when analyzing a claimed system for filtering content retrieved from an Internet computer network. _BASCOM Global Internet v. AT&T Mobility LLC,_ 827 F.3d 1341, 119 USPQ2d 1236 (Fed. Cir. 2016). The Federal Circuit agreed with the district court that the claims were directed to the abstract idea of filtering Internet content, and then walked through the district court’s analysis in part two of the _Alice/Mayo_ test, noting that:

- • The district court properly identified the additional elements in the claims, such as a "local client computer," "remote ISP server," "Internet computer network," and "controlled access network accounts" (827 F.3d at 1349, 119 USPQ2d at 1242);
- • The district court properly considered the additional elements individually, for example by consulting the specification, which described each of the additional elements as "well-known generic computer components" (827 F.3d at 1349, 119 USPQ2d at 1242); and
- • The district court should have considered the additional elements in combination, because the "inventive concept inquiry requires more than recognizing that each claim element, by itself, was known in the art" (827 F.3d at 1350, 119 USPQ2d at 1242).

Based on this analysis, the Federal Circuit concluded that the district court erred by failing to recognize that when combined, an inventive concept may be found in the non-conventional and non-generic arrangement of the additional elements, i.e., the installation of a filtering tool at a specific location, remote from the end-users, with customizable filtering features specific to each end user. 827 F.3d at 1350, 119 USPQ2d at 1242.

## II.    **ELIGIBILITY STEP 2B: WHETHER THE ADDITIONAL ELEMENTS CONTRIBUTE AN "INVENTIVE CONCEPT"**

As described in **[MPEP § 2106](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e197244.html)**, subsection III, Step 2B of the Office’s eligibility analysis is the second part of the _Alice/Mayo_ test, _i.e.,_ the Supreme Court’s "framework for distinguishing patents that claim laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas from those that claim patent-eligible applications of those concepts." _Alice Corp. Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank Int'l,_ 573 U.S. 208, 217, 110 USPQ2d 1976, 1981 (2014) (citing _Mayo,_ 566 U.S. 66, 101 USPQ2d 1961 (2012)). Like the other steps in the eligibility analysis, evaluation of this step should be made after determining what the inventor has invented by reviewing the entire application disclosure and construing the claims in accordance with their broadest reasonable interpretation. See **[MPEP § 2106](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e197244.html)**, subsection II for more information about the importance of understanding what has been invented, and **[MPEP § 2111](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e200352.html)** for more information about the broadest reasonable interpretation.

Step 2B asks: Does the claim recite additional elements that amount to significantly more than the judicial exception? Examiners should answer this question by first identifying whether there are any additional elements (features/limitations/steps) recited in the claim beyond the judicial exception(s), and then evaluating those additional elements individually **and in combination** to determine whether they contribute an inventive concept (_i.e.,_ amount to significantly more than the judicial exception(s)).

This evaluation is made with respect to the considerations that the Supreme Court has identified as relevant to the eligibility analysis, which are introduced generally in Part I.A of this section, and discussed in detail in **[MPEP § 2106.05(a) through (h)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13c69_10.html)**. Many of these considerations overlap, and often more than one consideration is relevant to analysis of an additional element. Not all considerations will be relevant to every element, or every claim. Because the evaluation in Step 2B is not a weighing test, it is not important how the elements are characterized or how many considerations apply from this list. It is important to evaluate the significance of the additional elements relative to the invention, and to keep in mind the ultimate question of whether the additional elements encompass an inventive concept.

Although the conclusion of whether a claim is eligible at Step 2B requires that all relevant considerations be evaluated, most of these considerations were already evaluated in Step 2A Prong Two. Thus, in Step 2B, examiners should:

- • Carry over their identification of the additional element(s) in the claim from Step 2A Prong Two;
- • Carry over their conclusions from Step 2A Prong Two on the considerations discussed in **[MPEP §§ 2106.05(a) - (c), (e) (f) and (h)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13c69_10.html)**:
- • Re-evaluate any additional element or combination of elements that was considered to be insignificant extra-solution activity per **[MPEP § 2106.05(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13df8_3d4.html)**, because if such re-evaluation finds that the element is unconventional or otherwise more than what is well-understood, routine, conventional activity in the field, this finding may indicate that the additional element is no longer considered to be insignificant; and
- • Evaluate whether any additional element or combination of elements are other than what is well-understood, routine, conventional activity in the field, or simply append well-understood, routine, conventional activities previously known to the industry, specified at a high level of generality, to the judicial exception, per **[MPEP § 2106.05(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13d41_124.html)**.

In the context of the flowchart in **[MPEP § 2106](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e197244.html)**, subsection III, Step 2B determines whether:

- • The claim as a whole does not amount to significantly more than the exception itself (there is no inventive concept in the claim) (Step 2B: NO) and thus is not eligible, warranting a rejection for lack of subject matter eligibility and concluding the eligibility analysis; or
- • The claim as a whole does amount to significantly more than the exception (there is an inventive concept in the claim) (Step 2B: YES), and thus is eligible at Pathway C, thereby concluding the eligibility analysis.

Examiners should examine each claim for eligibility separately, based on the particular elements recited therein. Claims should not be judged to automatically stand or fall with similar claims in an application. For instance, one claim may be ineligible because it is directed to a judicial exception without amounting to significantly more, but another claim dependent on the first may be eligible because it recites additional elements that do amount to significantly more.

For more information on how to evaluate claims reciting multiple judicial exceptions, see **[MPEP § 2106.04](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_139db_e0.html)**, subsection II.B.

If the claim as a whole does recite significantly more than the exception itself, the claim is eligible (Step 2B: YES) at Pathway C, and the eligibility analysis is complete. If there are no meaningful limitations in the claim that transform the exception into a patent-eligible application, such that the claim does not amount to significantly more than the exception itself, the claim is not patent-eligible (Step 2B: NO) and should be rejected under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**. See **[MPEP § 2106.07](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13fb7_330.html)** for information on how to formulate an ineligibility rejection.

# 2106.05(a)    Improvements to the Functioning of a Computer or To Any Other Technology or Technical Field [R-07.2022]

In determining patent eligibility, examiners should consider whether the claim "purport(s) to improve the functioning of the computer itself" or "any other technology or technical field." _Alice Corp. Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank Int’l,_ 573 U.S. 208, 225, 110 USPQ2d 1976, 1984 (2014). This consideration has also been referred to as the search for a technological solution to a technological problem. See e.g., _DDR Holdings, LLC. v. Hotels.com, L.P.,_ 773 F.3d 1245, 1257, 113 USPQ2d 1097, 1105 (Fed. Cir. 2014); _Amdocs (Israel), Ltd. v. Openet Telecom, Inc.,_ 841 F.3d 1288, 1300-01, 120 USPQ2d 1527, 1537 (Fed. Cir. 2016).

While improvements were evaluated in _Alice Corp._ as relevant to the search for an inventive concept (Step 2B), several decisions of the Federal Circuit have also evaluated this consideration when determining whether a claim was directed to an abstract idea (Step 2A). See, e.g., _Enfish, LLC v. Microsoft Corp.,_ 822 F.3d 1327, 1335-36, 118 USPQ2d 1684, 1689 (Fed. Cir. 2016); _McRO, Inc. v. Bandai Namco Games Am. Inc.,_ 837 F.3d 1299, 1314-16, 120 USPQ2d 1091, 1102-03 (Fed. Cir. 2016); _Visual Memory, LLC v. NVIDIA Corp.,_ 867 F.3d 1253, 1259-60, 123 USPQ2d 1712, 1717 (Fed. Cir. 2017). Thus, an examiner should evaluate whether a claim contains an improvement to the functioning of a computer or to any other technology or technical field at Step 2A Prong Two and Step 2B, as well as when considering whether the claim has such self-evident eligibility that it qualifies for the streamlined analysis. See **[MPEP § 2106.04(d)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d2e7df_24a6e_1bd.html)** for more information about evaluating improvements in Step 2A Prong Two, and **[MPEP § 2106.07(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_14065_2a0.html)** for more information about improvements in the streamlined analysis context.

If it is asserted that the invention improves upon conventional functioning of a computer, or upon conventional technology or technological processes, a technical explanation as to how to implement the invention should be present in the specification. That is, the disclosure must provide sufficient details such that one of ordinary skill in the art would recognize the claimed invention as providing an improvement. The specification need not explicitly set forth the improvement, but it must describe the invention such that the improvement would be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art. Conversely, if the specification explicitly sets forth an improvement but in a conclusory manner (i.e., a bare assertion of an improvement without the detail necessary to be apparent to a person of ordinary skill in the art), the examiner should not determine the claim improves technology. An indication that the claimed invention provides an improvement can include a discussion in the specification that identifies a technical problem and explains the details of an unconventional technical solution expressed in the claim, or identifies technical improvements realized by the claim over the prior art. For example, in _McRO,_ the court relied on the specification’s explanation of how the particular rules recited in the claim enabled the automation of specific animation tasks that previously could only be performed subjectively by humans, when determining that the claims were directed to improvements in computer animation instead of an abstract idea. _McRO,_ 837 F.3d at 1313-14, 120 USPQ2d at 1100-01. In contrast, the court in _Affinity Labs of Tex. v. DirecTV, LLC_ relied on the specification’s failure to provide details regarding the manner in which the invention accomplished the alleged improvement when holding the claimed methods of delivering broadcast content to cellphones ineligible. 838 F.3d 1253, 1263-64, 120 USPQ2d 1201, 1207-08 (Fed. Cir. 2016).

After the examiner has consulted the specification and determined that the disclosed invention improves technology, the claim must be evaluated to ensure the claim itself reflects the disclosed improvement in technology. _Intellectual Ventures I LLC v. Symantec Corp.,_ 838 F.3d 1307, 1316, 120 USPQ2d 1353, 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (patent owner argued that the claimed email filtering system improved technology by shrinking the protection gap and mooting the volume problem, but the court disagreed because the claims themselves did not have any limitations that addressed these issues). That is, the claim must include the components or steps of the invention that provide the improvement described in the specification. However, the claim itself does not need to explicitly recite the improvement described in the specification (_e.g.,_ "thereby increasing the bandwidth of the channel"). The full scope of the claim under the BRI should be considered to determine if the claim reflects an improvement in technology (_e.g.,_ the improvement described in the specification). In making this determination, it is critical that examiners look at the claim "as a whole," in other words, the claim should be evaluated "as an ordered combination, without ignoring the requirements of the individual steps." When performing this evaluation, examiners should be "careful to avoid oversimplifying the claims" by looking at them generally and failing to account for the specific requirements of the claims. _McRO,_ 837 F.3d at 1313, 120 USPQ2d at 1100.

An important consideration in determining whether a claim improves technology is the extent to which the claim covers a particular solution to a problem or a particular way to achieve a desired outcome, as opposed to merely claiming the idea of a solution or outcome. _McRO,_ 837 F.3d at 1314-15, 120 USPQ2d at 1102-03; _DDR Holdings,_ 773 F.3d at 1259, 113 USPQ2d at 1107. In this respect, the improvement consideration overlaps with other considerations, specifically the particular machine consideration (see **[MPEP § 2106.05(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13ccf_18c.html)**), and the mere instructions to apply an exception consideration (see **[MPEP § 2106.05(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13da8_a5.html)**). Thus, evaluation of those other considerations may assist examiners in making a determination of whether a claim satisfies the improvement consideration.

It is important to note, the judicial exception alone cannot provide the improvement. The improvement can be provided by one or more additional elements. See the discussion of _Diamond v. Diehr_, 450 U.S. 175, 187 and 191-92, 209 USPQ 1, 10 (1981)) in subsection II, below. In addition, the improvement can be provided by the additional element(s) in combination with the recited judicial exception. See **[MPEP § 2106.04(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d2e7df_235a2_338.html)** (discussing _Finjan, Inc. v. Blue Coat Sys., Inc.,_ 879 F.3d 1299, 1303-04, 125 USPQ2d 1282, 1285-87 (Fed. Cir. 2018)). Thus, it is important for examiners to analyze the claim as a whole when determining whether the claim provides an improvement to the functioning of computers or an improvement to other technology or technical field.

During examination, the examiner should analyze the "improvements" consideration by evaluating the specification and the claims to ensure that a technical explanation of the asserted improvement is present in the specification, and that the claim reflects the asserted improvement. Generally, examiners are not expected to make a qualitative judgement on the merits of the asserted improvement. If the examiner concludes the disclosed invention does not improve technology, the burden shifts to applicant to provide persuasive arguments supported by any necessary evidence to demonstrate that one of ordinary skill in the art would understand that the disclosed invention improves technology. Any such evidence submitted under **[37 CFR 1.132](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e323552.html)**  must establish what the specification would convey to one of ordinary skill in the art and cannot be used to supplement the specification. See, _e.g._ **[MPEP § 716.09](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e93742.html)** on **[37 CFR 1.132](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e323552.html)**  practice with respect to rejections under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**. For example, in response to a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**, an applicant could submit a declaration under **[§ 1.132](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e323552.html)**  providing testimony on how one of ordinary skill in the art would interpret the disclosed invention as improving technology and the underlying factual basis for that conclusion.

## I.    **IMPROVEMENTS TO COMPUTER FUNCTIONALITY**

In computer-related technologies, the examiner should determine whether the claim purports to improve computer capabilities or, instead, invokes computers merely as a tool. _Enfish, LLC v. Microsoft Corp.,_ 822 F.3d 1327, 1336, 118 USPQ2d 1684, 1689 (Fed. Cir. 2016). In _Enfish,_ the court evaluated the patent eligibility of claims related to a self-referential database. _Id._ The court concluded the claims were not directed to an abstract idea, but rather an improvement to computer functionality. _Id._ It was the specification’s discussion of the prior art and how the invention improved the way the computer stores and retrieves data in memory in combination with the specific data structure recited in the claims that demonstrated eligibility. 822 F.3d at 1339, 118 USPQ2d at 1691. The claim was not simply the addition of general purpose computers added post-hoc to an abstract idea, but a specific implementation of a solution to a problem in the software arts. 822 F.3d at 1339, 118 USPQ2d at 1691.

Examples that the courts have indicated may show an improvement in computer-functionality:

- i. A modification of conventional Internet hyperlink protocol to dynamically produce a dual-source hybrid webpage, _DDR Holdings,_ 773 F.3d at 1258-59, 113 USPQ2d at 1106-07;
- ii. Inventive distribution of functionality within a network to filter Internet content, _BASCOM Global Internet v. AT&T Mobility LLC,_ 827 F.3d 1341, 1350-51, 119 USPQ2d 1236, 1243 (Fed. Cir. 2016);
- iii. A method of rendering a halftone digital image, _Research Corp. Techs. v. Microsoft Corp.,_ 627 F.3d 859, 868-69, 97 USPQ2d 1274, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2010);
- iv. A distributed network architecture operating in an unconventional fashion to reduce network congestion while generating networking accounting data records, _Amdocs (Israel), Ltd. v. Openet Telecom, Inc.,_ 841 F.3d 1288, 1300-01, 120 USPQ2d 1527, 1536-37 (Fed. Cir. 2016);
- v. A memory system having programmable operational characteristics that are configurable based on the type of processor, which can be used with different types of processors without a tradeoff in processor performance, _Visual Memory, LLC v. NVIDIA Corp.,_ 867 F.3d 1253, 1259-60, 123 USPQ2d 1712, 1717 (Fed. Cir. 2017);
- vi. Technical details as to how to transmit images over a cellular network or append classification information to digital image data, _TLI Communications LLC v. AV Auto. LLC,_ 823 F.3d 607, 614-15, 118 USPQ2d 1744, 1749-50 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (holding the claims ineligible because they fail to provide requisite technical details necessary to carry out the function);
- vii. Particular structure of a server that stores organized digital images, _TLI Communications,_ 823 F.3d at 612, 118 USPQ2d at 1747 (finding the use of a generic server insufficient to add inventive concepts to an abstract idea);
- viii. A particular way of programming or designing software to create menus, _Apple, Inc. v. Ameranth, Inc.,_ 842 F.3d 1229, 1241, 120 USPQ2d 1844, 1854 (Fed. Cir. 2016);
- ix. A method that generates a security profile that identifies both hostile and potentially hostile operations, and can protect the user against both previously unknown viruses and "obfuscated code," which is an improvement over traditional virus scanning. _Finjan Inc. v. Blue Coat Systems,_ 879 F.3d 1299, 1304, 125 USPQ2d 1282, 1286 (Fed. Cir. 2018);
- x. An improved user interface for electronic devices that displays an application summary of unlaunched applications, where the particular data in the summary is selectable by a user to launch the respective application. _Core Wireless Licensing S.A.R.L., v. LG Electronics, Inc.,_ 880 F.3d 1356, 1362-63, 125 USPQ2d 1436, 1440-41 (Fed. Cir. 2018);
- xi. Specific interface and implementation for navigating complex three-dimensional spreadsheets using techniques unique to computers; _Data Engine Techs., LLC v. Google LLC,_ 906 F.3d 999, 1009, 128 USPQ2d 1381, 1387 (Fed. Cir. 2018); and
- xii. A specific method of restricting software operation within a license, _Ancora Tech., Inc. v. HTC America, Inc.,_ 908 F.3d 1343, 1345-46, 128 USPQ2d 1565, 1567 (Fed. Cir. 2018).

It is important to note that in order for a method claim to improve computer functionality, the broadest reasonable interpretation of the claim must be limited to computer implementation. That is, a claim whose entire scope can be performed mentally, cannot be said to improve computer technology. _Synopsys, Inc. v. Mentor Graphics Corp.,_ 839 F.3d 1138, 120 USPQ2d 1473 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (a method of translating a logic circuit into a hardware component description of a logic circuit was found to be ineligible because the method did not employ a computer and a skilled artisan could perform all the steps mentally). Similarly, a claimed process covering embodiments that can be performed on a computer, as well as embodiments that can be practiced verbally or with a telephone, cannot improve computer technology. See _RecogniCorp, LLC v. Nintendo Co.,_ 855 F.3d 1322, 1328, 122 USPQ2d 1377, 1381 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (process for encoding/decoding facial data using image codes assigned to particular facial features held ineligible because the process did not require a computer).

Examples that the courts have indicated may not be sufficient to show an improvement in computer-functionality:

- i. Generating restaurant menus with functionally claimed features, _Ameranth,_ 842 F.3d at 1245, 120 USPQ2d at 1857;
- ii. Accelerating a process of analyzing audit log data when the increased speed comes solely from the capabilities of a general-purpose computer, _FairWarning IP, LLC v. Iatric Sys.,_ 839 F.3d 1089, 1095, 120 USPQ2d 1293, 1296 (Fed. Cir. 2016);
- iii. Mere automation of manual processes, such as using a generic computer to process an application for financing a purchase, _Credit Acceptance Corp. v. Westlake Services,_ 859 F.3d 1044, 1055, 123 USPQ2d 1100, 1108-09 (Fed. Cir. 2017) or speeding up a loan-application process by enabling borrowers to avoid physically going to or calling each lender and filling out a loan application, _LendingTree, LLC v. Zillow, Inc.,_ 656 Fed. App'x 991, 996-97 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (non-precedential);
- iv. Recording, transmitting, and archiving digital images by use of conventional or generic technology in a nascent but well-known environment, without any assertion that the invention reflects an inventive solution to any problem presented by combining a camera and a cellular telephone, _TLI Communications,_ 823 F.3d at 611-12, 118 USPQ2d at 1747;
- v. Affixing a barcode to a mail object in order to more reliably identify the sender and speed up mail processing, without any limitations specifying the technical details of the barcode or how it is generated or processed, _Secured Mail Solutions, LLC v. Universal Wilde, Inc.,_ 873 F.3d 905, 910-11, 124 USPQ2d 1502, 1505-06 (Fed. Cir. 2017);
- vi. Instructions to display two sets of information on a computer display in a non-interfering manner, without any limitations specifying how to achieve the desired result, _Interval Licensing LLC v. AOL, Inc.,_ 896 F.3d 1335, 1344-45, 127 USPQ2d 1553, 1559-60 (Fed. Cir. 2018);
- vii. Providing historical usage information to users while they are inputting data, in order to improve the quality and organization of information added to a database, because "an improvement to the information stored by a database is not equivalent to an improvement in the database’s functionality," _BSG Tech LLC v. Buyseasons, Inc.,_ 899 F.3d 1281, 1287-88, 127 USPQ2d 1688, 1693-94 (Fed. Cir. 2018); and
- viii. Arranging transactional information on a graphical user interface in a manner that assists traders in processing information more quickly, _Trading Technologies v. IBG LLC,_ 921 F.3d 1084, 1093-94, 2019 USPQ2d 138290 (Fed. Cir. 2019).

## II.    **IMPROVEMENTS TO ANY OTHER TECHNOLOGY OR TECHNICAL FIELD**

The courts have also found that improvements in technology beyond computer functionality may demonstrate patent eligibility. In _McRO,_ the Federal Circuit held claimed methods of automatic lip synchronization and facial expression animation using computer-implemented rules to be patent eligible under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**, because they were not directed to an abstract idea. _McRO,_ 837 F.3d at 1316, 120 USPQ2d at 1103. The basis for the _McRO_ court's decision was that the claims were directed to an improvement in computer animation and thus did not recite a concept similar to previously identified abstract ideas. _Id._ The court relied on the specification's explanation of how the claimed rules enabled the automation of specific animation tasks that previously could not be automated. 837 F.3d at 1313, 120 USPQ2d at 1101. The _McRO_ court indicated that it was the incorporation of the particular claimed rules in computer animation that "improved [the] existing technological process", unlike cases such as _Alice_ where a computer was merely used as a tool to perform an existing process. 837 F.3d at 1314, 120 USPQ2d at 1102. The _McRO_ court also noted that the claims at issue described a specific way (use of particular rules to set morph weights and transitions through phonemes) to solve the problem of producing accurate and realistic lip synchronization and facial expressions in animated characters, rather than merely claiming the idea of a solution or outcome, and thus were not directed to an abstract idea. 837 F.3d at 1313, 120 USPQ2d at 1101.

Consideration of improvements is relevant to the eligibility analysis regardless of the technology of the claimed invention. That is, the consideration applies equally whether it is a computer-implemented invention, an invention in the life sciences, or any other technology. See, _e.g., Rapid Litigation Management v. CellzDirect, Inc.,_ 827 F.3d 1042, 119 USPQ2d 1370 (Fed. Cir. 2016), in which the court noted that a claimed process for preserving hepatocytes could be eligible as an improvement to technology because the claim achieved a new and improved way for preserving hepatocyte cells for later use, even though the claim is based on the discovery of something natural. Notably, the court did not distinguish between the types of technology when determining the invention improved technology. However, it is important to keep in mind that an improvement in the abstract idea itself (_e.g._ a recited fundamental economic concept) is not an improvement in technology. For example, in _Trading Technologies Int’l v. IBG,_ 921 F.3d 1084, 1093-94, 2019 USPQ2d 138290 (Fed. Cir. 2019), the court determined that the claimed user interface simply provided a trader with more information to facilitate market trades, which improved the business process of market trading but did not improve computers or technology.

Examples that the courts have indicated may be sufficient to show an improvement in existing technology include:

- i. Particular computerized method of operating a rubber molding press, _e.g.,_ a modification of conventional rubber-molding processes to utilize a thermocouple inside the mold to constantly monitor the temperature and thus reduce under- and over-curing problems common in the art, _Diamond v. Diehr,_ 450 U.S. 175, 187 and 191-92, 209 USPQ 1, 8 and 10 (1981);
- ii. New telephone, server, or combination thereof, _TLI Communications LLC v. AV Auto. LLC,_ 823 F.3d 607, 612, 118 USPQ2d 1744, 1747 (Fed. Cir. 2016);
- iii. An advance in the process of downloading content for streaming, _Affinity Labs of Tex. v. DirecTV, LLC,_ 838 F.3d 1253, 1256, 120 USPQ2d 1201, 1202 (Fed. Cir. 2016);
- iv. Improved, particular method of digital data compression, _DDR Holdings, LLC. v. Hotels.com, L.P.,_ 773 F.3d 1245, 1259, 113 USPQ2d 1097, 1107 (Fed. Cir. 2014); _Intellectual Ventures I v. Symantec Corp.,_ 838 F.3d 1307, 1315, 120 USPQ2d 1353, 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2016);
- v. Particular method of incorporating virus screening into the Internet, _Symantec Corp.,_ 838 F.3d at 1321-22, 120 USPQ2d at 1362-63;
- vi. Components or methods, such as measurement devices or techniques, that generate new data, _Electric Power Group, LLC v. Alstom, S.A.,_ 830 F.3d 1350, 1355, 119 USPQ2d 1739, 1742 (Fed. Cir. 2016);
- vii. Particular configuration of inertial sensors and a particular method of using the raw data from the sensors, _Thales Visionix, Inc. v. United States,_ 850 F.3d 1343, 1348-49, 121 USPQ2d 1898, 1902 (Fed. Cir. 2017);
- viii. A specific, structured graphical user interface that improves the accuracy of trader transactions by displaying bid and asked prices in a particular manner that prevents order entry at a changed price, _Trading Techs. Int’l, Inc. v. CQG, Inc.,_ 675 Fed. App'x 1001 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (non-precedential); and
- ix. Improved process for preserving hepatocytes for later use, _Rapid Litig. Mgmt. v. CellzDirect, Inc.,_ 827 F.3d 1042, 1050, 119 USPQ2d 1370, 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2016).

To show that the involvement of a computer assists in improving the technology, the claims must recite the details regarding how a computer aids the method, the extent to which the computer aids the method, or the significance of a computer to the performance of the method. Merely adding generic computer components to perform the method is not sufficient. Thus, the claim must include more than mere instructions to perform the method on a generic component or machinery to qualify as an improvement to an existing technology. See **[MPEP § 2106.05(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13da8_a5.html)** for more information about mere instructions to apply an exception.

Examples that the courts have indicated may not be sufficient to show an improvement to technology include:

- i. A commonplace business method being applied on a general purpose computer, _Alice Corp.,_ 573 U.S. at 223, 110 USPQ2d at 1976; _Versata Dev. Group, Inc. v. SAP Am., Inc.,_ 793 F.3d 1306, 1334, 115 USPQ2d 1681, 1701 (Fed. Cir. 2015);
- ii. Using well-known standard laboratory techniques to detect enzyme levels in a bodily sample such as blood or plasma, _Cleveland Clinic Foundation v. True Health Diagnostics, LLC,_ 859 F.3d 1352, 1355, 1362, 123 USPQ2d 1081, 1082-83, 1088 (Fed. Cir. 2017);
- iii. Gathering and analyzing information using conventional techniques and displaying the result, _TLI Communications,_ 823 F.3d at 612-13, 118 USPQ2d at 1747-48;
- iv. Delivering broadcast content to a portable electronic device such as a cellular telephone, when claimed at a high level of generality, _Affinity Labs of Tex. v. Amazon.com,_ 838 F.3d 1266, 1270, 120 USPQ2d 1210, 1213 (Fed. Cir. 2016); _Affinity Labs of Tex. v. DirecTV, LLC,_ 838 F.3d 1253, 1262, 120 USPQ2d 1201, 1207 (Fed. Cir. 2016);
- v. A general method of screening emails on a generic computer, _Symantec,_ 838 F.3d at 1315-16, 120 USPQ2d at 1358-59;
- vi. An advance in the informational content of a download for streaming, _Affinity Labs of Tex. v. DirecTV, LLC,_ 838 F.3d 1253, 1263, 120 USPQ2d 1201, 1208 (Fed. Cir. 2016); and
- vii. Selecting one type of content (_e.g.,_ FM radio content) from within a range of existing broadcast content types, or selecting a particular generic function for computer hardware to perform (e.g., buffering content) from within a range of well-known, routine, conventional functions performed by the hardware, _Affinity Labs of Tex. v. DirecTV, LLC,_ 838 F.3d 1253, 1264, 120 USPQ2d 1201, 1208 (Fed. Cir. 2016).

# 2106.05(b)    Particular Machine [R-07.2022]

When determining whether a claim integrates a judicial exception, into a practical application in Step 2A Prong Two and whether a claim recites significantly more than a judicial exception in Step 2B, examiners should consider whether the judicial exception is applied with, or by use of, a particular machine. "The machine-or-transformation test is a useful and important clue, and investigative tool" for determining whether a claim is patent eligible under **[§ 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**. _Bilski v. Kappos,_ 561 U.S. 593, 604, 95 USPQ2d 1001, 1007 (2010).

It is noted that while the application of a judicial exception by or with a particular machine is an important clue, it is not a stand-alone test for eligibility. _Id._

All claims must be evaluated for eligibility using the two-part test from _Alice/Mayo_. If a claim passes the _Alice/Mayo_ test (_i.e.,_ is not directed to an exception at Step 2A, or amounts to significantly more than any recited exception in Step 2B), then the claim is eligible even if it fails the machine-or-transformation test ("M-or-T test"). _Bilski v. Kappos,_ 561 U.S. 593, 604, 95 USPQ2d 1001, 1007 (2010) (explaining that a claim may be eligible even if it does not satisfy the M-or-T test); _McRO, Inc. v. Bandai Namco Games Am. Inc.,_ 837 F.3d 1299, 1315, 120 USPQ2d 1091, 1102 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[T]here is nothing that requires a method ‘be tied to a machine or transform an article’ to be patentable"). And if a claim fails the _Alice/Mayo_ test (_i.e.,_ is directed to an exception at Step 2A and does not amount to significantly more than the exception in Step 2B), then the claim is ineligible even if it passes the M-or-T test. _DDR Holdings, LLC v. Hotels.com, L.P.,_ 773 F.3d 1245, 1256, 113 USPQ2d 1097, 1104 (Fed. Cir. 2014) ("[I]n _Mayo,_ the Supreme Court emphasized that satisfying the machine-or-transformation test, by itself, is not sufficient to render a claim patent-eligible, as not all transformations or machine implementations infuse an otherwise ineligible claim with an 'inventive concept.'").

Examiners may find it helpful to evaluate other considerations such as the mere instructions to apply an exception consideration (see **[MPEP § 2106.05(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13da8_a5.html)**), the insignificant extra-solution activity consideration (see **[MPEP § 2106.05(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13df8_3d4.html)**), and the field of use and technological environment consideration (see **[MPEP § 2106.05(h)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13e1a_22c.html)**), when making a determination of whether an element (or combination of elements) is a particular machine. For information on the definition of the term "machine," see **[MPEP § 2106.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_139b2_397.html)**.

When determining whether a machine recited in a claim provides significantly more, the following factors are relevant.

## I.    **THE PARTICULARITY OR GENERALITY OF THE ELEMENTS OF THE MACHINE OR APPARATUS**

The particularity or generality of the elements of the machine or apparatus, _i.e.,_ the degree to which the machine in the claim can be specifically identified (not any and all machines). One example of applying a judicial exception with a particular machine is _Mackay Radio & Tel. Co. v. Radio Corp. of America,_ 306 U.S. 86, 40 USPQ 199 (1939). In this case, a mathematical formula was employed to use standing wave phenomena in an antenna system. The claim recited the particular type of antenna and included details as to the shape of the antenna and the conductors, particularly the length and angle at which they were arranged. 306 U.S. at 95-96; 40 USPQ at 203. Another example is _Eibel Process,_ in which gravity (a law of nature or natural phenomenon) was applied by a Fourdrinier machine (which was understood in the art to have a specific structure comprising a headbox, a paper-making wire, and a series of rolls) arranged in a particular way to optimize the speed of the machine while maintaining quality of the formed paper web. _Eibel Process Co. v. Minn. & Ont. Paper Co.,_ 261 U.S. 45, 64-65 (1923).

It is important to note that a general purpose computer that applies a judicial exception, such as an abstract idea, by use of conventional computer functions does not qualify as a particular machine. _Ultramercial, Inc. v. Hulu, LLC,_ 772 F.3d 709, 716-17, 112 USPQ2d 1750, 1755-56 (Fed. Cir. 2014). See also _TLI Communications LLC v. AV Automotive LLC,_ 823 F.3d 607, 613, 118 USPQ2d 1744, 1748 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (mere recitation of concrete or tangible components is not an inventive concept); _Eon Corp. IP Holdings LLC v. AT&T Mobility LLC,_ 785 F.3d 616, 623, 114 USPQ2d 1711, 1715 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (noting that _Alappat_’s rationale that an otherwise ineligible algorithm or software could be made patent-eligible by merely adding a generic computer to the claim was superseded by the Supreme Court’s _Bilski_ and _Alice Corp._ decisions). If applicant amends a claim to add a generic computer or generic computer components and asserts that the claim recites significantly more because the generic computer is 'specially programmed' (as in _Alappat,_ now considered superseded) or is a 'particular machine' (as in _Bilski_), the examiner should look at whether the added elements integrate the exception into a practical application or provide significantly more than the judicial exception. Merely adding a generic computer, generic computer components, or a programmed computer to perform generic computer functions does not automatically overcome an eligibility rejection. _Alice Corp. Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank Int’l,_ 573 U.S. 208, 223-24, 110 USPQ2d 1976, 1983-84 (2014). See _In re Alappat_, 33 F.3d 1526, 1545, 31 USPQ2d 1545, 1558 (Fed. Cir. 1994); _In re Bilski_, 545 F.3d 943, 88 USPQ2d 1385 (Fed. Cir. 2008)

## II.    **WHETHER THE MACHINE OR APPARATUS IMPLEMENTS THE STEPS OF THE METHOD**

Integral use of a machine to achieve performance of a method may integrate the recited judicial exception into a practical application or provide significantly more, in contrast to where the machine is merely an object on which the method operates, which does not integrate the exception into a practical application or provide significantly more. See _CyberSource v. Retail Decisions,_ 654 F.3d 1366, 1370, 99 USPQ2d 1690, 1694 (Fed. Cir. 2011) ("We are not persuaded by the appellant's argument that the claimed method is tied to a particular machine because it ‘would not be necessary or possible without the Internet.’ . . . Regardless of whether "the Internet" can be viewed as a machine, it is clear that the Internet cannot perform the fraud detection steps of the claimed method"). For example, as described in **[MPEP § 2106.05(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13da8_a5.html)**, additional elements that invoke computers or other machinery merely as a tool to perform an existing process will generally not amount to significantly more than a judicial exception. See, e.g., _Versata Development Group v. SAP America,_ 793 F.3d 1306, 1335, 115 USPQ2d 1681, 1702 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (explaining that in order for a machine to add significantly more, it must "play a significant part in permitting the claimed method to be performed, rather than function solely as an obvious mechanism for permitting a solution to be achieved more quickly").

## III.    **WHETHER ITS INVOLVEMENT IS EXTRA-SOLUTION ACTIVITY OR A FIELD-OF-USE**

Whether its involvement is extra-solution activity or a field-of-use, _i.e.,_ the extent to which (or how) the machine or apparatus imposes meaningful limits on the claim. Use of a machine that contributes only nominally or insignificantly to the execution of the claimed method (e.g., in a data gathering step or in a field-of-use limitation) would not integrate a judicial exception or provide significantly more. See _Bilski,_ 561 U.S. at 610, 95 USPQ2d at 1009 (citing _Parker v. Flook,_ 437 U.S. 584, 590, 198 USPQ 193, 197 (1978)), and _CyberSource v. Retail Decisions,_ 654 F.3d 1366, 1370, 99 USPQ2d 1690 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (citations omitted) ("[N]othing in claim 3 requires an infringer to use the Internet to obtain that data. The Internet is merely described as the source of the data. We have held that mere ‘[data-gathering] step[s] cannot make an otherwise nonstatutory claim statutory.’" 654 F.3d at 1375, 99 USPQ2d at 1694 (citation omitted)). See **[MPEP § 2106.05(g) & (h)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13df8_3d4.html)** for more information on insignificant extra-solution activity and field of use, respectively.

# 2106.05(c)    Particular Transformation [R-07.2022]

Another consideration when determining whether a claim integrates a judicial exception into a practical application in Step 2A Prong Two and whether a claim recites significantly more in Step 2B is whether the claim effects a transformation or reduction of a particular article to a different state or thing. "[T]ransformation and reduction of an article ‘to a different state or thing’ is the clue to patentability of a process claim that does not include particular machines." _Bilski v. Kappos,_ 561 U.S. 593, 658, 95 USPQ2d 1001, 1007 (2010) (quoting _Gottschalk v. Benson,_ 409 U.S. 63, 70, 175 USPQ 673, 676 (1972)). If such a transformation exists, the claims are likely to be significantly more than any recited judicial exception or to integrate any recited judicial exception into a practical application.

It is noted that while the transformation of an article is an important clue, it is not a stand-alone test for eligibility. _Id._

All claims must be evaluated for eligibility using the two-part test from _Alice/Mayo_. If a claim passes the _Alice/Mayo_ test (_i.e.,_ is not directed to an exception at Step 2A, or amounts to significantly more than any recited exception in Step 2B), then the claim is eligible even if it "fails" the M-or-T test. _Bilski v. Kappos,_ 561 U.S. 593, 604, 95 USPQ2d 1001, 1007 (2010) (explaining that a claim may be eligible even if it does not satisfy the M-or-T test); _McRO, Inc. v. Bandai Namco Games Am. Inc.,_ 837 F.3d 1299, 1315, 120 USPQ2d 1091, 1102 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("[T]here is nothing that requires a method ‘be tied to a machine or transform an article’ to be patentable"). And if a claim fails the _Alice/Mayo_ test (_i.e.,_ is directed to an exception at Step 2A and does not amount to significantly more than the exception in Step 2B), then the claim is ineligible even if it passes the M-or-T test. _DDR Holdings, LLC v. Hotels.com, L.P.,_ 773 F.3d 1245, 1256, 113 USPQ2d 1097, 1104 (Fed. Cir. 2014) ("[I]n _Mayo,_ the Supreme Court emphasized that satisfying the machine-or-transformation test, by itself, is not sufficient to render a claim patent-eligible, as not all transformations or machine implementations infuse an otherwise ineligible claim with an "inventive concept.").

Examiners may find it helpful to evaluate other considerations such as the mere instructions to apply an exception consideration (see **[MPEP § 2106.05(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13da8_a5.html)**), the insignificant extra-solution activity consideration (see **[MPEP § 2106.05(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13df8_3d4.html)**), and the field of use and technological environment consideration (see **[MPEP § 2106.05(h)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13e1a_22c.html)**), when making a determination of whether a claim satisfies the particular transformation consideration.

An "article" includes a physical object or substance. The physical object or substance must be particular, meaning it can be specifically identified. "Transformation" of an article means that the "article" has changed to a different state or thing. Changing to a different state or thing usually means more than simply using an article or changing the location of an article. A new or different function or use can be evidence that an article has been transformed. Purely mental processes in which thoughts or human based actions are "changed" are not considered an eligible transformation. For data, mere "manipulation of basic mathematical constructs [i.e.,] the paradigmatic ‘abstract idea,’" has not been deemed a transformation. _CyberSource v. Retail Decisions,_ 654 F.3d 1366, 1372 n.2, 99 USPQ2d 1690, 1695 n.2 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (quoting _In re Warmerdam,_ 33 F.3d 1354, 1355, 1360, 31 USPQ2d 1754, 1755, 1759 (Fed. Cir. 1994)).

_Tilghman v. Proctor,_ 102 U.S. 707 (1881), provides an example of effecting a transformation of a particular article to a different state or thing. In that case, the claim was directed to a process of subjecting a mixture of fat and water to a high degree of heat and included additional parameters relating to the level of heat, the quantities of fat and water, and the strength of the mixing vessel. The claimed process, which used the natural principle that the elements of neutral fat require that they be severally united with an atomic equivalent of water in order to separate and become free, resulted in the transformation of the fatty bodies into fat acids and glycerine. _Id. at 729_.

Where a transformation is recited in a claim, the following factors are relevant to the analysis:

- 1. **The particularity or generality of the transformation.** According to the Supreme Court, inventions comprising processes of "‘tanning, dyeing, making waterproof cloth, vulcanizing India rubber [or] smelting ores’ . . . are instances . . . where the use of chemical substances or physical acts, such as temperature control, changes articles or materials [in such a manner that is] sufficiently definite to confine the patent monopoly within rather definite bounds." _Gottschalk v. Benson,_ 409 U.S. 63, 70, 175 USPQ 673, 676 (1972) (discussing _Corning v. Burden,_ 15 How. (56 U.S.) 252, 267-68 (1854)). Therefore, a more particular transformation would likely provide significantly more.
- 2. **The degree to which the recited article is particular.** A transformation applied to a generically recited article or to any and all articles would likely not provide significantly more than the judicial exception. A transformation that can be specifically identified, or that applies to only particular articles, is more likely to provide significantly more (or integrates a judicial exception into a practical application).
- 3. **The nature of the transformation in terms of the type or extent of change in state or thing.** A transformation resulting in the transformed article having a different function or use, would likely provide significantly more, but a transformation resulting in the transformed article merely having a different location, would likely not provide significantly more (or integrate a judicial exception into a practical application). For example, a process that transforms raw, uncured synthetic rubber into precision-molded synthetic rubber products, as discussed in _Diamond v. Diehr,_ 450 U.S. 175, 184, 209 USPQ 1, 21 (1981)), provides significantly more (or integrate a judicial exception into a practical application).
- 4. **The nature of the article transformed.** Transformation of a physical or tangible object or substance is more likely to provide significantly more (or integrate a judicial exception into a practical application) than the transformation of an intangible concept such as a contractual obligation or mental judgment.
- 5. **Whether the transformation is extra-solution activity or a field-of-use (_i.e.,_ the extent to which (or how) the transformation imposes meaningful limits on the execution of the claimed method steps).** A transformation that contributes only nominally or insignificantly to the execution of the claimed method (_e.g.,_ in a data gathering step or in a field-of-use limitation) would not provide significantly more (or integrate a judicial exception into a practical application). For example, in _Mayo_ the Supreme Court found claims regarding calibrating the proper dosage of thiopurine drugs to be patent ineligible subject matter. The Federal Circuit had held that the step of administering the thiopurine drug demonstrated a transformation of the human body and blood. _Mayo,_ 566 U.S. at 76, 101 USPQ2d at 1967. The Supreme Court disagreed, finding that this step was only a field-of-use limitation and did not provide significantly more than the judicial exception. _Id._ See **[MPEP § 2106.05(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13df8_3d4.html)** **[& (h)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13e1a_22c.html)** for more information on insignificant extra-solution activity and field of use, respectively.

# 2106.05(d)    Well-Understood, Routine, Conventional Activity [R-07.2022]

Another consideration when determining whether a claim recites significantly more than a judicial exception is whether the additional element(s) are well-understood, routine, conventional activities previously known to the industry. This consideration is only evaluated in Step 2B of the eligibility analysis.

If the additional element (or combination of elements) is a specific limitation other than what is well-understood, routine and conventional in the field, for instance because it is an unconventional step that confines the claim to a particular useful application of the judicial exception, then this consideration favors eligibility. If, however, the additional element (or combination of elements) is no more than well-understood, routine, conventional activities previously known to the industry, which is recited at a high level of generality, then this consideration does not favor eligibility.

_DDR Holdings, LLC v. Hotels.com, L.P.,_ 773 F.3d 1245, 113 USPQ2d 1097 (Fed. Cir. 2014), provides an example of additional elements that favored eligibility because they were more than well-understood, routine conventional activities in the field. The claims in _DDR Holdings_ were directed to systems and methods of generating a composite webpage that combines certain visual elements of a host website with the content of a third-party merchant. 773 F.3d at 1248, 113 USPQ2d at 1099. The court found that the claim had additional elements that amounted to significantly more than the abstract idea, because they modified conventional Internet hyperlink protocol to dynamically produce a dual-source hybrid webpage, which differed from the conventional operation of Internet hyperlink protocol that transported the user away from the host’s webpage to the third party’s webpage when the hyperlink was activated. 773 F.3d at 1258-59, 113 USPQ2d at 1106-07. Thus, the claims in _DDR Holdings_ were eligible.

On the other hand, _Mayo Collaborative Servs. v. Prometheus Labs.,_ Inc., 566 U.S. 66, 67, 101 USPQ2d 1961, 1964 (2010) provides an example of additional elements that were not an inventive concept because they were merely well-understood, routine, conventional activity previously known to the industry, which were not by themselves sufficient to transform a judicial exception into a patent eligible invention. _Mayo Collaborative Servs. v. Prometheus Labs., Inc.,_ 566 U.S. 66, 79-80, 101 USPQ2d 1969 (2012) (citing _Parker v. Flook,_ 437 U.S. 584, 590, 198 USPQ 193, 199 (1978) (the additional elements were "well known" and, thus, did not amount to a patentable application of the mathematical formula)). In _Mayo_, the claims at issue recited naturally occurring correlations (the relationships between the concentration in the blood of certain thiopurine metabolites and the likelihood that a drug dosage will be ineffective or induce harmful side effects) along with additional elements including telling a doctor to measure thiopurine metabolite levels in the blood using any known process. 566 U.S. at 77-79, 101 USPQ2d at 1967-68. The Court found this additional step of measuring metabolite levels to be well-understood, routine, conventional activity already engaged in by the scientific community because scientists "routinely measured metabolites as part of their investigations into the relationships between metabolite levels and efficacy and toxicity of thiopurine compounds." 566 U.S. at 79, 101 USPQ2d at 1968. Even when considered in combination with the other additional elements, the step of measuring metabolite levels did not amount to an inventive concept, and thus the claims in _Mayo_ were not eligible. 566 U.S. at 79-80, 101 USPQ2d at 1968-69.

## I.    **EVALUATING WHETHER THE ADDITIONAL ELEMENTS ARE WELL-UNDERSTOOD, ROUTINE, CONVENTIONAL ACTIVITY**

When making a determination whether the additional elements in a claim amount to significantly more than a judicial exception, the examiner should evaluate whether the elements define only well-understood, routine, conventional activity. In this respect, the well-understood, routine, conventional consideration overlaps with other Step 2B considerations, particularly the improvement consideration (see **[MPEP § 2106.05(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13c69_10.html)**), the mere instructions to apply an exception consideration (see **[MPEP § 2106.05(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13da8_a5.html)**), and the insignificant extra-solution activity consideration (see **[MPEP § 2106.05(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13df8_3d4.html)**). Thus, evaluation of those other considerations may assist examiners in making a determination of whether a particular element or combination of elements is well-understood, routine, conventional activity.

In addition, examiners should keep in mind the following points when determining whether additional elements define only well-understood, routine, conventional activity.

- 1. **An additional element (or combination of additional elements) that is known in the art can still be unconventional or non-routine.** The question of whether a particular claimed invention is novel or obvious is "fully apart" from the question of whether it is eligible. _Diamond v. Diehr,_ 450 U.S. 175, 190, 209 USPQ 1, 9 (1981). For example, claims may exhibit an improvement over conventional computer functionality even if the improvement lacks novelty over the prior art. Compare, _e.g.,_ _Enfish, LLC v. Microsoft Corp.,_ 822 F.3d 1327, 118 USPQ2d 1684 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (holding several claims from U.S. Patent Nos. 6,151,604 and 6,163,775 eligible) with _Microsoft Corp. v. Enfish, LLC,_ 662 Fed. App'x 981 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (holding some of the same claims to be anticipated by prior art). The eligible claims in _Enfish_ recited a self-referential database having two key features: all entity types can be stored in a single table; and the table rows can contain information defining the table columns. _Enfish,_ 822 F.3d at 1332, 118 USPQ2d at 1687. Although these features were taught by a single prior art reference (thus anticipating the claims), _Microsoft Corp.,_ 662 Fed. App'x at 986, the features were not conventional and thus were considered to reflect an improvement to existing technology. In particular, they enabled the claimed table to achieve benefits over conventional databases, such as increased flexibility, faster search times, and smaller memory requirements. _Enfish,_ 822 F.3d at 1337, 118 USPQ2d at 1690.
- 2. **A factual determination is required to support a conclusion that an additional element (or combination of additional elements) is well-understood, routine, conventional activity.** _Berkheimer v. HP, Inc.,_ 881 F.3d 1360, 1368, 125 USPQ2d 1649, 1654 (Fed. Cir. 2018). However, this does not mean that a prior art search is necessary to resolve this inquiry. Instead, examiners should rely on what the courts have recognized, or those in the art would recognize, as elements that are well-understood, routine, conventional activity in the relevant field when making the required determination. For example, in many instances, the specification of the application may indicate that additional elements are well-known or conventional. See, _e.g., Intellectual Ventures v. Symantec,_ 838 F.3d 1307, 1317; 120 USPQ2d 1353, 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2016) ("The written description is particularly useful in determining what is well-known or conventional"); _Internet Patents Corp. v. Active Network, Inc.,_ 790 F.3d 1343, 1348, 115 USPQ2d 1414, 1418 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (relying on specification’s description of additional elements as "well-known", "common" and "conventional"); _TLI Communications LLC v. AV Auto. LLC,_ 823 F.3d 607, 614, 118 USPQ2d 1744, 1748 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (Specification described additional elements as "either performing basic computer functions such as sending and receiving data, or performing functions ‘known’ in the art.").
    
    As such, an examiner should determine that an element (or combination of elements) is well-understood, routine, conventional activity only when the examiner can readily conclude, based on their expertise in the art, that the element is widely prevalent or in common use in the relevant industry. The analysis as to whether an element (or combination of elements) is widely prevalent or in common use is the same as the analysis under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**  as to whether an element is so well-known that it need not be described in detail in the patent specification. See _Genetic Techs. Ltd. v. Merial LLC,_ 818 F.3d 1369, 1377, 118 USPQ2d 1541, 1546 ( Fed. Cir. 2016) (supporting the position that amplification was well-understood, routine, conventional for purposes of subject matter eligibility by observing that the patentee expressly argued during prosecution of the application that amplification was a technique readily practiced by those skilled in the art to overcome the rejection of the claim under **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824.html)**, first paragraph); see also _Lindemann Maschinenfabrik GMBH v. Am. Hoist & Derrick Co.,_ 730 F.2d 1452, 1463, 221 USPQ 481, 489 (Fed. Cir. 1984) ("[T]he specification need not disclose what is well known in the art."); _In re Myers,_ 410 F.2d 420, 424, 161 USPQ 668, 671 (CCPA 1969) ("A specification is directed to those skilled in the art and need not teach or point out in detail that which is well-known in the art."); _Exergen Corp.,_ 725 Fed. App’x. 959, 965 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (holding that "[l]ike indefiniteness, enablement, or obviousness, whether a claim is directed to patent eligible subject matter is a question of law based on underlying facts," and noting that the Supreme Court has recognized that "the inquiry 'might sometimes overlap' with other fact-intensive inquiries like novelty under **[35 U.S.C. § 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//al_d1fbe1_234ed_52.html)**"). If the element is not widely prevalent or in common use, or is otherwise beyond those elements recognized in the art or by the courts as being well-understood, routine or conventional, then the element will in most cases favor eligibility. For example, even if a particular technique (_e.g.,_ measuring blood glucose via an earring worn by a person with diabetes) would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art because it was discussed in several widely-read scientific journals or used by a few scientists, mere knowledge of the particular technique or use of the particular technique by a few scientists is not necessarily sufficient to make the use of the particular technique routine or conventional in the relevant field. The examiner in this situation would already know, based on the examiner's expertise in the field, that blood glucose is routinely and conventionally monitored by other techniques (_e.g.,_ via placing a small droplet of blood on a diagnostic test strip, or via an implanted insulin pump with a glucose sensor). Thus, the examiner would not need to perform a prior art search in order to determine that the particular claimed technique using the glucose-sensing earring was not well-understood, routine, conventional activity previously engaged in by scientists in the field.
    
    The required factual determination must be expressly supported in writing, as discussed in **[MPEP § 2106.07(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_14011_176.html)**. Appropriate forms of support include one or more of the following: (a) A citation to an express statement in the specification or to a statement made by an applicant during prosecution that demonstrates the well-understood, routine, conventional nature of the additional element(s); (b) A citation to one or more of the court decisions discussed in Subsection II below as noting the well-understood, routine, conventional nature of the additional element(s); (c) A citation to a publication that demonstrates the well-understood, routine, conventional nature of the additional element(s); and (d) A statement that the examiner is taking official notice of the well-understood, routine, conventional nature of the additional element(s). For more information on supporting a conclusion that an additional element (or combination of additional elements) is well-understood, routine, conventional activity, see **[MPEP § 2106.07(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_14011_176.html)**, subsection III.
    
- 3. **Even if one or more additional elements are well-understood, routine, conventional activity when considered individually, the combination of additional elements may amount to an inventive concept.** _Diamond v. Diehr,_ 450 U.S. at 188, 209 USPQ at 9 (1981) ("[A] new combination of steps in a process may be patentable even though all the constituents of the combination were well known and in common use before the combination was made."). For example, a microprocessor that performs mathematical calculations and a clock that produces time data may individually be generic computer components that perform merely generic computer functions, but when combined may perform functions that are not generic computer functions and thus be an inventive concept. See, _e.g. Rapid Litig. Mgmt. v. CellzDirect, Inc.,_ 827 F.3d 1042, 1051, 119 USPQ2d 1370, 1375 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (holding that while the additional steps of freezing and thawing hepatocytes were well known, repeating those steps, contrary to what was taught in the art, was not routine or conventional). For example, in _BASCOM,_ even though the court found that all of the additional elements in the claim recited generic computer network or Internet components, the elements in combination amounted to significantly more because of the non-conventional and non-generic arrangement that provided a technical improvement in the art. _BASCOM Global Internet Servs. v. AT&T Mobility LLC,_ 827 F.3d 1341, 1350-51, 119 USPQ2d 1236, 1243-44 (2016).

A rejection should only be made if an examiner relying on the examiner's expertise in the art can conclude in the Step 2B inquiry that the additional elements do not amount to significantly more (Step 2B: NO). If the elements or functions are beyond those recognized in the art or by the courts as being well‐understood, routine, conventional activity, then the elements or functions will in most cases amount to significantly more (Step 2B: YES). For more information on formulating a subject matter eligibility rejection involving well-understood, routine, conventional activity, see **[MPEP § 2106.07(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_14011_176.html)**.

## II.    **ELEMENTS THAT THE COURTS HAVE RECOGNIZED AS WELL-UNDERSTOOD, ROUTINE, CONVENTIONAL ACTIVITY IN PARTICULAR FIELDS**

Because examiners should rely on what the courts have recognized, or those of ordinary skill in the art would recognize, as elements that describe well‐understood, routine activities, the following section provides examples of elements that have been recognized by the courts as well-understood, routine, conventional activity in particular fields. It should be noted, however, that many of these examples failed to satisfy other considerations (_e.g.,_ because they were recited at a high level of generality and thus were mere instructions to apply an exception, or were insignificant extra-solution activity). Thus, examiners should carefully analyze additional elements in a claim with respect to all relevant Step 2B considerations, including this consideration, before making a conclusion as to whether they amount to an inventive concept.

The courts have recognized the following computer functions as well‐understood, routine, and conventional functions when they are claimed in a merely generic manner (_e.g.,_ at a high level of generality) or as insignificant extra-solution activity.

- i. Receiving or transmitting data over a network, _e.g.,_ using the Internet to gather data, _Symantec,_ 838 F.3d at 1321, 120 USPQ2d at 1362 (utilizing an intermediary computer to forward information); _TLI Communications LLC v. AV Auto. LLC,_ 823 F.3d 607, 610, 118 USPQ2d 1744, 1745 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (using a telephone for image transmission); _OIP Techs., Inc., v. Amazon.com, Inc.,_ 788 F.3d 1359, 1363, 115 USPQ2d 1090, 1093 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (sending messages over a network); _buySAFE, Inc. v. Google, Inc.,_ 765 F.3d 1350, 1355, 112 USPQ2d 1093, 1096 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (computer receives and sends information over a network); but see _DDR Holdings, LLC v. Hotels.com, L.P.,_ 773 F.3d 1245, 1258, 113 USPQ2d 1097, 1106 (Fed. Cir. 2014) ("Unlike the claims in _Ultramercial,_ the claims at issue here specify _**how**_ interactions with the Internet are manipulated to yield a desired result‐‐a result that overrides the routine and conventional sequence of events ordinarily triggered by the click of a hyperlink." (emphasis added));
- ii. Performing repetitive calculations, _Flook,_ 437 U.S. at 594, 198 USPQ2d at 199 (recomputing or readjusting alarm limit values); _Bancorp Services v. Sun Life,_ 687 F.3d 1266, 1278, 103 USPQ2d 1425, 1433 (Fed. Cir. 2012) ("The computer required by some of _Bancorp_’s claims is employed only for its most basic function, the performance of repetitive calculations, and as such does not impose meaningful limits on the scope of those claims.");
- iii. Electronic recordkeeping, _Alice Corp. Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank Int'l,_ 573 U.S. 208, 225, 110 USPQ2d 1984 (2014) (creating and maintaining "shadow accounts"); _Ultramercial,_ 772 F.3d at 716, 112 USPQ2d at 1755 (updating an activity log);
- iv. Storing and retrieving information in memory, _Versata Dev. Group, Inc. v. SAP Am., Inc.,_ 793 F.3d 1306, 1334, 115 USPQ2d 1681, 1701 (Fed. Cir. 2015); _OIP Techs.,_ 788 F.3d at 1363, 115 USPQ2d at 1092-93;
- v. Electronically scanning or extracting data from a physical document, _Content Extraction and Transmission, LLC v. Wells Fargo Bank,_ 776 F.3d 1343, 1348, 113 USPQ2d 1354, 1358 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (optical character recognition); and
- vi. A Web browser’s back and forward button functionality, _Internet Patent Corp. v. Active Network, Inc.,_ 790 F.3d 1343, 1348, 115 USPQ2d 1414, 1418 (Fed. Cir. 2015).

This listing is not meant to imply that all computer functions are well‐understood, routine, conventional activities, or that a claim reciting a generic computer component performing a generic computer function is necessarily ineligible. See e.g. _Amdocs (Israel), Ltd. v. Openet Telecom, Inc.,_ 841 F.3d 1288, 1316, 120 USPQ2d 1527, 1549 (Fed. Cir. 2016), _BASCOM Global Internet Servs. v. AT&T Mobility LLC,_ 827 F.3d 1341, 1348, 119 USPQ2d 1236, 1241 (Fed. Cir. 2016). Courts have held computer‐implemented processes not to be significantly more than an abstract idea (and thus ineligible) where the claim as a whole amounts to nothing more than generic computer functions merely used to implement an abstract idea, such as an idea that could be done by a human analog (i.e., by hand or by merely thinking). On the other hand, courts have held computer-implemented processes to be significantly more than an abstract idea (and thus eligible), where generic computer components are able in combination to perform functions that are not merely generic. _DDR Holdings, LLC v. Hotels.com, L.P.,_ 773 F.3d 1245, 1257-59, 113 USPQ2d 1097, 1105-07 (Fed. Cir. 2014).

The courts have recognized the following laboratory techniques as well-understood, routine, conventional activity in the life science arts when they are claimed in a merely generic manner (_e.g.,_ at a high level of generality) or as insignificant extra-solution activity:

- i. Determining the level of a biomarker in blood by any means, _Mayo,_ 566 U.S. at 79, 101 USPQ2d at 1968; _Cleveland Clinic Foundation v. True Health Diagnostics, LLC,_ 859 F.3d 1352, 1362, 123 USPQ2d 1081, 1088 (Fed. Cir. 2017);
- ii. Using polymerase chain reaction to amplify and detect DNA, _Genetic Techs. Ltd. v. Merial LLC,_ 818 F.3d 1369, 1376, 118 USPQ2d 1541, 1546 (Fed. Cir. 2016); _Ariosa Diagnostics, Inc. v. Sequenom, Inc.,_ 788 F.3d 1371, 1377, 115 USPQ2d 1152, 1157 (Fed. Cir. 2015);
- iii. Detecting DNA or enzymes in a sample, _Sequenom,_ 788 F.3d at 1377-78, 115 USPQ2d at 1157); _Cleveland Clinic Foundation_ 859 F.3d at 1362, 123 USPQ2d at 1088 (Fed. Cir. 2017);
- iv. Immunizing a patient against a disease, _Classen Immunotherapies, Inc. v. Biogen IDEC,_ 659 F.3d 1057, 1063, 100 USPQ2d 1492, 1497 (Fed. Cir. 2011);
- v. Analyzing DNA to provide sequence information or detect allelic variants, _Genetic Techs. Ltd.,_ 818 F.3d at 1377; 118 USPQ2d at 1546;
- vi. Freezing and thawing cells, _Rapid Litig. Mgmt._ 827 F.3d at 1051, 119 USPQ2d at 1375;
- vii. Amplifying and sequencing nucleic acid sequences, _University of Utah Research Foundation v. Ambry Genetics,_ 774 F.3d 755, 764, 113 USPQ2d 1241, 1247 (Fed. Cir. 2014); and
- viii. Hybridizing a gene probe, _Ambry Genetics,_ 774 F.3d at 764, 113 USPQ2d at 1247.

Below are examples of other types of activity that the courts have found to be well-understood, routine, conventional activity when they are claimed in a merely generic manner (_e.g.,_ at a high level of generality) or as insignificant extra-solution activity:

- i. Recording a customer’s order, _Apple, Inc. v. Ameranth, Inc.,_ 842 F.3d 1229, 1244, 120 USPQ2d 1844, 1856 (Fed. Cir. 2016);
- ii. Shuffling and dealing a standard deck of cards, _In re Smith,_ 815 F.3d 816, 819, 118 USPQ2d 1245, 1247 (Fed. Cir. 2016);
- iii. Restricting public access to media by requiring a consumer to view an advertisement, _Ultramercial, Inc. v. Hulu, LLC,_ 772 F.3d 709, 716-17, 112 USPQ2d 1750, 1755-56 (Fed. Cir. 2014);

- vi. Arranging a hierarchy of groups, sorting information, eliminating less restrictive pricing information and determining the price, _Versata Dev. Group, Inc. v. SAP Am., Inc.,_ 793 F.3d 1306, 1331, 115 USPQ2d 1681, 1699 (Fed. Cir. 2015).

# 2106.05(e)    Other Meaningful Limitations [R-10.2019]

The analysis of whether the claim includes other meaningful limitations may be relevant for both eligibility analysis Step 2A Prong Two, and Step 2B.

The claim should add meaningful limitations beyond generally linking the use of the judicial exception to a particular technological environment to transform the judicial exception into patent-eligible subject matter. The phrase "meaningful limitations" has been used by the courts even before Alice and Mayo in various contexts to describe additional elements that provide an inventive concept to the claim as a whole. The considerations described in **[MPEP § 2106.05(a)-(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13c69_10.html)** are meaningful limitations when they amount to significantly more than the judicial exception, or when they integrate a judicial exception into a practical application. This broad label signals that there can be other considerations besides those described in **[MPEP § 2106.05(a)-(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13c69_10.html)** that when added to a judicial exception amount to meaningful limitations that can transform a claim into patent-eligible subject matter.

_Diamond v. Diehr_ provides an example of a claim that recited meaningful limitations beyond generally linking the use of the judicial exception to a particular technological environment. 450 U.S. 175, 209 USPQ 1 (1981). In _Diehr,_ the claim was directed to the use of the Arrhenius equation (an abstract idea or law of nature) in an automated process for operating a rubber-molding press. 450 U.S. at 177-78, 209 USPQ at 4. The Court evaluated additional elements such as the steps of installing rubber in a press, closing the mold, constantly measuring the temperature in the mold, and automatically opening the press at the proper time, and found them to be meaningful because they sufficiently limited the use of the mathematical equation to the practical application of molding rubber products. 450 U.S. at 184, 187, 209 USPQ at 7, 8. In contrast, the claims in _Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International_ did not meaningfully limit the abstract idea of mitigating settlement risk. 573 U.S. 208, 110 USPQ2d 1976 (2014). In particular, the Court concluded that the additional elements such as the data processing system and communications controllers recited in the system claims did not meaningfully limit the abstract idea because they merely linked the use of the abstract idea to a particular technological environment (i.e., "implementation via computers") or were well-understood, routine, conventional activity recited at a high level of generality. 573 U.S. at 225-26, 110 USPQ2d at 1984-85.

_Classen Immunotherapies Inc. v. Biogen IDEC_ provides another example of claims that recited meaningful limitations. 659 F.3d 1057, 100 USPQ2d 1492 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (decision on remand from the Supreme Court, which had vacated the lower court’s prior holding of ineligibility in view of _Bilski v. Kappos_, 561 U.S. 593, 95 USPQ2d 1001 (2010)). In _Classen,_ the claims recited methods that gathered and analyzed the effects of particular immunization schedules on the later development of chronic immune-mediated disorders in mammals in order to identify a lower risk immunization schedule, and then immunized mammalian subjects in accordance with the identified lower risk schedule (thereby lowering the risk that the immunized subject would later develop chronic immune-mediated diseases). 659 F.3d at 1060-61; 100 USPQ2d at 1495-96. Although the analysis step was an abstract mental process that collected and compared known information, the immunization step was meaningful because it integrated the results of the analysis into a specific and tangible method that resulted in the method "moving from abstract scientific principle to specific application." 659 F.3d at 1066-68; 100 USPQ2d at 1500-01. In contrast, in _OIP Technologies, Inc. v. Amazon.com, Inc.,_ the court determined that the additional steps to "test prices and collect data based on the customer reactions" did not meaningfully limit the abstract idea of offer-based price optimization, because the steps were well-understood, routine, conventional data-gathering activities. 788 F.3d 1359, 1363-64, 115 USPQ2d 1090, 1093 (Fed. Cir. 2015).

With respect to treatment or prophylaxis limitations, such as the immunization step in _Classen,_ examiners should note that the other meaningful limitations consideration overlaps with the particular treatment or prophylaxis consideration that is evaluated in Step 2A Prong Two (see **[MPEP § 2106.04(d)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d2e827_17196_6c.html)**).

When evaluating whether additional elements meaningfully limit the judicial exception, it is particularly critical that examiners consider the additional elements both individually and as a combination. When an additional element is considered individually by an examiner, the additional element may be enough to qualify as "significantly more" if it meaningfully limits the judicial exception, and may also add a meaningful limitation by integrating the judicial exception into a practical application. However, even in the situation where the individually-viewed elements do not add significantly more or integrate the exception, those additional elements when viewed in combination may render the claim eligible. See _Diamond v. Diehr,_ 450 U.S. 175, 188, 209 USPQ2d 1, 9 (1981) ("a new combination of steps in a process may be patentable even though all the constituents of the combination were well known and in common use before the combination was made"); _BASCOM Global Internet Servs. v. AT&T Mobility LLC,_ 827 F.3d 1341, 1349, 119 USPQ2d 1236, 1242 (Fed. Cir. 2016). It is important to note that, when appropriate, an examiner may explain on the record why the additional elements meaningfully limit the judicial exception.

# 2106.05(f)    Mere Instructions To Apply An Exception [R-10.2019]

Another consideration when determining whether a claim integrates a judicial exception into a practical application in Step 2A Prong Two or recites significantly more than a judicial exception in Step 2B is whether the additional elements amount to more than a recitation of the words "apply it" (or an equivalent) or are more than mere instructions to implement an abstract idea or other exception on a computer. As explained by the Supreme Court, in order to make a claim directed to a judicial exception patent-eligible, the additional element or combination of elements must do "‘more than simply stat[e] the [judicial exception] while adding the words ‘apply it’". _Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank,_ 573 U.S. 208, 221, 110 USPQ2d 1976, 1982-83 (2014) (quoting _Mayo Collaborative Servs. V. Prometheus Labs., Inc.,_ 566 U.S. 66, 72, 101 USPQ2d 1961, 1965). Thus, for example, claims that amount to nothing more than an instruction to apply the abstract idea using a generic computer do not render an abstract idea eligible. _Alice Corp.,_ 573 U.S. at 223, 110 USPQ2d at 1983. See also 573 U.S. at 224, 110 USPQ2d at 1984 (warning against a **[§ 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  analysis that turns on "the draftsman’s art").

The Supreme Court has identified additional elements as mere instructions to apply an exception in several cases. For instance, in _Mayo_, the Supreme Court concluded that a step of determining thiopurine metabolite levels in patients’ blood did not amount to significantly more than the recited laws of nature, because this additional element simply instructed doctors to apply the laws by measuring the metabolites in any way the doctors (or medical laboratories) chose to use. 566 U.S. at 79, 101 USPQ2d at 1968. In _Alice Corp.,_ the claim recited the concept of intermediated settlement as performed by a generic computer. The Court found that the recitation of the computer in the claim amounted to mere instructions to apply the abstract idea on a generic computer. 573 U.S. at 225-26, 110 USPQ2d at 1984. The Supreme Court also discussed this concept in an earlier case, _Gottschalk v. Benson,_ 409 U.S. 63, 70, 175 USPQ 673, 676 (1972), where the claim recited a process for converting binary-coded-decimal (BCD) numerals into pure binary numbers. The Court found that the claimed process had no meaningful practical application except in connection with a computer. _Benson,_ 409 U.S. at 71-72, 175 USPQ at 676. The claim simply stated a judicial exception (_e.g.,_ law of nature or abstract idea) while effectively adding words that "apply it" in a computer. _Id._

Requiring more than mere instructions to apply an exception does not mean that the claim must be narrow in order to be eligible. The courts have identified some broad claims as eligible see, _e.g.,_ _McRO, Inc. v. Bandai Namco Games Am. Inc.,_ 837 F.3d 1299, 120 USPQ2d 1091 (Fed. Cir. 2016); _Thales Visionix Inc. v. United States,_ 850 F.3d. 1343, 121 USPQ2d 1898 (Fed. Cir. 2017), and some narrow claims as ineligible see _e.g.,_ _Ultramercial, Inc. v. Hulu, LLC,_ 772 F.3d 709, 112 USPQ2d 1750 (Fed. Cir. 2014); _Electric Power Group, LLC v. Alstom, S.A.,_ 830 F.3d 1350, 119 USPQ2d 1739 (Fed. Cir. 2016). Thus, examiners should carefully consider each claim on its own merits, as well as evaluate all other relevant considerations, before making a determination of whether an element (or combination of elements) is more than mere instructions to apply an exception. For example, because this consideration often overlaps with the improvement consideration (see **[MPEP § 2106.05(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13c69_10.html)**), the particular machine and particular transformation considerations (see **[MPEP § 2106.05(b) and (c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13ccf_18c.html)**, respectively), and the well-understood, routine, conventional consideration (see **[MPEP § 2106.05(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13d41_124.html)**), evaluation of those other considerations may assist examiners in making a determination of whether an element (or combination of elements) is more than mere instructions to apply an exception. Note, however, that examiners should not evaluate the well-understood, routine, conventional consideration in the Step 2A Prong Two analysis, because that consideration is only evaluated in Step 2B.

For claim limitations that do not amount to more than a recitation of the words "apply it" (or an equivalent), such as mere instructions to implement an abstract idea on a computer, examiners should explain why they do not meaningfully limit the claim in an eligibility rejection. For example, an examiner could explain that implementing an abstract idea on a generic computer, does not integrate the abstract idea into a practical application in Step 2A Prong Two or add significantly more in Step 2B, similar to how the recitation of the computer in the claim in _Alice_ amounted to mere instructions to apply the abstract idea of intermediated settlement on a generic computer. For more information on formulating a subject matter eligibility rejection. See **[MPEP § 2106.07(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_14011_176.html)**.

When determining whether a claim simply recites a judicial exception with the words "apply it" (or an equivalent), such as mere instructions to implement an abstract idea on a computer, examiners may consider the following:

**(1) Whether the claim recites only the idea of a solution or outcome _i.e.,_ the claim fails to recite details of how a solution to a problem is accomplished.** The recitation of claim limitations that attempt to cover any solution to an identified problem with no restriction on how the result is accomplished and no description of the mechanism for accomplishing the result, does not integrate a judicial exception into a practical application or provide significantly more because this type of recitation is equivalent to the words "apply it". See _Electric Power Group, LLC v. Alstom, S.A.,_ 830 F.3d 1350, 1356, 119 USPQ2d 1739, 1743-44 (Fed. Cir. 2016); _Intellectual Ventures I v. Symantec,_ 838 F.3d 1307, 1327, 120 USPQ2d 1353, 1366 (Fed. Cir. 2016); _Internet Patents Corp. v. Active Network, Inc.,_ 790 F.3d 1343, 1348, 115 USPQ2d 1414, 1417 (Fed. Cir. 2015). In contrast, claiming a particular solution to a problem or a particular way to achieve a desired outcome may integrate the judicial exception into a practical application or provide significantly more. See _Electric Power,_ 830 F.3d at 1356, 119 USPQ2d at 1743.

By way of example, in _Intellectual Ventures I v. Capital One Fin. Corp.,_ 850 F.3d 1332, 121 USPQ2d 1940 (Fed. Cir. 2017), the steps in the claims described "the creation of a dynamic document based upon ‘management record types’ and ‘primary record types.’" 850 F.3d at 1339-40; 121 USPQ2d at 1945-46. The claims were found to be directed to the abstract idea of "collecting, displaying, and manipulating data." 850 F.3d at 1340; 121 USPQ2d at 1946. In addition to the abstract idea, the claims also recited the additional element of modifying the underlying XML document in response to modifications made in the dynamic document. 850 F.3d at 1342; 121 USPQ2d at 1947-48. Although the claims purported to modify the underlying XML document in response to modifications made in the dynamic document, nothing in the claims indicated what specific steps were undertaken other than merely using the abstract idea in the context of XML documents. The court thus held the claims ineligible, because the additional limitations provided only a result-oriented solution and lacked details as to how the computer performed the modifications, which was equivalent to the words "apply it". 850 F.3d at 1341-42; 121 USPQ2d at 1947-48 (citing _Electric Power Group.,_ 830 F.3d at 1356, 1356, USPQ2d at 1743-44 (cautioning against claims "so result focused, so functional, as to effectively cover any solution to an identified problem")).

Other examples where the courts have found the additional elements to be mere instructions to apply an exception, because they recite no more than an idea of a solution or outcome include:

- i. Remotely accessing user-specific information through a mobile interface and pointers to retrieve the information without any description of how the mobile interface and pointers accomplish the result of retrieving previously inaccessible information, _Intellectual Ventures v. Erie Indem. Co.,_ 850 F.3d 1315, 1331, 121 USPQ2d 1928, 1939 (Fed. Cir. 2017);
- ii. A general method of screening emails on a generic computer without any limitations that addressed the issues of shrinking the protection gap and mooting the volume problem, _Intellectual Ventures I v. Symantec Corp.,_ 838 F.3d 1307, 1319, 120 USPQ2d 1353, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2016); and
- iii. Wireless delivery of out-of-region broadcasting content to a cellular telephone via a network without any details of how the delivery is accomplished, _Affinity Labs of Texas v. DirecTV, LLC,_ 838 F.3d 1253, 1262-63, 120 USPQ2d 1201, 1207 (Fed. Cir. 2016).

In contrast, other cases have found that additional elements are more than "apply it" or are not "mere instructions" when the claim recites a technological solution to a technological problem. In _DDR Holdings,_ the court found that the additional elements did amount to more than merely instructing that the abstract idea should be applied on the Internet. _DDR Holdings, LLC v. Hotels.com, L.P.,_ 773 F.3d 1245, 1259, 113 USPQ2d 1097, 1107 (Fed. Cir. 2014). The claims at issue specified how interactions with the Internet were manipulated to yield a desired result—a result that overrode the routine and conventional sequence of events ordinarily triggered by the click of a hyperlink. 773 F.3d at 1258; 113 USPQ2d at 1106. In _BASCOM,_ the court determined that the claimed combination of limitations did not simply recite an instruction to apply the abstract idea of filtering content on the Internet. _BASCOM Global Internet Servs. v. AT&T Mobility, LLC,_ 827 F.3d 1341, 1350, 119 USPQ2d 1236, 1243 (Fed. Cir. 2016). Instead, the claim recited a "technology based solution" of filtering content on the Internet that overcome the disadvantages of prior art filtering systems. 827 F.3d at 1350-51, 119 USPQ2d at 1243. Finally, in _Thales Visionix,_ the particular configuration of inertial sensors and the particular method of using the raw data from the sensors was more than simply applying a law of nature. _Thales Visionix, Inc. v. United States,_ 850 F.3d 1343, 1348-49, 121 USPQ2d 1898, 1902 (Fed. Cir. 2017). The court found that the claims provided a system and method that "eliminate[d] many ‘complications’ inherent in previous solutions for determining position and orientation of an object on a moving platform." In other words, the claim recited a technological solution to a technological problem. _Id._

**(2) Whether the claim invokes computers or other machinery merely as a tool to perform an existing process.** Use of a computer or other machinery in its ordinary capacity for economic or other tasks (_e.g.,_ to receive, store, or transmit data) or simply adding a general purpose computer or computer components after the fact to an abstract idea (_e.g.,_ a fundamental economic practice or mathematical equation) does not integrate a judicial exception into a practical application or provide significantly more. See _Affinity Labs v. DirecTV,_ 838 F.3d 1253, 1262, 120 USPQ2d 1201, 1207 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (cellular telephone); _TLI Communications LLC v. AV Auto, LLC,_ 823 F.3d 607, 613, 118 USPQ2d 1744, 1748 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (computer server and telephone unit). Similarly, "claiming the improved speed or efficiency inherent with applying the abstract idea on a computer" does not integrate a judicial exception into a practical application or provide an inventive concept. _Intellectual Ventures I LLC v. Capital One Bank (USA),_ 792 F.3d 1363, 1367, 115 USPQ2d 1636, 1639 (Fed. Cir. 2015). In contrast, a claim that purports to improve computer capabilities or to improve an existing technology may integrate a judicial exception into a practical application or provide significantly more. _McRO, Inc. v. Bandai Namco Games Am. Inc.,_ 837 F.3d 1299, 1314-15, 120 USPQ2d 1091, 1101-02 (Fed. Cir. 2016); _Enfish, LLC v. Microsoft Corp.,_ 822 F.3d 1327, 1335-36, 118 USPQ2d 1684, 1688-89 (Fed. Cir. 2016). See **[MPEP §§ 2106.04(d)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d2e7df_24a6e_1bd.html)** and **[2106.05(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13c69_10.html)** for a discussion of improvements to the functioning of a computer or to another technology or technical field.

_TLI Communications_ provides an example of a claim invoking computers and other machinery merely as a tool to perform an existing process. The court stated that the claims describe steps of recording, administration and archiving of digital images, and found them to be directed to the abstract idea of classifying and storing digital images in an organized manner. 823 F.3d at 612, 118 USPQ2d at 1747. The court then turned to the additional elements of performing these functions using a telephone unit and a server and noted that these elements were being used in their ordinary capacity (_i.e.,_ the telephone unit is used to make calls and operate as a digital camera including compressing images and transmitting those images, and the server simply receives data, extracts classification information from the received data, and stores the digital images based on the extracted information). 823 F.3d at 612-13, 118 USPQ2d at 1747-48. In other words, the claims invoked the telephone unit and server merely as tools to execute the abstract idea. Thus, the court found that the additional elements did not add significantly more to the abstract idea because they were simply applying the abstract idea on a telephone network without any recitation of details of how to carry out the abstract idea.

Other examples where the courts have found the additional elements to be mere instructions to apply an exception, because they do no more than merely invoke computers or machinery as a tool to perform an existing process include:

- i. A commonplace business method or mathematical algorithm being applied on a general purpose computer, _Alice Corp. Pty. Ltd. V. CLS Bank Int’l,_ 573 U.S. 208, 223, 110 USPQ2d 1976, 1983 (2014); _Gottschalk v. Benson,_ 409 U.S. 63, 64, 175 USPQ 673, 674 (1972); _Versata Dev. Group, Inc. v. SAP Am., Inc.,_ 793 F.3d 1306, 1334, 115 USPQ2d 1681, 1701 (Fed. Cir. 2015);
- ii. Generating a second menu from a first menu and sending the second menu to another location as performed by generic computer components, _Apple, Inc. v. Ameranth, Inc.,_ 842 F.3d 1229, 1243-44, 120 USPQ2d 1844, 1855-57 (Fed. Cir. 2016);
- iii. A process for monitoring audit log data that is executed on a general-purpose computer where the increased speed in the process comes solely from the capabilities of the general-purpose computer, _FairWarning IP, LLC v. Iatric Sys.,_ 839 F.3d 1089, 1095, 120 USPQ2d 1293, 1296 (Fed. Cir. 2016);
- iv. A method of using advertising as an exchange or currency being applied or implemented on the Internet, _Ultramercial, Inc. v. Hulu, LLC,_ 772 F.3d 709, 715, 112 USPQ2d 1750, 1754 (Fed. Cir. 2014);
- v. Requiring the use of software to tailor information and provide it to the user on a generic computer, _Intellectual Ventures I LLC v. Capital One Bank (USA),_ 792 F.3d 1363, 1370-71, 115 USPQ2d 1636, 1642 (Fed. Cir. 2015); and
- vi. A method of assigning hair designs to balance head shape with a final step of using a tool (scissors) to cut the hair, _In re Brown,_ 645 Fed. App'x 1014, 1017 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (non-precedential).

**(3) The particularity or generality of the application of the judicial exception.** A claim having broad applicability across many fields of endeavor may not provide meaningful limitations that integrate a judicial exception into a practical application or amount to significantly more. For instance, a claim that generically recites an effect of the judicial exception or claims every mode of accomplishing that effect, amounts to a claim that is merely adding the words "apply it" to the judicial exception. See _Internet Patents Corporation v. Active Network, Inc.,_ 790 F.3d 1343, 1348, 115 USPQ2d 1414, 1418 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (The recitation of maintaining the state of data in an online form without restriction on how the state is maintained and with no description of the mechanism for maintaining the state describes "the effect or result dissociated from any method by which maintaining the state is accomplished" and does not provide a meaningful limitation because it merely states that the abstract idea should be applied to achieve a desired result). See also _O’Reilly v. Morse,_ 56 U.S. 62 (1854) (finding ineligible a claim for "the use of electromagnetism for transmitting signals at a distance"); The _Telephone Cases,_ 126 U.S. 1, 209 (1888) (finding a method of "transmitting vocal or other sound telegraphically ... by causing electrical undulations, similar in form to the vibrations of the air accompanying the said vocal or other sounds," to be ineligible, because it "monopolize[d] a natural force" and "the right to avail of that law by any means whatever.").

In contrast, limitations that confine the judicial exception to a particular, practical application of the judicial exception may amount to significantly more or integrate the judicial exception into a practical application. For example, in _BASCOM,_ the combination of additional elements, and specifically "the installation of a filtering tool at a specific location, remote from the end‐users, with customizable filtering features specific to each end user" where the filtering tool at the ISP was able to "identify individual accounts that communicate with the ISP server, and to associate a request for Internet content with a specific individual account," were held to be meaningful limitations because they confined the abstract idea of content filtering to a particular, practical application of the abstract idea. 827 F.3d at 1350-51, 119 USPQ2d at 1243.

# 2106.05(g)    Insignificant Extra-Solution Activity [R-10.2019]

Another consideration when determining whether a claim integrates the judicial exception into a practical application in Step 2A Prong Two or recites significantly more in Step 2B is whether the additional elements add more than insignificant extra-solution activity to the judicial exception. The term "extra-solution activity" can be understood as activities incidental to the primary process or product that are merely a nominal or tangential addition to the claim. Extra-solution activity includes both pre-solution and post-solution activity. An example of pre-solution activity is a step of gathering data for use in a claimed process, _e.g.,_ a step of obtaining information about credit card transactions, which is recited as part of a claimed process of analyzing and manipulating the gathered information by a series of steps in order to detect whether the transactions were fraudulent. An example of post-solution activity is an element that is not integrated into the claim as a whole, _e.g.,_ a printer that is used to output a report of fraudulent transactions, which is recited in a claim to a computer programmed to analyze and manipulate information about credit card transactions in order to detect whether the transactions were fraudulent.

As explained by the Supreme Court, the addition of insignificant extra-solution activity does not amount to an inventive concept, particularly when the activity is well-understood or conventional. _Parker v. Flook,_ 437 U.S. 584, 588-89, 198 USPQ 193, 196 (1978). In _Flook,_ the Court reasoned that "[t]he notion that post-solution activity, no matter how conventional or obvious in itself, can transform an unpatentable principle into a patentable process exalts form over substance. A competent draftsman could attach some form of post-solution activity to almost any mathematical formula". 437 U.S. at 590; 198 USPQ at 197; _Id._ (holding that step of adjusting an alarm limit variable to a figure computed according to a mathematical formula was "post-solution activity"). See also _Mayo Collaborative Servs. v. Prometheus Labs. Inc.,_ 566 U.S. 66, 79, 101 USPQ2d 1961, 1968 (2012) (additional element of measuring metabolites of a drug administered to a patient was insignificant extra-solution activity).

Examiners should carefully consider each claim on its own merits, as well as evaluate all other relevant considerations, before making a determination of whether an element (or combination of elements) is insignificant extra-solution activity. In particular, evaluation of the particular machine and particular transformation considerations (see **[MPEP § 2106.05(b) and (c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13ccf_18c.html)**, respectively), the well-understood, routine, conventional consideration (see **[MPEP § 2106.05(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13d41_124.html)**), and the field of use and technological environment consideration (see **[MPEP § 2106.05(h)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13e1a_22c.html)**) may assist examiners in making a determination of whether an element (or combination of elements) is insignificant extra-solution activity. Note, however, that examiners should not evaluate the well-understood, routine, conventional consideration in the Step 2A Prong Two analysis, because that consideration is only evaluated in Step 2B.

This consideration is similar to factors used in past Office guidance (for example, the now superseded _Bilski_ and _Mayo_ analyses) that were described as mere data gathering in conjunction with a law of nature or abstract idea. When determining whether an additional element is insignificant extra-solution activity, examiners may consider the following:

**(1) Whether the extra-solution limitation is well known.** See _Bilski v. Kappos,_ 561 U.S. 593, 611-12, 95 USPQ2d 1001, 1010 (2010) (well-known random analysis techniques to establish the inputs of an equation were token extra-solution activity); _Flook,_ 437 U.S. at 593-95, 198 USPQ at 197 (a formula would not be patentable by only indicating that is could be usefully applied to existing surveying techniques); _Intellectual Ventures I LLC v. Erie Indem. Co.,_ 850 F.3d 1315, 1328-29, 121 USPQ2d 1928, 1937 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (the use of a well-known XML tag to form an index was deemed token extra-solution activity). Because this overlaps with the well-understood, routine, conventional consideration, it should not be considered in the Step 2A Prong Two extra-solution activity analysis.

**(2) Whether the limitation is significant (_i.e._ it imposes meaningful limits on the claim such that it is not nominally or tangentially related to the invention).** See _Ultramercial, Inc. v. Hulu, LLC,_ 772 F.3d 709, 715-16, 112 USPQ2d 1750, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (restricting public access to media was found to be insignificant extra-solution activity); _Apple, Inc. v. Ameranth, Inc.,_ 842 F.3d 1229, 1242, 120 USPQ2d 1844, 1855 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (in patents regarding electronic menus, features related to types of ordering were found to be insignificant extra-solution activity). This is considered in Step 2A Prong Two and Step 2B.

**(3) Whether the limitation amounts to necessary data gathering and outputting, (_i.e.,_ all uses of the recited judicial exception require such data gathering or data output).** See _Mayo,_ 566 U.S. at 79, 101 USPQ2d at 1968; _OIP Techs., Inc. v. Amazon.com, Inc.,_ 788 F.3d 1359, 1363, 115 USPQ2d 1090, 1092-93 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (presenting offers and gathering statistics amounted to mere data gathering). This is considered in Step 2A Prong Two and Step 2B.

Below are examples of activities that the courts have found to be insignificant extra-solution activity:

- **• Mere Data Gathering:**
    - i. Performing clinical tests on individuals to obtain input for an equation, _In re Grams,_ 888 F.2d 835, 839-40; 12 USPQ2d 1824, 1827-28 (Fed. Cir. 1989);
    - ii. Testing a system for a response, the response being used to determine system malfunction, _In re Meyers,_ 688 F.2d 789, 794; 215 USPQ 193, 196-97 (CCPA 1982);
    - iii. Presenting offers to potential customers and gathering statistics generated based on the testing about how potential customers responded to the offers; the statistics are then used to calculate an optimized price, _OIP Technologies,_ 788 F.3d at 1363, 115 USPQ2d at 1092-93;
    - iv. Obtaining information about transactions using the Internet to verify credit card transactions, _CyberSource v. Retail Decisions, Inc.,_ 654 F.3d 1366, 1375, 99 USPQ2d 1690, 1694 (Fed. Cir. 2011);
    - v. Consulting and updating an activity log, _Ultramercial,_ 772 F.3d at 715, 112 USPQ2d at 1754; and
    - vi. Determining the level of a biomarker in blood, _Mayo,_ 566 U.S. at 79, 101 USPQ2d at 1968. See also _PerkinElmer, Inc. v. Intema Ltd.,_ 496 Fed. App'x 65, 73, 105 USPQ2d 1960, 1966 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (assessing or measuring data derived from an ultrasound scan, to be used in a diagnosis).
- **• Selecting a particular data source or type of data to be manipulated:**
    - i. Limiting a database index to XML tags, _Intellectual Ventures I LLC v. Erie Indem. Co.,_ 850 F.3d at 1328-29, 121 USPQ2d at 1937;
    - ii. Taking food orders from only table-based customers or drive-through customers, _Ameranth,_ 842 F.3d at 1241-43, 120 USPQ2d at 1854-55;
    - iii. Selecting information, based on types of information and availability of information in a power-grid environment, for collection, analysis and display, _Electric Power Group, LLC v. Alstom S.A.,_ 830 F.3d 1350, 1354-55, 119 USPQ2d 1739, 1742 (Fed. Cir. 2016); and
    - iv. Requiring a request from a user to view an advertisement and restricting public access, _Ultramercial,_ 772 F.3d at 715-16, 112 USPQ2d at 1754.
- **• Insignificant application:**
    - i. Cutting hair after first determining the hair style, _In re Brown,_ 645 Fed. App'x 1014, 1016-1017 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (non-precedential); and
    - ii. Printing or downloading generated menus, _Ameranth,_ 842 F.3d at 1241-42, 120 USPQ2d at 1854-55.

Some cases have identified insignificant computer implementation as an example of insignificant extra-solution activity. See _e.g., Fort Props., Inc. v. Am. Master Lease LLC,_ 671 F.3d 1317, 1323-24, 101 USPQ2d 1785, 1789-90 (Fed. Cir. 2012); _Bancorp Servs., LLC v. Sun Life Assur. Co. of Canada,_ 687 F.3d 1266, 1280-81, 103 USPQ2d 1425, 1434-35 (Fed. Cir. 2012). Other cases have considered these types of limitations as mere instructions to apply a judicial exception. See **[MPEP § 2106.05(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13da8_a5.html)** for more information about insignificant computer implementation.

For claim limitations that add insignificant extra-solution activity to the judicial exception (_e.g.,_ mere data gathering in conjunction with a law of nature or abstract idea), examiners should explain in an eligibility rejection why they do not meaningfully limit the claim. For example, an examiner could explain that adding a final step of storing data to a process that only recites computing the area of a space (a mathematical relationship) does not add a meaningful limitation to the process of computing the area. For more information on formulating a subject matter eligibility rejection, see **[MPEP § 2106.07(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_14011_176.html)**.

# 2106.05(h)    Field of Use and Technological Environment [R-10.2019]

Another consideration when determining whether a claim integrates the judicial exception into a practical application in Step 2A Prong Two or recites significantly more than a judicial exception in Step 2B is whether the additional elements amount to more than generally linking the use of a judicial exception to a particular technological environment or field of use. As explained by the Supreme Court, a claim directed to a judicial exception cannot be made eligible "simply by having the applicant acquiesce to limiting the reach of the patent for the formula to a particular technological use." _Diamond v. Diehr,_ 450 U.S. 175, 192 n.14, 209 USPQ 1, 10 n. 14 (1981). Thus, limitations that amount to merely indicating a field of use or technological environment in which to apply a judicial exception do not amount to significantly more than the exception itself, and cannot integrate a judicial exception into a practical application.

The courts often cite to _Parker v. Flook_ as providing a classic example of a field of use limitation. See, _e.g., Bilski v. Kappos,_ 561 U.S. 593, 612, 95 USPQ2d 1001, 1010 (2010) ("_Flook_ established that limiting an abstract idea to one field of use or adding token postsolution components did not make the concept patentable") (citing _Parker v. Flook,_ 437 U.S. 584, 198 USPQ 193 (1978)). In _Flook,_ the claim recited steps of calculating an updated value for an alarm limit (a numerical limit on a process variable such as temperature, pressure or flow rate) according to a mathematical formula "in a process comprising the catalytic chemical conversion of hydrocarbons." 437 U.S. at 586, 198 USPQ at 196. Processes for the catalytic chemical conversion of hydrocarbons were used in the petrochemical and oil-refining fields. _Id._ Although the applicant argued that limiting the use of the formula to the petrochemical and oil-refining fields should make the claim eligible because this limitation ensured that the claim did not preempt all uses of the formula, the Supreme Court disagreed. 437 U.S. at 588-90, 198 USPQ at 197-98. Instead, the additional element in _Flook_ regarding the catalytic chemical conversion of hydrocarbons was not sufficient to make the claim eligible, because it was merely an incidental or token addition to the claim that did not alter or affect how the process steps of calculating the alarm limit value were performed. Further, the Supreme Court found that this limitation did not amount to an inventive concept. 437 U.S. at 588-90, 198 USPQ at 197-98. The Court reasoned that to hold otherwise would "exalt[] form over substance", because a competent claim drafter could attach a similar type of limitation to almost any mathematical formula. 437 U.S. at 590, 198 USPQ at 197.

In contrast, the additional elements in _Diamond v. Diehr_ as a whole provided eligibility and did not merely recite calculating a cure time using the Arrhenius equation "in a rubber molding process". Instead, the claim in _Diehr_ recited specific limitations such as monitoring the elapsed time since the mold was closed, constantly measuring the temperature in the mold cavity, repetitively calculating a cure time by inputting the measured temperature into the Arrhenius equation, and opening the press automatically when the calculated cure time and the elapsed time are equivalent. 450 U.S. at 179, 209 USPQ at 5, n. 5. These specific limitations act in concert to transform raw, uncured rubber into cured molded rubber. 450 U.S. at 177-78, 209 USPQ at 4.

A more recent example of a limitation that does no more than generally link a judicial exception to a particular technological environment is _Affinity Labs of Texas v. DirecTV, LLC,_ 838 F.3d 1253, 120 USPQ2d 1201 (Fed. Cir. 2016). In _Affinity Labs,_ the claim recited a broadcast system in which a cellular telephone located outside the range of a regional broadcaster (1) requests and receives network-based content from the broadcaster via a streaming signal, (2) is configured to wirelessly download an application for performing those functions, and (3) contains a display that allows the user to select particular content. 838 F.3d at 1255-56, 120 USPQ2d at 1202. The court identified the claimed concept of providing out-of-region access to regional broadcast content as an abstract idea, and noted that the additional elements limited the wireless delivery of regional broadcast content to cellular telephones (as opposed to any and all electronic devices such as televisions, cable boxes, computers, or the like). 838 F.3d at 1258-59, 120 USPQ2d at 1204. Although the additional elements did limit the use of the abstract idea, the court explained that this type of limitation merely confines the use of the abstract idea to a particular technological environment (cellular telephones) and thus fails to add an inventive concept to the claims. 838 F.3d at 1259, 120 USPQ2d at 1204.

Examples of limitations that the courts have described as merely indicating a field of use or technological environment in which to apply a judicial exception include:

- i. A step of administering a drug providing 6-thioguanine to patients with an immune-mediated gastrointestinal disorder, because limiting drug administration to this patient population did no more than simply refer to the relevant pre-existing audience of doctors who used thiopurine drugs to treat patients suffering from autoimmune disorders, _Mayo Collaborative Servs. v. Prometheus Labs. Inc.,_ 566 U.S. 66, 78, 101 USPQ2d 1961, 1968 (2012);
- ii. Identifying the participants in a process for hedging risk as commodity providers and commodity consumers, because limiting the use of the process to these participants did no more than describe how the abstract idea of hedging risk could be used in the commodities and energy markets, _Bilski,_ 561 U.S. at 595, 95 USPQ2d at 1010;
- iii. Limiting the use of the formula C = 2 (pi) r to determining the circumference of a wheel as opposed to other circular objects, because this limitation represents a mere token acquiescence to limiting the reach of the claim, _Flook,_ 437 U.S. at 595, 198 USPQ at 199;
- iv. Specifying that the abstract idea of monitoring audit log data relates to transactions or activities that are executed in a computer environment, because this requirement merely limits the claims to the computer field, _i.e.,_ to execution on a generic computer, _FairWarning v. Iatric Sys.,_ 839 F.3d 1089, 1094-95, 120 USPQ2d 1293, 1295 (Fed. Cir. 2016);
- v. Language specifying that the process steps of virus screening were used within a telephone network or the Internet, because limiting the use of the process to these technological environments did not provide meaningful limits on the claim, _Intellectual Ventures I v. Symantec Corp.,_ 838 F.3d 1307, 1319-20, 120 USPQ2d 1353, 1361 (2016);
- vi. Limiting the abstract idea of collecting information, analyzing it, and displaying certain results of the collection and analysis to data related to the electric power grid, because limiting application of the abstract idea to power-grid monitoring is simply an attempt to limit the use of the abstract idea to a particular technological environment, _Electric Power Group, LLC v. Alstom S.A.,_ 830 F.3d 1350, 1354, 119 USPQ2d 1739, 1742 (Fed. Cir. 2016);
- vii. Language informing doctors to apply a law of nature (linkage disequilibrium) for purposes of detecting a genetic polymorphism, because this language merely informs the relevant audience that the law of nature can be used in this manner, _Genetic Techs. Ltd. v. Merial LLC,_ 818 F.3d 1369, 1379, 118 USPQ2d 1541, 1549 (Fed. Cir. 2016);
- viii. Language specifying that the abstract idea of budgeting was to be implemented using a "communication medium" that broadly included the Internet and telephone networks, because this limitation merely limited the use of the exception to a particular technological environment, _Intellectual Ventures I v. Capital One Bank,_ 792 F.3d 1363, 1367, 115 USPQ2d 1636, 1640 (Fed. Cir. 2015);
- ix. Specifying that the abstract idea of using advertising as currency is used on the Internet, because this narrowing limitation is merely an attempt to limit the use of the abstract idea to a particular technological environment, _Ultramercial, Inc. v. Hulu, LLC,_ 772 F.3d 709, 716, 112 USPQ2d 1750, 1755 (Fed. Cir. 2014); and
- x. Requiring that the abstract idea of creating a contractual relationship that guarantees performance of a transaction (a) be performed using a computer that receives and sends information over a network, or (b) be limited to guaranteeing online transactions, because these limitations simply attempted to limit the use of the abstract idea to computer environments, _buySAFE Inc. v. Google, Inc.,_ 765 F.3d 1350, 1354, 112 USPQ2d 1093, 1095-96 (Fed. Cir. 2014).

Examiners should be aware that the courts often use the terms "technological environment" and "field of use" interchangeably, and thus for purposes of the eligibility analysis examiners should consider these terms interchangeable. Examiners should also keep in mind that this consideration overlaps with other considerations, particularly insignificant extra-solution activity (see **[MPEP § 2106.05(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13df8_3d4.html)**). For instance, a data gathering step that is limited to a particular data source (such as the Internet) or a particular type of data (such as power grid data or XML tags) could be considered to be both insignificant extra-solution activity and a field of use limitation. See, _e.g., Ultramercial,_ 772 F.3d at 716, 112 USPQ2d at 1755 (limiting use of abstract idea to the Internet); _Electric Power,_ 830 F.3d at 1354, 119 USPQ2d at 1742 (limiting application of abstract idea to power grid data); _Intellectual Ventures I LLC v. Erie Indem. Co.,_ 850 F.3d 1315, 1328-29, 121 USPQ2d 1928, 1939 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (limiting use of abstract idea to use with XML tags). Thus, examiners should carefully consider each claim on its own merits, as well as evaluate all other relevant considerations, before making a determination on this consideration.

For claim limitations that generally link the use of the judicial exception to a particular technological environment or field of use, examiners should explain in an eligibility rejection why they do not meaningfully limit the claim. For example, an examiner could explain that employing generic computer functions to execute an abstract idea, even when limiting the use of the idea to one particular environment, does not add significantly more, similar to how limiting the abstract idea in _Flook_ to petrochemical and oil-refining industries was insufficient. For more information on formulating a subject matter eligibility rejection, see **[MPEP § 2106.07(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_14011_176.html)**.

# 2106.06    Streamlined Analysis [R-10.2019]

For purposes of efficiency in examination, examiners may use a streamlined eligibility analysis (Pathway A) when the eligibility of the claim is self-evident, _e.g.,_ because the claim clearly improves a technology or computer functionality. However, if there is doubt as to whether the applicant is effectively seeking coverage for a judicial exception itself, the full eligibility analysis (the _Alice/Mayo_ test described in **[MPEP § 2106](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e197244.html)**, subsection III) should be conducted to determine whether the claim integrates the judicial exception into a practical application or recites significantly more than the judicial exception.

The results of the streamlined analysis will always be the same as the full analysis, thus the streamlined analysis is not a means of avoiding a finding of ineligibility that would occur if a claim were to undergo the full eligibility analysis. Similarly, a claim that qualifies as eligible after Step 2A (Pathway B) or Step 2B (Pathway C) of the full analysis would also be eligible if the streamlined analysis (Pathway A) were applied to that claim. It may not be apparent that an examiner employed the streamlined analysis because the result is a conclusion that the claim is eligible, and there will be no rejection of the claim on eligibility grounds. In practice, the record may reflect the conclusion of eligibility simply by the absence of an eligibility rejection or may include clarifying remarks, when appropriate.

In the context of the flowchart in **[MPEP § 2106](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e197244.html)**, subsection III, if, when viewed as a whole, the eligibility of the claim is self-evident (e.g., because the claim clearly improves a technology or computer functionality), the claim is eligible at Pathway A, thereby concluding the eligibility analysis.

# 2106.06(a)    Eligibility is Self Evident [R-08.2017]

A streamlined eligibility analysis can be used for a claim that may or may not recite a judicial exception but, when viewed as a whole, clearly does not seek to tie up any judicial exception such that others cannot practice it. Such claims do not need to proceed through the full analysis herein as their eligibility will be self-evident. On the other hand, a claim that does not qualify as eligible after Step 2B of the full analysis would not be suitable for the streamlined analysis, because the claim lacks self‐evident eligibility.

For instance, a claim directed to a complex manufactured industrial product or process that recites meaningful limitations along with a judicial exception may sufficiently limit its practical application so that a full eligibility analysis is not needed. As an example, a robotic arm assembly having a control system that operates using certain mathematical relationships is clearly not an attempt to tie up use of the mathematical relationships and would not require a full analysis to determine eligibility. Also, a claim that recites a nature-based product, but clearly does not attempt to tie up the nature-based product, does not require a markedly different characteristics analysis to identify a "product of nature" exception. As an example, a claim directed to an artificial hip prosthesis coated with a naturally occurring mineral is not an attempt to tie up the mineral. Similarly, claimed products that merely include ancillary nature-based components, such as a claim that is directed to a cellphone with an electrical contact made of gold or a plastic chair with wood trim, would not require analysis of the nature-based component to determine whether the claims are directed to a "product of nature" exception because such claims do not attempt to improperly tie up the nature-based product.

# 2106.06(b)    Clear Improvement to a Technology or to Computer Functionality [R-08.2017]

As explained by the Federal Circuit, some improvements to technology or to computer functionality are not abstract when appropriately claimed, and thus claims to such improvements do not always need to undergo the full eligibility analysis. _Enfish, LLC v. Microsoft Corp.,_ 822 F.3d 1327, 1335-36, 118 USPQ2d 1684, 1689 (Fed. Cir. 2016). **[MPEP § 2106.05(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13c69_10.html)** provides details regarding improvements to a technology or computer functionality.

For instance, claims directed to clear improvements to computer-related technology do not need the full eligibility analysis. _Enfish,_ 822 F.3d at 1339, 118 USPQ2d at 1691-92 (claims to a self-referential table for a computer database held eligible at step 1 of the _Alice/Mayo_ test as not directed to an abstract idea). Claims directed to improvements to other technologies or technological processes, beyond computer improvements, may also avoid the full eligibility analysis. _McRO, Inc. v. Bandai Namco Games Am. Inc.,_ 837 F.3d 1299, 1316, 120 USPQ2d 1091, 1103 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (claims to automatic lip synchronization and facial expression animation found eligible at Step 1 of the _Alice/Mayo_ test as directed to an improvement in computer-related technology). In these cases, when the claims were viewed as a whole, their eligibility was self-evident based on the clear improvement, so no further analysis was needed. Although the Federal Circuit held these claims eligible at Step 2A as not being directed to abstract ideas, it would be reasonable for an examiner to have found these claims eligible at Pathway A based on the clear improvement, or at Pathway B (Step 2A) as not being directed to an abstract idea.

If the claims are a "close call" such that it is unclear whether the claims improve technology or computer functionality, a full eligibility analysis should be performed to determine eligibility. See _BASCOM Global Internet v. AT&T Mobility LLC,_ 827 F.3d 1341, 1349, 119 USPQ2d 1236, 1241 (Fed Cir. 2016). Only when the claims clearly improve technology or computer functionality, or otherwise have self-evident eligibility, should the streamlined analysis be used. For example, because the claims in _BASCOM_ described the concept of filtering content, which is a method of organizing human behavior previously found to be abstract, the Federal Circuit considered them to present a "close call" in the first step of the _Alice/Mayo_ test (Step 2A), and thus proceeded to the second step of the _Alice/Mayo_ test (Step 2B) to determine their eligibility. _Id._ Although the Federal Circuit held these claims eligible at Step 2B (Pathway C) because they presented a "technology-based solution" of filtering content on the Internet that overcame the disadvantages of prior art filtering systems and that amounted to significantly more than the recited abstract idea, it also would be reasonable for an examiner to have found these claims eligible at Pathway A or B if the examiner had considered the technology-based solution to be an improvement to computer functionality.

# 2106.07    Formulating and Supporting Rejections For Lack Of Subject Matter Eligibility [R-10.2019]

Eligibility rejections must be based on failure to comply with the substantive law under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  as interpreted by judicial precedent. The substantive law on eligibility is discussed in **[MPEP §§ 2106.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_139b2_397.html)** through **[2106.06](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13e6a_88.html)**. Examination guidance, training, and explanatory examples discuss the substantive law and establish the policies and procedures to be followed by examiners in evaluating patent applications for compliance with the substantive law, but do not serve as a basis for a rejection. Accordingly, while it would be acceptable for applicants to cite training materials or examples in support of an argument for finding eligibility in an appropriate factual situation, applicants should not be required to model their claims or responses after the training materials or examples to attain eligibility.

When evaluating a claimed invention for compliance with the substantive law on eligibility, examiners should review the record as a whole (_e.g.,_ the specification, claims, the prosecution history, and any relevant case law precedent or prior art) before reaching a conclusion with regard to whether the claimed invention sets forth patent eligible subject matter. The evaluation of whether the claimed invention qualifies as patent-eligible subject matter should be made on a claim-by-claim basis, because claims do not automatically rise or fall with similar claims in an application. For example, even if an independent claim is determined to be ineligible, the dependent claims may be eligible because they add limitations that integrate the judicial exception into a practical application or amount to significantly more than the judicial exception recited in the independent claim. And conversely, even if an independent claim is determined to be eligible, a dependent claim may be ineligible because it adds a judicial exception without also adding limitations that integrate the judicial exception or provide significantly more. Thus, each claim in an application should be considered separately based on the particular elements recited therein.

If the evaluation of the claimed invention results in a conclusion that it is more likely than not that the claim as a whole does not satisfy both criteria for eligibility (Step 1: NO and/or Step 2B: NO), then examiners should formulate an appropriate rejection of that claim under Step 1 and/or Step 2B. The rejection should set forth a _prima facie_ case of ineligibility under the substantive law. The concept of the _prima facie_ case is a procedural tool of patent examination, which allocates the burdens going forward between the examiner and applicant. In particular, the initial burden is on the examiner to explain why a claim or claims are ineligible for patenting clearly and specifically, so that applicant has sufficient notice and is able to effectively respond.

When an examiner determines a claim does not fall within a statutory category (Step 1: NO), the rejection should provide an explanation of why the claim does not fall within one of the four statutory categories of invention. See **[MPEP § 2106.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_139b2_397.html)** for a discussion of Step 1 and the statutory categories of invention.

When an examiner determines that a claim is directed to a judicial exception (Step 2A: YES) and does not provide an inventive concept (Step 2B: NO), the rejection should provide an explanation for each part of the Step 2 analysis. For example, the rejection should identify the judicial exception by referring to what is recited (_i.e.,_ set forth or described) in the claim and explain why it is considered an exception, identify any additional elements (specifically point to claim features/limitations/steps) recited in the claim beyond the identified judicial exception, and explain the reason(s) that the additional elements taken individually, and also taken as a combination, 1) do not integrate the judicial exception into a practical application and 2) do not result in the claim as a whole amounting to significantly more than the judicial exception. See **[MPEP § 2106.04](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_139db_e0.html)** _et seq._ for a discussion of Step 2A and the judicial exceptions, **[MPEP § 2106.05](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13c11_1cb.html)** _et seq._ for a discussion of Step 2B and the search for an inventive concept, and **[MPEP § 2106.07(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_14011_176.html)** for more information on formulating an ineligibility rejection.

If the evaluation of the claimed invention results in a conclusion that it is more likely than not that the claimed invention falls within a statutory category (Step 1: YES) and is either not directed to a judicial exception (Step 2A: NO) or is directed to a judicial exception and amounts to significantly more than the judicial exception (Step 2B: YES), then the examiner should not reject the claim. When evaluating a response by applicant to a subject matter eligibility rejection, examiners must carefully consider all of applicant’s arguments and evidence presented to rebut the rejection. If applicant properly challenges the examiner’s findings, the rejection should be withdrawn or, if the examiner deems it appropriate to maintain the rejection, a rebuttal must be provided in the next Office action. This is discussed in greater detail in **[MPEP § 2106.07(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_14065_2a0.html)**.

# 2106.07(a)    Formulating a Rejection For Lack of Subject Matter Eligibility [R-07.2022]

After determining what has been invented and establishing the broadest reasonable interpretation of the claimed invention (see **[MPEP § 2111](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e200352.html)**), the eligibility of each claim should be evaluated as a whole using the analysis detailed in **[MPEP § 2106](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e197244.html)**. If it is determined that the claim does not recite eligible subject matter, a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  is appropriate. When making the rejection, the Office action must provide an explanation as to why each claim is unpatentable, which must be sufficiently clear and specific to provide applicant sufficient notice of the reasons for ineligibility and enable the applicant to effectively respond.

Subject matter eligibility rejections under Step 1 are discussed in **[MPEP § 2106.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_139b2_397.html)**.

A subject matter eligibility rejection under Step 2 should provide an explanation for each part of the Step 2 analysis:

- • For Step 2A Prong One, the rejection should identify the judicial exception by referring to **what is recited** (_i.e.,_ set forth or described) in the claim and **explain why** it is considered an exception. For example, if the claim is directed to an **abstract idea**, the rejection should identify the abstract idea as it is recited (_i.e.,_ set forth or described) in the claim and explain why it is an abstract idea. Similarly, if the claim is directed to a **law of nature** or a **natural phenomenon**, the rejection should identify the law of nature or natural phenomenon as it is recited (_i.e.,_ set forth or described) in the claim and explain using a reasoned rationale why it is considered a law of nature or natural phenomenon.
- • For Step 2A Prong Two, the rejection should identify any additional elements (specifically point to claim features/limitations/steps) recited in the claim beyond the identified judicial exception; and **evaluate** the integration of the judicial exception into a practical application **by explaining** that 1) there are no additional elements in the claim; or 2) the claim as a whole, looking at the additional elements individually and in combination, does not integrate the judicial exception into a practical application using the considerations set forth in **[MPEP §§ 2106.04(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d2e7df_235a2_338.html)**, **[2106.05(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13c69_10.html)**- **[(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13cfb_2e.html)** and **[(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13d61_1a8.html)**- **[(h)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13e1a_22c.html)**. Examiners should give weight to all of the claimed additional elements in Prong Two, even if those elements represent well-understood, routine, conventional activity.
- • For Step 2B, the rejection should **explain why** the additional elements, taken individually and in combination, do not result in the claim, as a whole, amounting to significantly more than the identified judicial exception. For instance, when the examiner has concluded that certain claim elements recite well understood, routine, conventional activities in the relevant field, the examiner must expressly support the rejection in writing with one of the four options specified in Subsection III.

Under the principles of compact prosecution, regardless of whether a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  is made based on lack of subject matter eligibility, a complete examination should be made for every claim under each of the other patentability requirements: **[35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//al_d1fbe1_234ed_52.html)**, **[103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//al_d1fbe1_19797_b0.html)**, **[112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824912.html)**, and **[101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  (utility, inventorship and double patenting) and non-statutory double patenting. Thus, examiners should state all non-cumulative reasons and bases for rejecting claims in the first Office action.

## I.    **WHEN MAKING A REJECTION, IDENTIFY AND EXPLAIN THE JUDICIAL EXCEPTION RECITED IN THE CLAIM (STEP 2A PRONG ONE)**

A subject matter eligibility rejection should point to the specific claim limitation(s) that recites (_i.e.,_ sets forth or describes) the judicial exception. The rejection must explain why those claim limitations set forth or describe a judicial exception (_e.g.,_ a law of nature). Where the claim describes, but does not expressly set forth, the judicial exception, the rejection must also explain what subject matter those limitations describe, and why the described subject matter is a judicial exception. See **[MPEP § 2106.04](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_139db_e0.html)** for more information about Step 2A of the eligibility analysis.

When the examiner has determined the claim recites an **abstract idea**, the rejection should identify the abstract idea as it is recited (_i.e.,_ set forth or described) in the claim, and explain why it falls within one of the groupings of abstract ideas (_i.e.,_ mathematical concepts, mental processes, or certain methods of organizing human activity) enumerated in **[MPEP § 2106.04(a)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13ae3_321.html)**. Alternatively, the examiner should provide justification for why a specific limitation(s) recited in the claim is being treated as an abstract idea if it does not fall within the groupings of abstract ideas in accordance with the "tentative abstract idea" procedure (see **[MPEP § 2106.04(a)(3)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d2ea80_199c8_1c1.html)**). While not required, this explanation or justification may include citing to an appropriate court decision that supports the identification of the subject matter recited in the claim language as an abstract idea within one of the groupings. Examiners should be familiar with any cited decision relied upon in making or maintaining a rejection to ensure that the rejection is reasonably tied to the facts of the case and to avoid relying upon language taken out of context. Examiners should not go beyond those concepts that are enumerated as abstract ideas in **[MPEP § 2106.04](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_139db_e0.html)**, unless they are identifying a tentative abstract idea in the claim, and should avoid relying upon or citing non-precedential decisions unless the facts of the application under examination uniquely match the facts at issue in the non-precedential decisions. Examiners are reminded that a chart of court decisions is available on the USPTO’s Internet website (**[www.uspto.gov/ PatentEligibility](http://www.uspto.gov/PatentEligibility)** ).

Sample explanation: The claim recites the step of comparing collected information to a predefined threshold, which is an act of evaluating information that can be practically performed in the human mind. Thus, this step is an abstract idea in the "mental process" grouping.

When the examiner has determined the claim recites a **law of nature** or a **natural phenomenon**, the rejection should identify the law of nature or natural phenomenon as it is recited (_i.e.,_ set forth or described) in the claim and explain using a reasoned rationale why it is considered a law of nature or natural phenomenon. See **[MPEP § 2106.04(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13b6b_4c.html)** for more information about laws of nature and natural phenomena.

Sample explanation: The claim recites the correlation of X, and X is a law of nature because it describes a consequence of natural processes in the human body, e.g., the naturally-occurring relationship between the presence of Y and the manifestation of Z.

Sample explanation: The claim recites X, which is a natural phenomenon because it occurs in nature and exists in principle apart from any human action.

When the examiner has determined the claim recites a **product of nature,** the rejection should identify the exception as it is recited (_i.e.,_ set forth or described) in the claim, and explain using a reasoned rationale why the product does not have markedly different characteristics from its naturally occurring counterpart in its natural state. See **[MPEP § 2106.04(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13b6b_4c.html)** for more information about products of nature, and **[MPEP § 2106.04(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13bc1_b1.html)** for more information about the markedly different characteristics analysis.

Sample explanation: The claim recites X, which as explained in the specification was isolated from naturally occurring Y. X is a nature-based product, so it is compared to its closest naturally occurring counterpart (X in its natural state) to determine if it has markedly different characteristics. Because there is no indication in the record that isolation of X has resulted in a marked difference in structure, function, or other properties as compared to its counterpart, X is a product of nature exception.

## II.    **WHEN MAKING A REJECTION, EXPLAIN WHY THE ADDITIONAL CLAIM ELEMENTS DO NOT RESULT IN THE CLAIM AS A WHOLE INTEGRATING THE JUDICIAL EXCEPTION INTO A PRACTICAL APPLICATION OR AMOUNTING TO SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN THE JUDICIAL EXCEPTION (STEP 2A PRONG TWO AND STEP 2B)**

After identifying the judicial exception in the rejection, identify any additional elements (features/limitations/steps) recited in the claim beyond the judicial exception and explain why they do not integrate the judicial exception into a practical application and do not add significantly more to the exception. The explanation should address the additional elements both individually and as a combination when determining whether the claim as whole recites eligible subject matter. It is important to remember that a new combination of steps in a process may be patent eligible even though all the steps of the combination were individually well known and in common use before the combination was made. _Diamond v. Diehr,_ 450 U.S. 175, 188, 209 USPQ 1, 9 (1981). Thus, it is particularly critical to address the combination of additional elements, because while individually-viewed elements may not appear to integrate an exception into a practical application or add significantly more, those additional elements when viewed in combination may amount to significantly more than the exception by meaningfully limiting the judicial exception. See **[MPEP § 2106.05](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13c11_1cb.html)** for more information about Step 2B of the eligibility analysis.

A rejection should be made only if it is readily apparent to an examiner relying on the examiner's expertise in the art in the Step 2A Prong Two inquiry and Step 2B inquiry that the additional elements do not integrate the exception into a practical application and do not amount to claiming significantly more than the recited judicial exception. When making a rejection, it is important for the examiner to explain the rationale underlying the conclusion so that applicant can effectively respond. On the other hand, when appropriate, the examiner should explain why the additional elements integrate an exception into a practical application or provide an inventive concept by adding a meaningful limitation to the claimed exception. See **[MPEP §§ 2106.04(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d2e7df_235a2_338.html)** and **[2106.05](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13c11_1cb.html)** for a listing of considerations that qualify, and to not qualify, as integrating an exception or providing significantly more than an exception, and **[MPEP § 2106.07(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_1407f_384.html)** for more information on clarifying the record when a claim is found eligible.

In the Step 2B inquiry, if the examiner has concluded that particular claim limitations are well understood, routine, conventional activities (or elements) to those in the relevant field, the rejection should support this conclusion in writing with a factual determination in accordance with Subsection III below. See **[MPEP § 2106.05(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13d41_124.html)** for more information about well understood, routine, conventional activities and elements, and Subsection III below for more information about how to support a conclusion that a claim limitation is well understood, routine, conventional activity.

For claim limitations that recite a generic computer component performing generic computer functions at a high level of generality, such as using the Internet to gather data, examiners can explain why these generic computing functions do not meaningfully limit the claim. Examiners should keep in mind that the courts have held computer-implemented processes to be significantly more than an abstract idea (and thus eligible), where generic computer components are able in combination to perform functions that are not merely generic. _DDR Holdings, LLC v. Hotels.com, LP,_ 773 F.3d 1245, 1258-59, 113 USPQ2d 1097, 1106-07 (Fed. Cir. 2014). See **[MPEP § 2106.05(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13da8_a5.html)** for more information about generic computing functions that the courts have found to be mere instructions to implement a judicial exception on a computer, and **[MPEP § 2106.05(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13d41_124.html)** for more information about well understood, routine, conventional activities and elements (a relevant consideration only in Step 2B).

For claim limitations that add insignificant extra-solution activity to the judicial exception (e.g., mere data gathering in conjunction with a law of nature or abstract idea), or that generally link the use of the judicial exception to a particular technological environment or field of use, examiners should explain why they do not meaningfully limit the claim. For example, adding a final step of storing data to a process that only recites computing the area of a two dimensional space (a mathematical relationship) does not add a meaningful limitation to the process of computing the area. As another example, employing well-known computer functions to execute an abstract idea, even when limiting the use of the idea to one particular environment, does not integrate the exception into a practical application or add significantly more, similar to how limiting the computer implemented abstract idea in Flook to petrochemical and oil-refining industries was insufficient. See _e.g., Parker v. Flook,_ 437 U.S. 584, 588-90, 198 USPQ 193, 197-98 (1978) (limiting use of mathematical formula to use in particular industries did not amount to an inventive concept). See **[MPEP § 2106.05(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13df8_3d4.html)** for more information about insignificant extra-solution activity, and **[MPEP § 2106.05(h)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13e1a_22c.html)** for more information about generally linking use of a judicial exception to a particular technological environment or field of use.

In the event a rejection is made, it is a best practice for the examiner to consult the specification to determine if there are elements that could be added to the claim to make it eligible. If so, the examiner should identify those elements in the Office action and suggest them as a way to overcome the rejection.

## III.    **EVIDENTIARY REQUIREMENTS IN MAKING A § 101 REJECTION**

The courts consider the determination of whether a claim is eligible (which involves identifying whether an exception such as an abstract idea is being claimed) to be a question of law. _Rapid Litig. Mgmt. v. CellzDirect,_ 827 F.3d 1042, 1047, 119 USPQ2d 1370, 1372 (Fed. Cir. 2016); _OIP Techs. v. Amazon.com,_ 788 F.3d 1359, 1362, 115 USPQ2d 1090, 1092 (Fed. Cir. 2015); _DDR Holdings v. Hotels.com,_ 773 F.3d 1245, 1255, 113 USPQ2d 1097, 1104 (Fed. Cir. 2014); _In re Roslin Institute (Edinburgh),_ 750 F.3d 1333, 1335, 110 USPQ2d 1668, 1670 (Fed. Cir. 2014); _In re Bilski,_ 545 F.3d 943, 951, 88 USPQ2d 1385, 1388 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (_en banc_), aff’d by _Bilski v. Kappos,_ 561 U.S. 593, 95 USPQ2d 1001 (2010). Thus, the court does not require "evidence" that a claimed concept is a judicial exception, and generally decides the legal conclusion of eligibility without resolving any factual issues. _FairWarning IP, LLC v. Iatric Sys.,_ 839 F.3d 1089, 1097, 120 USPQ2d 1293, 1298 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (citing _Genetic Techs. Ltd. v. Merial LLC,_ 818 F.3d 1369, 1373, 118 USPQ2d 1541, 1544 (Fed. Cir. 2016)); _OIP Techs.,_ 788 F.3d at 1362, 115 USPQ2d at 1092; _Content Extraction & Transmission LLC v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.,_ 776 F.3d 1343, 1349, 113 USPQ2d 1354, 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2014). In some cases, however, the courts have characterized the issue of whether additional elements are well-understood, routine, conventional activity as an underlying factual issue upon which the legal conclusion of eligibility may be based. See, _e.g., Interval Licensing LLC v. AOL, Inc.,_ 896 F.3d. 1335, 1342, 127 USPQ2d 1553, 1557 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (patent eligibility is a question of law that may contain underlying issues of fact), _Berkheimer v. HP, Inc.,_ 881 F.3d 1360, 1368, 125 USPQ2d 1649, 1654 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (issue of whether additional elements are well-understood, routine, conventional activity is factual).

When performing the analysis at Step 2A Prong One, it is sufficient for the examiner to provide a reasoned rationale that identifies the judicial exception recited in the claim and explains why it is considered a judicial exception (e.g., that the claim limitation(s) falls within one of the abstract idea groupings). Therefore, there is no requirement for the examiner to rely on evidence, such as publications or an affidavit or declaration under **[37 CFR 1.104(d)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e322124.html##d0e322249)**, to find that a claim recites a judicial exception. _Cf. Affinity Labs of Tex., LLC v. Amazon.com Inc.,_ 838 F.3d 1266, 1271-72, 120 USPQ2d 1210, 1214-15 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (affirming district court decision that identified an abstract idea in the claims without relying on evidence); _OIP Techs., Inc. v. Amazon.com, Inc.,_ 788 F.3d 1359, 1362-64, 115 USPQ2d 1090, 1092-94 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (same); _Content Extraction & Transmission LLC v. Wells Fargo Bank,_ N.A., 776 F.3d 1343, 1347, 113 USPQ2d 1354, 1357-58 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (same).

At Step 2A Prong Two or Step 2B, there is no requirement for evidence to support a finding that the exception is not integrated into a practical application or that the additional elements do not amount to significantly more than the exception unless the examiner asserts that additional limitations are well-understood, routine, conventional activities in Step 2B.

Examiners should not assert that an additional element (or combination of elements) is well-understood, routine, or conventional unless the examiner finds, and expressly supports the rejection in writing with one or more of the following:

- (A) A citation to an express statement in the specification or to a statement made by an applicant during prosecution that demonstrates the well-understood, routine, conventional nature of the additional element(s). A specification demonstrates the well-understood, routine, conventional nature of additional elements when it describes the additional elements as well-understood or routine or conventional (or an equivalent term), as a commercially available product, or in a manner that indicates that the additional elements are sufficiently well-known that the specification does not need to describe the particulars of such additional elements to satisfy **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**. A finding that an element is well-understood, routine, or conventional cannot be based only on the fact that the specification is silent with respect to describing such element.
- (B) A citation to one or more of the court decisions discussed in **[MPEP § 2106.05(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13d41_124.html)**, subsection II, as noting the well-understood, routine, conventional nature of the additional element(s). Examiners should be careful to ensure the claim limitations before the examiner are the same as those found to be well-understood, routine, conventional by the courts. The additional elements under examination should be recited in the same manner, meaning they should be recited at the same high level of generality as in those court decisions. It is not enough that the additional elements are similar to the elements at issue in those cases. In addition, the court decisions discussed in **[MPEP § 2106.05(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13d41_124.html)**, subsection II, are not meant to imply that all computer functions are well-understood, routine, conventional functions, or that a claim reciting a generic computer component performing a generic computer function is necessarily ineligible. Examiners should keep in mind that the courts have held computer-implemented processes to be significantly more than an abstract idea (and thus eligible), where generic computer components are able in combination to perform functions that are not merely generic. _DDR Holdings, LLC v. Hotels.com, LP,_ 773 F.3d 1245, 1258-59, 113 USPQ2d 1097, 1106-07 (Fed. Cir. 2014). See **[MPEP § 2106.05(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13da8_a5.html)** for more information about generic computing functions that the courts have found to be mere instructions to implement a judicial exception on a computer.
- (C) A citation to a publication that demonstrates the well-understood, routine, conventional nature of the additional element(s). An appropriate publication could include a book, manual, review article, or other source that describes the state of the art and discusses what is well-known and in common use in the relevant industry. It does not include all items that might otherwise qualify as a "printed publication" as used in **[35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//al_d1fbe1_234ed_52.html)**. Whether something is disclosed in a document that is considered a "printed publication" under **[35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//al_d1fbe1_234ed_52.html)**  is a distinct inquiry from whether something is well-known, routine, conventional activity. A document may be a printed publication but still fail to establish that something it describes is well-understood, routine, conventional activity. See _Exergen Corp. v. Kaz USA,_ 725 Fed. App’x. 959, 966 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (the single copy of a thesis, written in German and located in a German university library, considered to be a "printed publication" in _In re Hall,_ 781 F.2d 897, 228 USPQ 453 (Fed. Cir. 1986) "would not suffice to establish that something is 'well-understood, routine, and conventional activity previously engaged in by scientists who work in the field'"). The nature of the publication and the description of the additional elements in the publication would need to demonstrate that the additional elements are widely prevalent or in common use in the relevant field, comparable to the types of activity or elements that are so well-known that they do not need to be described in detail in a patent application to satisfy **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**. For example, while U.S. patents and published applications are publications, merely finding the additional element in a single patent or published application would not be sufficient to demonstrate that the additional element is well-understood, routine, conventional, unless the patent or published application demonstrates that the additional element is widely prevalent or in common use in the relevant field.
- (D) A statement that the examiner is taking official notice of the well-understood, routine, conventional nature of the additional element(s). This option should be used only when examiners are certain, based upon their personal knowledge, that the additional element(s) represents well-understood, routine, conventional activity engaged in by those in the relevant art, in that the additional elements are widely prevalent or in common use in the relevant field, comparable to the types of activity or elements that are so well-known that they do not need to be described in detail in a patent application to satisfy **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**. For example, the examiner could take official notice that a generic computer component performing generic computer functions at a high level of generality, such as using the Internet to gather data, is well-understood, routine, conventional. Procedures for taking official notice and addressing an applicant’s challenge to official notice are discussed in **[MPEP § 2144.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e210752.html)**.

As a reminder, it is not necessary to identify a single category into which a claim falls, so long as it is clear that the claim falls into at least one category. See **[MPEP § 2106.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_139b2_397.html)**.

# ¶ 7.05.01    Rejection, 35 U.S.C. 101, Nonstatutory (Not One of the Four Statutory Categories)

the claimed invention is directed to nonstatutory subject matter. The claim(s) does/do not fall within at least one of the four categories of patent eligible subject matter because **[1]**

### Examiner Note:

1. This form paragraph should be preceded by form paragraph **[7.05](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//fp7.05.html)**.

2. In bracket 1, explain why the claimed invention is not patent eligible subject matter by identifying what the claim(s) is/are directed to and explain why it does not fall within at least one of the four categories of patent eligible subject matter recited in **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  (process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter), e.g., the claim(s) is/are directed to a signal _per se,_ mere information in the form of data, a contract between two parties, or a human being. Note, it is not necessary for a claim to fall into only a single category, so long as it is clear that it falls into at least one category (see **[MPEP § 2106.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e197244.html)**).

3. For a claim that is directed to a judicial exception and is nonstatutory, use form paragraph **[7.05.016](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//fp7.05.016.html)**.

# ¶ 7.05.016    Rejection, 35 U.S.C. 101, Nonstatutory (Directed to a Judicial Exception without an Inventive Concept/Significantly More)

the claimed invention is directed to **[1]** without significantly more. The claim(s) recite(s) **[2]**. This judicial exception is not integrated into a practical application because **[3]**. The claim(s) does/do not include additional elements that are sufficient to amount to significantly more than the judicial exception because **[4]**.

### Examiner Note:

1. This form paragraph should be preceded by form paragraph **[7.05](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//fp7.05.html)**. For claims that recite a tentative abstract idea (i.e., a limitation identified as an abstract idea even though it does not fall within the groupings of abstract ideas discussed in **[MPEP § 2106.04(a)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13ae3_321.html)**), this form paragraph should be accompanied by form paragraph **[7.05.017](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//fp7.05.017.html)**.

2. This form paragraph is for use with all product (machine, manufacture, and composition of matter) and process claims, and for all claims directed to a law of nature, natural phenomenon (including a product of nature), or abstract idea.

3. In bracket 1, identify whether the claim(s) are directed to a law of nature, a natural phenomenon (including a product of nature), or an abstract idea.

4. In bracket 2, identify the exception by referring to how it is recited in the claim and explain why it is considered an exception (e.g., for an abstract idea, identify the abstract idea grouping in **[MPEP § 2106.04(a)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13ae3_321.html)** into which the recited exception falls). For example, "the Arrhenius equation, which is a law of nature and a mathematical concept which describes the relationship between temperature and reaction rate" or "the series of steps instructing how to hedge risk, which is a fundamental economic practice and thus grouped as a certain method of organizing human interactions." For a product of nature exception, refer to how it is recited in the claim and explain why its characteristics are not markedly different from the product’s naturally occurring counterpart in its natural state. For example, "the naturally occurring DNA segment, which is not markedly different from its naturally occurring counterpart because it conveys the same genetic information." Provide additional explanation regarding the exception and how it has been identified when appropriate.

5. In bracket 3, explain why the combination of additional elements fails to integrate the judicial exception into a practical application. For example, if the claim is directed to an abstract idea with additional generic computer elements, explain that the generically recited computer elements do not add a meaningful limitation to the abstract idea because they amount to simply implementing the abstract idea on a computer; or, if the claim is directed to a method of using a naturally occurring correlation, explain that data gathering steps required to use the correlation do not add a meaningful limitation to the method as they are insignificant extra-solution activity. Similarly, if the claim recites a "naturally occurring DNA segment" with an additional element of a test tube, explain that merely placing the product of nature into a generic container such as a test tube does not add a meaningful limitation as it is merely a nominal or token extra-solution component of the claim, and is nothing more than an attempt to generally link the product of nature to a particular technological environment.

6. In bracket 4, identify the additional elements and explain why, when considered separately and in combination, they do not add significantly more (also known as an "inventive concept") to the exception. For example, if the additional limitations only store and retrieve information in memory, explain that these are well-understood, routine, conventional computer functions as recognized by the court decisions listed in **[MPEP § 2106.05(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13d41_124.html)**.

# ¶ 7.05.017    Rejection, 35 U.S.C. 101, TC Director Approval for "Tentative Abstract Idea"

The identified claim limitation(s) that recite(s) an abstract idea do/does not fall within the groupings of abstract ideas discussed in **[MPEP § 2106.04(a)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13ae3_321.html)**, i.e., mathematical concepts, mental processes, or certain methods of organizing human activity. Nonetheless, the claim limitation(s) is/are being treated as reciting an abstract idea because **[1]**.

This rejection has been approved by the Technology Center Director signing below.

### Examiner Note:

1. This form paragraph should be preceded by form paragraph **[7.05.016](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//fp7.05.016.html)**.

2. Approval from the TC Director is required to treat a tentative abstract idea (i.e., a claim limitation(s) that does not fall within the groupings of abstract ideas discussed in **[MPEP § 2106.04(a)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13ae3_321.html)**) as an abstract idea. This form paragraph should be used to demonstrate that this approval has been obtained.

3. In bracket 1, provide the justification for why the claim limitation(s) is/are being treated as an abstract idea. For example, provide an explanation of why the claim limitation is among the "basic tools of scientific and technological work."

4. In bracket 2, insert the TC Director's signature. Approval of the TC Director is required to treat a claim limitation that does not fall within the groupings of abstract ideas discussed in **[MPEP § 2106.04(a)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13ae3_321.html)** as reciting an abstract idea. See **[MPEP § 2106.04(a)(3)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d2ea80_199c8_1c1.html)**.

# 2106.07(b)    Evaluating Applicant’s Response [R-10.2019]

After examiners identify and explain in the record the reasons why a claim is directed to an abstract idea, natural phenomenon, or law of nature without significantly more, then the burden shifts to the applicant to either amend the claim or make a showing of why the claim is eligible for patent protection.

In response to a rejection based on failure to claim patent-eligible subject matter, applicant may: (i) amend the claim, e.g., to add additional elements or modify existing elements so that the claim as a whole amounts to significantly more than the judicial exception, (or integrates the judicial exception into a practical application), (ii) present persuasive arguments based on a good faith belief as to why the rejection is in error and/or (iii) submit evidence traversing a subject matter eligibility rejection according to the procedures set forth in **[MPEP § 716.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e92469.html)** and **[37 CFR 1.132](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e323552.html)**. When evaluating a response, examiners must carefully consider all of applicant's arguments and evidence rebutting the subject matter eligibility rejection. If applicant has amended the claim, examiners should determine the amended claim’s broadest reasonable interpretation and again perform the subject matter eligibility analysis.

If applicant's claim amendment(s), evidence, and/or argument(s) persuasively establish that the claim is not directed to a judicial exception or is directed to significantly more than a judicial exception, the rejection should be withdrawn. Applicant may argue that a claim is eligible because the claim as a whole integrates the judicial exception into a practical application or amounts to significantly more than the judicial exception when the additional elements are considered both individually and in combination. When an additional element is considered individually by the examiner, the additional element may be enough to integrate the judicial exception into a practical application or to qualify as "significantly more" if it meaningfully limits the judicial exception, _e.g.,_ it improves another technology or technical field, improves the functioning of a computer itself.

In addition, even if an element does not integrate a judicial exception into a practical application or amount to significantly more on its own (_e.g.,_ because it is merely a generic computer component performing generic computer functions), it can still integrate or amount to significantly more when considered in combination with the other elements of the claim. For example, generic computer components that individually perform merely generic computer functions (_e.g.,_ a CPU that performs mathematical calculations or a clock that produces time data) in some instances are able in combination to perform functions that are not generic computer functions and therefore integrate or amount to significantly more than an abstract idea (and are thus eligible).

If applicant properly challenges the examiner's findings but the examiner deems it appropriate to maintain the rejection, a rebuttal must be provided in the next Office action. Several examples of appropriate examiner responses are provided below.

- (1) If applicant challenges the identification of a tentative abstract idea that was based on a court case and the challenge is not persuasive, an appropriate response would be an explanation as to why the abstract idea identified in the claim is similar to the concept in the cited case.
- (2) If applicant responds to an examiner's assertion that something is well-known, routine, conventional activity with a specific argument or evidence that the additional elements in a claim are not well-understood, routine, conventional activities previously engaged in by those in the relevant art, the examiner should reevaluate whether the additional elements are in actuality well-known, routine, conventional activities to those who work in the relevant field. It is especially necessary for the examiner to fully reevaluate their position when such additional elements are not discussed in the specification as being known generic functions/components/activities or are not treated by the courts as well-understood, routine, conventional activities. If the rejection is to be maintained, the examiner should consider whether evidence should be provided to further support the rejection and clarify the record for appeal. See **[MPEP § 2106.05(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_13d41_124.html)** for examples of elements that the courts have found to be well understood, routine and conventional activity. If the examiner has taken official notice per item (D) of subsection III above that an element(s) is well-understood, routine, conventional activity, and the applicant challenges the examiner's position, specifically stating that such element(s) is not well-understood, routine, conventional activity, the examiner must then provide one of the items discussed in paragraphs (A) through (C) of subsection III above, or an affidavit or declaration under **[37 CFR 1.104(d)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e322124.html##d0e322249)**  setting forth specific factual statements and explanation to support the examiner’s position. See also **[MPEP § 2106.07(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d29a1b_14065_2a0.html)**, item (2).
- (3) If applicant amends a claim to add a generic computer or generic computer components and asserts that the claim is integrated into a practical application or recites significantly more because the generic computer is 'specially programmed' (as in _Alappat_, now considered superseded) or is a 'particular machine' (as in _Bilski_), the examiner should look at whether the added elements integrate the judicial exception into a practical application or provide significantly more than the judicial exception. Merely adding a generic computer, generic computer components, or a programmed computer to perform generic computer functions does not automatically overcome an eligibility rejection. _Alice Corp. Pty. Ltd. v. CLS Bank Int'l,_ 573 U.S. 208, 224, 110 USPQ2d 1976, 1984 (2014). See also _OIP Techs. v. Amazon.com,_ 788 F.3d 1359, 1364, 115 USPQ2d 1090, 1093-94 (Fed. Cir. 2015) ("Just as _Diehr_ could not save the claims in _Alice_, which were directed to ‘implement[ing] the abstract idea of intermediated settlement on a generic computer’, it cannot save _OIP_'s claims directed to implementing the abstract idea of price optimization on a generic computer.") (citations omitted).
- (4) If applicant argues that the claim is specific and does not preempt all applications of the exception, the examiner should reconsider Step 2A of the eligibility analysis, _e.g.,_ to determine whether the claim is directed to an improvement to the functioning of a computer or to any other technology or technical field. If an examiner still determines that the claim is directed to a judicial exception, the examiner should then reconsider in Step 2B whether the additional elements in combination (as well as individually) amount to an inventive concept, _e.g.,_ because they are more than the non-conventional and non-generic arrangement of known, conventional elements. Such reconsideration is appropriate because, although preemption is not a standalone test for eligibility, it remains the underlying concern that drives the two-part framework from _Alice Corp._ and _Mayo_ (Steps 2A and 2B). _Synopsys, Inc. v. Mentor Graphics Corp.,_ 839 F.3d 1138, 1150, 120 USPQ2d 1473, 1483 (Fed. Cir. 2016); _Rapid Litig. Mgmt. v. CellzDirect, Inc.,_ 827 F.3d 1042, 1052, 119 USPQ2d 1370, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2016); _Ariosa Diagnostics, Inc. v. Sequenom, Inc.,_ 788 F.3d 1371, 1379, 115 USPQ2d 1152, 1158 (Fed. Cir. 2015).

# 2106.07(c)    Clarifying the Record [R-08.2017]

When the claims are deemed patent eligible, the examiner may make clarifying remarks on the record. For example, if a claim is found eligible because it improves upon existing technology, the examiner could reference the portion of the specification that describes the claimed improvement and note the claim elements that produce that improvement. The clarifying remarks may be made at any point during prosecution as well as with a notice of allowance.

Clarifying remarks may be useful in explaining the rationale for a rejection as well. For instance, explaining the broadest reasonable interpretation (BRI) of a claim will assist applicant in understanding and responding to a rejection. As an example, a rejection for failure to recite patent eligible subject matter in a claim to a computer readable medium could include an explanation that the broadest reasonable interpretation of the claim covers a carrier wave, which does not fall within one of the four categories of invention, and a suggestion to overcome the rejection by submitting a narrowing amendment to cover the statutory embodiments.

# 2107    Guidelines for Examination of Applications for Compliance with the Utility Requirement [R-11.2013]

## I.    **INTRODUCTION**

The following Guidelines establish the policies and procedures to be followed by Office personnel in the evaluation of any patent application for compliance with the utility requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  and **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**, or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824.html)**, first paragraph. These Guidelines have been promulgated to assist Office personnel in their review of applications for compliance with the utility requirement. The Guidelines do not alter the substantive requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  and **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824.html)**, nor are they designed to obviate the examiner’s review of applications for compliance with all other statutory requirements for patentability. The Guidelines do not constitute substantive rulemaking and hence do not have the force and effect of law. Rejections will be based upon the substantive law, and it is these rejections which are appealable. Consequently, any perceived failure by Office personnel to follow these Guidelines is neither appealable nor petitionable.

## II.    **EXAMINATION GUIDELINES FOR THE UTILITY REQUIREMENT**

Office personnel are to adhere to the following procedures when reviewing patent applications for compliance with the "useful invention" ("utility") requirement of **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  and **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824.html)**, first paragraph.

- (A) Read the claims and the supporting written description.
    - (1) Determine what the applicant has claimed, noting any specific embodiments of the invention.
    - (2) Ensure that the claims define statutory subject matter (i.e., a process, machine, manufacture, composition of matter, or improvement thereof).
    - (3) If at any time during the examination, it becomes readily apparent that the claimed invention has a well-established utility, do not impose a rejection based on lack of utility. An invention has a well-established utility if (i) a person of ordinary skill in the art would immediately appreciate why the invention is useful based on the characteristics of the invention (e.g., properties or applications of a product or process), and (ii) the utility is specific, substantial, and credible.
- (B) Review the claims and the supporting written description to determine if the applicant has asserted for the claimed invention any specific and substantial utility that is credible:
    - (1) If the applicant has asserted that the claimed invention is useful for any particular practical purpose (i.e., it has a "specific and substantial utility") and the assertion would be considered credible by a person of ordinary skill in the art, do not impose a rejection based on lack of utility.
        - (i) A claimed invention must have a specific and substantial utility. This requirement excludes "throw-away," "insubstantial," or "nonspecific" utilities, such as the use of a complex invention as landfill, as a way of satisfying the utility requirement of **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**.
        - (ii) Credibility is assessed from the perspective of one of ordinary skill in the art in view of the disclosure and any other evidence of record (e.g., test data, affidavits or declarations from experts in the art, patents or printed publications) that is probative of the applicant’s assertions. An applicant need only provide one credible assertion of specific and substantial utility for each claimed invention to satisfy the utility requirement.
    - (2) If no assertion of specific and substantial utility for the claimed invention made by the applicant is credible, and the claimed invention does not have a readily apparent well-established utility, reject the claim(s) under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  on the grounds that the invention as claimed lacks utility. Also reject the claims under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824.html)**, first paragraph, on the basis that the disclosure fails to teach how to use the invention as claimed. The **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824912.html)**, first paragraph, rejection imposed in conjunction with a **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  rejection should incorporate by reference the grounds of the corresponding **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  rejection.
    - (3) If the applicant has not asserted any specific and substantial utility for the claimed invention and it does not have a readily apparent well-established utility, impose a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**, emphasizing that the applicant has not disclosed a specific and substantial utility for the invention. Also impose a separate rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824912.html)**, first paragraph, on the basis that the applicant has not disclosed how to use the invention due to the lack of a specific and substantial utility. The **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  and **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824.html)**  rejections shift the burden of coming forward with evidence to the applicant to:
        - (i) Explicitly identify a specific and substantial utility for the claimed invention; and
        - (ii) Provide evidence that one of ordinary skill in the art would have recognized that the identified specific and substantial utility was well-established at the time of filing. The examiner should review any subsequently submitted evidence of utility using the criteria outlined above. The examiner should also ensure that there is an adequate nexus between the evidence and the properties of the now claimed subject matter as disclosed in the application as filed. That is, the applicant has the burden to establish a probative relation between the submitted evidence and the originally disclosed properties of the claimed invention.
    - (C) Any rejection based on lack of utility should include a detailed explanation why the claimed invention has no specific and substantial credible utility. Whenever possible, the examiner should provide documentary evidence regardless of publication date (e.g., scientific or technical journals, excerpts from treatises or books, or U.S. or foreign patents) to support the factual basis for the _prima facie_ showing of no specific and substantial credible utility. If documentary evidence is not available, the examiner should specifically explain the scientific basis for his or her factual conclusions.
        - (1) Where the asserted utility is not specific or substantial, a _prima facie_ showing must establish that it is more likely than not that a person of ordinary skill in the art would not consider that any utility asserted by the applicant would be specific and substantial. The _prima facie_ showing must contain the following elements:
            - (i) An explanation that clearly sets forth the reasoning used in concluding that the asserted utility for the claimed invention is not both specific and substantial nor well-established;
            - (ii) Support for factual findings relied upon in reaching this conclusion; and
            - (iii) An evaluation of all relevant evidence of record, including utilities taught in the closest prior art.
        - (2) Where the asserted specific and substantial utility is not credible, a _prima facie_ showing of no specific and substantial credible utility must establish that it is more likely than not that a person skilled in the art would not consider credible any specific and substantial utility asserted by the applicant for the claimed invention. The _prima facie_ showing must contain the following elements:
            - (i) An explanation that clearly sets forth the reasoning used in concluding that the asserted specific and substantial utility is not credible;
            - (ii) Support for factual findings relied upon in reaching this conclusion; and
            - (iii) An evaluation of all relevant evidence of record, including utilities taught in the closest prior art.
        - (3) Where no specific and substantial utility is disclosed or is well-established, a _prima facie_ showing of no specific and substantial utility need only establish that applicant has not asserted a utility and that, on the record before the examiner, there is no known well-established utility.
    - (D) A rejection based on lack of utility should not be maintained if an asserted utility for the claimed invention would be considered specific, substantial, and credible by a person of ordinary skill in the art in view of all evidence of record.

Office personnel are reminded that they must treat as true a statement of fact made by an applicant in relation to an asserted utility, unless countervailing evidence can be provided that shows that one of ordinary skill in the art would have a legitimate basis to doubt the credibility of such a statement. Similarly, Office personnel must accept an opinion from a qualified expert that is based upon relevant facts whose accuracy is not being questioned; it is improper to disregard the opinion solely because of a disagreement over the significance or meaning of the facts offered.

Once a _prima facie_ showing of no specific and substantial credible utility has been properly established, the applicant bears the burden of rebutting it. The applicant can do this by amending the claims, by providing reasoning or arguments, or by providing evidence in the form of a declaration under **[37 CFR 1.132](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e323552.html)**  or a patent or a printed publication that rebuts the basis or logic of the _prima facie_ showing. If the applicant responds to the _prima facie_ rejection, the Office personnel should review the original disclosure, any evidence relied upon in establishing the _prima facie_ showing, any claim amendments, and any new reasoning or evidence provided by the applicant in support of an asserted specific and substantial credible utility. It is essential for Office personnel to recognize, fully consider and respond to each substantive element of any response to a rejection based on lack of utility. Only where the totality of the record continues to show that the asserted utility is not specific, substantial, and credible should a rejection based on lack of utility be maintained.

If the applicant satisfactorily rebuts a _prima facie_ rejection based on lack of utility under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**, withdraw the **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  rejection and the corresponding rejection imposed under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824912.html)**, first paragraph.

# 2107.01    General Principles Governing Utility Rejections [R-07.2022]

#### _35 U.S.C. 101   Inventions patentable._

Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions and requirements of this title.

See **[MPEP § 2107](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e198469.html)** for guidelines for the examination of applications for compliance with the utility requirement of **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**.

The Office must examine each application to ensure compliance with the "useful invention" or utility requirement of **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**. In discharging this obligation, however, Office personnel must keep in mind several general principles that control application of the utility requirement. **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  has been interpreted as imposing four purposes. First, **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  limits an inventor to ONE patent for a claimed invention. If more than one patent is sought, a patent applicant will receive a statutory double patenting rejection for claims included in more than one application that are directed to the same invention. See **[MPEP § 804](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e98894.html)**. Second, the inventor(s) must be the applicant in an application filed before September 16, 2012, (except as otherwise provided in **[pre-AIA 37 CFR 1.41(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e317666.html##d0e317757)** ) and the inventor or each joint inventor must be identified in an application filed on or after September 16, 2012. See **[MPEP § 2109](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d2c183_22374_28b.html)** for a detailed discussion of inventorship, **[MPEP § 602.01(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e4830ss602.html)** _et seq._ for details regarding correction of inventorship, **[MPEP § 2157](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d20034_1bb92_e7.html)** for rejections under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  and **[115](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302875912.html)**  for failure to set forth the correct inventorship, and **[MPEP § 2137](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e206570.html)** for rejections under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302383.html##d0e302420)**  (for applications subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302383.html)** ) for failure to set forth the correct inventorship. Third, **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  defines which categories of inventions are eligible for patent protection. An invention that is not a machine, an article of manufacture, a composition or a process cannot be patented. See _Diamond_ _v._ _Chakrabarty,_ 447 U.S. 303, 206 USPQ 193 (1980); _Diamond_ _v._ _Diehr,_ 450 U.S. 175, 209 USPQ 1 (1981); _In re Nuijten,_ 500 F.3d 1346, 1354, 84 USPQ2d 1495, 1500 (Fed. Cir. 2007). Fourth, **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  serves to ensure that patents are granted on only those inventions that are "useful." This second purpose has a Constitutional footing — Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution authorizes Congress to provide exclusive rights to inventors to promote the "useful arts." See _Carl Zeiss Stiftung_ _v._ _Renishaw PLC,_ 945 F.2d 1173, 20 USPQ2d 1094 (Fed. Cir. 1991). Thus, to satisfy the requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**, an applicant must claim an invention that is statutory subject matter and must show that the claimed invention is "useful" for some purpose either explicitly or implicitly. Application of this latter element of **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  is the focus of these guidelines.

Deficiencies under the "useful invention" requirement of **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  will arise in one of two forms. The first is where it is not apparent why the invention is "useful." This can occur when an applicant fails to identify any specific and substantial utility for the invention or fails to disclose enough information about the invention to make its usefulness immediately apparent to those familiar with the technological field of the invention. _Brenner_ _v._ _Manson,_ 383 U.S. 519, 148 USPQ 689 (1966); _In re Fisher,_ 421 F.3d 1365, 76 USPQ2d 1225 (Fed. Cir. 2005); _In re Ziegler,_ 992 F.2d 1197, 26 USPQ2d 1600 (Fed. Cir. 1993). The second type of deficiency arises in the rare instance where an assertion of specific and substantial utility for the invention made by an applicant is not credible.

## I.    **SPECIFIC AND SUBSTANTIAL REQUIREMENTS**

To satisfy **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**, an invention must be "useful." Courts have recognized that the term "useful" used with reference to the utility requirement can be a difficult term to define. _Brenner_ _v._ _Manson,_ 383 U.S. 519, 529, 148 USPQ 689, 693 (1966) (simple everyday word like "useful" can be "pregnant with ambiguity when applied to the facts of life."). Where an applicant has set forth a specific and substantial utility, courts have been reluctant to uphold a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  solely on the basis that the applicant’s opinion as to the nature of the specific and substantial utility was inaccurate. For example, in _Nelson_ _v._ _Bowler,_ 626 F.2d 853, 206 USPQ 881 (CCPA 1980), the court reversed a finding by the Office that the applicant had not set forth a "practical" utility under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**. In this case the applicant asserted that the composition was "useful" in a particular pharmaceutical application and provided evidence to support that assertion. Courts have used the labels "practical utility," "substantial utility," or "specific utility" to refer to this aspect of the "useful invention" requirement of **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**. The Court of Customs and Patent Appeals has stated:

> Practical utility is a shorthand way of attributing "real-world" value to claimed subject matter. In other words, one skilled in the art can use a claimed discovery in a manner which provides some immediate benefit to the public.

_Nelson v. Bowler,_ 626 F.2d 853, 856, 206 USPQ 881, 883 (CCPA 1980).

Practical considerations require the Office to rely on the inventor’s understanding of the invention in determining whether and in what regard an invention is believed to be "useful." Because of this, Office personnel should focus on and be receptive to assertions made by the applicant that an invention is "useful" for a particular reason.

## A.    **_Specific Utility_**

A "specific utility" is _specific_ to the subject matter claimed and can "provide a well-defined and particular benefit to the public." _In re Fisher,_ 421 F.3d 1365, 1371, 76 USPQ2d 1225, 1230 (Fed. Cir. 2005). This contrasts with a _general_ utility that would be applicable to the broad class of the invention. Office personnel should distinguish between situations where an applicant has disclosed a specific use for or application of the invention and situations where the applicant merely indicates that the invention may prove useful without identifying with specificity why it is considered useful. For example, indicating that a compound may be useful in treating unspecified disorders, or that the compound has "useful biological" properties, would not be sufficient to define a specific utility for the compound. See, e.g., _In re Kirk,_ 376 F.2d 936, 153 USPQ 48 (CCPA 1967); _In re Joly,_ 376 F.2d 906, 153 USPQ 45 (CCPA 1967). Similarly, a claim to a polynucleotide whose use is disclosed simply as a "gene probe" or "chromosome marker" would not be considered to be _specific_ in the absence of a disclosure of a specific DNA target. See _In re Fisher,_ 421 F.3d at 1374, 76 USPQ2d at 1232 ("Any EST [expressed sequence tag] transcribed from any gene in the maize genome has the potential to perform any one of the alleged uses…. Nothing about [applicant’s] seven alleged uses set the five claimed ESTs apart from the more than 32,000 ESTs disclosed in the [ ] application or indeed from any EST derived from any organism. Accordingly, we conclude that [applicant] has only disclosed general uses for its claimed ESTs, not specific ones that satisfy **[§ 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**."). A general statement of diagnostic utility, such as diagnosing an unspecified disease, would ordinarily be insufficient absent a disclosure of what condition can be diagnosed. Contrast the situation where an applicant discloses a specific biological activity and reasonably correlates that activity to a disease condition. Assertions falling within the latter category are sufficient to identify a specific utility for the invention. Assertions that fall in the former category are insufficient to define a specific utility for the invention, especially if the assertion takes the form of a general statement that makes it clear that a "useful" invention may arise from what has been disclosed by the applicant. _Knapp v._ _Anderson,_ 477 F.2d 588, 177 USPQ 688 (CCPA 1973).

## B.    **_Substantial Utility_**

"[A]n application must show that an invention is useful to the public as disclosed in its current form, not that it may prove useful at some future date after further research. Simply put, to satisfy the ‘substantial’ utility requirement, an asserted use must show that the claimed invention has a significant and presently available benefit to the public." _Fisher,_ 421 F.3d at 1371, 76 USPQ2d at 1230. The claims at issue in _Fisher_ were directed to expressed sequence tags (ESTs), which are short nucleotide sequences that can be used to discover what genes and downstream proteins are expressed in a cell. The court held that "the claimed ESTs can be used only to gain further information about the underlying genes and the proteins encoded for by those genes. The claimed ESTs themselves are not an end of [the inventor’s] research effort, but only tools to be used along the way in the search for a practical utility…. [Applicant] does not identify the function for the underlying protein-encoding genes. Absent such identification, we hold that the claimed ESTs have not been researched and understood to the point of providing an immediate, well-defined, real world benefit to the public meriting the grant of a patent." _Id._ at 1376, 76 USPQ2d at 1233-34). Thus a "substantial utility" defines a "real world" use. Utilities that require or constitute carrying out further research to identify or reasonably confirm a "real world" context of use are not substantial utilities. For example, both a therapeutic method of treating a known or newly discovered disease and an assay method for identifying compounds that themselves have a "substantial utility" define a "real world" context of use. An assay that measures the presence of a material which has a stated correlation to a predisposition to the onset of a particular disease condition would also define a "real world" context of use in identifying potential candidates for preventive measures or further monitoring. On the other hand, the following are examples of situations that require or constitute carrying out further research to identify or reasonably confirm a "real world" context of use and, therefore, do not define "substantial utilities":

- (A) Basic research such as studying the properties of the claimed product itself or the mechanisms in which the material is involved;
- (B) A method of treating an _unspecified_ disease or condition;
- (C) A method of assaying for or identifying a material that itself has no specific and/or substantial utility;
- (D) A method of making a material that itself has no specific, substantial, and credible utility; and
- (E) A claim to an intermediate product for use in making a final product that has no specific, substantial and credible utility.

Office personnel must be careful not to interpret the phrase "immediate benefit to the public" or similar formulations in other cases to mean that products or services based on the claimed invention must be "currently available" to the public in order to satisfy the utility requirement. See, e.g., _Brenner v. Manson,_ 383 U.S. 519, 534-35, 148 USPQ 689, 695 (1966). Rather, any reasonable use that an applicant has identified for the invention that can be viewed as providing a public benefit should be accepted as sufficient, at least with regard to defining a "substantial" utility.

## C.    **_Research Tools_**

Some confusion can result when one attempts to label certain types of inventions as not being capable of having a specific and substantial utility based on the setting in which the invention is to be used. One example is inventions to be used in a research or laboratory setting. Many research tools such as gas chromatographs, screening assays, and nucleotide sequencing techniques have a clear, specific and unquestionable utility (e.g., they are useful in analyzing compounds). An assessment that focuses on whether an invention is useful only in a research setting thus does not address whether the invention is in fact "useful" in a patent sense. Instead, Office personnel must distinguish between inventions that have a specifically identified substantial utility and inventions whose asserted utility requires further research to identify or reasonably confirm. Labels such as "research tool," "intermediate" or "for research purposes" are not helpful in determining if an applicant has identified a specific and substantial utility for the invention.

## II.    **WHOLLY INOPERATIVE INVENTIONS; "INCREDIBLE" UTILITY**

An invention that is "inoperative" (i.e., it does not operate to produce the results claimed by the patent applicant) is not a "useful" invention in the meaning of the patent law. See, e.g., _Newman_ _v._ _Quigg,_ 877 F.2d 1575, 1581, 11 USPQ2d 1340, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 1989); _In re Harwood,_ 390 F.2d 985, 989, 156 USPQ 673, 676 (CCPA 1968) ("An inoperative invention, of course, does not satisfy the requirement of **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  that an invention be useful."). However, as the Federal Circuit has stated, "[t]o violate **[[35 U.S.C.] 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  the claimed device must be totally incapable of achieving a useful result." _Brooktree Corp._ _v._ _Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.,_ 977 F.2d 1555, 1571, 24 USPQ2d 1401, 1412 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (emphasis added). See also _E.I. du Pont De Nemours and Co._ _v._ _Berkley and Co.,_ 620 F.2d 1247, 1260 n.17, 205 USPQ 1, 10 n.17 (8th Cir. 1980) ("A small degree of utility is sufficient . . . The claimed invention must only be capable of performing some beneficial function . . . An invention does not lack utility merely because the particular embodiment disclosed in the patent lacks perfection or performs crudely . . . A commercially successful product is not required . . . Nor is it essential that the invention accomplish all its intended functions . . . or operate under all conditions . . . partial success being sufficient to demonstrate patentable utility . . . In short, the defense of non-utility cannot be sustained without proof of total incapacity." If an invention is only partially successful in achieving a useful result, a rejection of the claimed invention as a whole based on a lack of utility is not appropriate. See _In re Brana,_ 51 F.3d 1560, 34 USPQ2d 1436 (Fed. Cir. 1995); _In re Gardner,_ 475 F.2d 1389, 177 USPQ 396 (CCPA), _reh’g denied,_ 480 F.2d 879 (CCPA 1973); _In re Marzocchi,_ 439 F.2d 220, 169 USPQ 367 (CCPA 1971).

Situations where an invention is found to be "inoperative" and therefore lacking in utility are rare, and rejections maintained solely on this ground by a federal court even rarer. In many of these cases, the utility asserted by the applicant was thought to be "incredible in the light of the knowledge of the art, or factually misleading" when initially considered by the Office. _In re Citron,_ 325 F.2d 248, 253, 139 USPQ 516, 520 (CCPA 1963). Other cases suggest that on initial evaluation, the Office considered the asserted utility to be inconsistent with known scientific principles or "speculative at best" as to whether attributes of the invention necessary to impart the asserted utility were actually present in the invention. _In re Sichert,_ 566 F.2d 1154, 196 USPQ 209 (CCPA 1977). However cast, the underlying finding by the court in these cases was that, based on the factual record of the case, it was clear that the invention could not and did not work as the inventor claimed it did. Indeed, the use of many labels to describe a single problem (e.g., a false assertion regarding utility) has led to some of the confusion that exists today with regard to a rejection based on the "utility" requirement. Examples of such cases include: an invention asserted to change the taste of food using a magnetic field _(Fregeau_ _v._ _Mossinghoff,_ 776 F.2d 1034, 227 USPQ 848 (Fed. Cir. 1985)), a perpetual motion machine _(Newman_ _v._ _Quigg,_ 877 F.2d 1575, 11 USPQ2d 1340 (Fed. Cir. 1989)), a flying machine operating on "flapping or flutter function" _(In re Houghton,_ 433 F.2d 820, 167 USPQ 687 (CCPA 1970)), a "cold fusion" process for producing energy _(In re Swartz,_ 232 F.3d 862, 56 USPQ2d 1703 (Fed. Cir. 2000)), a method for increasing the energy output of fossil fuels upon combustion through exposure to a magnetic field _(In re Ruskin,_ 354 F.2d 395, 148 USPQ 221 (CCPA 1966)), uncharacterized compositions for curing a wide array of cancers _(In re Citron,_ 325 F.2d 248, 139 USPQ 516 (CCPA 1963)), and a method of controlling the aging process _(In re Eltgroth,_ 419 F.2d 918, 164 USPQ 221 (CCPA 1970)). These examples are fact specific and should not be applied as a _per se_ rule. Thus, in view of the rare nature of such cases, Office personnel should not label an asserted utility "incredible," "speculative" or otherwise unless it is clear that a rejection based on "lack of utility" is proper.

## III.    **THERAPEUTIC OR PHARMACOLOGICAL UTILITY**

Inventions asserted to have utility in the treatment of human or animal disorders are subject to the same legal requirements for utility as inventions in any other field of technology. _In re Chilowsky,_ 229 F.2d 457, 461-2, 108 USPQ 321, 325 (CCPA 1956) ("There appears to be no basis in the statutes or decisions for requiring any more conclusive evidence of operativeness in one type of case than another. The character and amount of evidence needed may vary, depending on whether the alleged operation described in the application appears to accord with or to contravene established scientific principles or to depend upon principles alleged but not generally recognized, but the degree of certainty as to the ultimate fact of operativeness or inoperativeness should be the same in all cases"); _In re Gazave,_ 379 F.2d 973, 978, 154 USPQ 92, 96 (CCPA 1967) ("Thus, in the usual case where the mode of operation alleged can be readily understood and conforms to the known laws of physics and chemistry, operativeness is not questioned, and no further evidence is required."). As such, pharmacological or therapeutic inventions that provide any "immediate benefit to the public" satisfy **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**. The utility being asserted in _Nelson_ related to a compound with pharmacological utility. _Nelson_ _v._ _Bowler,_ 626 F.2d 853, 856, 206 USPQ 881, 883 (CCPA 1980). Office personnel should rely on _Nelson_ and other cases as providing general guidance when evaluating the utility of an invention that is based on any therapeutic, prophylactic, or pharmacological activities of that invention.

Courts have repeatedly found that the mere identification of a pharmacological activity of a compound that is relevant to an asserted pharmacological use provides an "immediate benefit to the public" and thus satisfies the utility requirement. As the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals held in _Nelson_ _v._ _Bowler_:

> Knowledge of the pharmacological activity of any compound is obviously beneficial to the public. It is inherently faster and easier to combat illnesses and alleviate symptoms when the medical profession is armed with an arsenal of chemicals having known pharmacological activities. Since it is crucial to provide researchers with an incentive to disclose pharmacological activities in as many compounds as possible, we conclude that adequate proof of any such activity constitutes a showing of practical utility.

_Nelson_ _v._ _Bowler,_ 626 F.2d 853, 856, 206 USPQ 881, 883 (CCPA 1980).

In _Nelson_ _v._ _Bowler,_ the court addressed the practical utility requirement in the context of an interference proceeding. Bowler challenged the patentability of the invention claimed by Nelson on the basis that Nelson had failed to sufficiently and persuasively disclose in his application a practical utility for the invention. Nelson had developed and claimed a class of synthetic prostaglandins modeled on naturally occurring prostaglandins. Naturally occurring prostaglandins are bioactive compounds that, at the time of Nelson’s application, had a recognized value in pharmacology (e.g., the stimulation of uterine smooth muscle which resulted in labor induction or abortion, the ability to raise or lower blood pressure, etc.). To support the utility he identified in his disclosure, Nelson included in his application the results of tests demonstrating the bioactivity of his new substituted prostaglandins relative to the bioactivity of naturally occurring prostaglandins. The court concluded that Nelson had satisfied the practical utility requirement in identifying the synthetic prostaglandins as pharmacologically active compounds. In reaching this conclusion, the court considered and rejected arguments advanced by Bowler that attacked the evidentiary basis for Nelson’s assertions that the compounds were pharmacologically active.

In _In re Jolles,_ 628 F.2d 1322, 206 USPQ 885 (CCPA 1980), an inventor claimed protection for pharmaceutical compositions for treating leukemia. The active ingredient in the compositions was a structural analog to a known anticancer agent. The applicant provided evidence showing that the claimed analogs had the same general pharmaceutical activity as the known anticancer agents. The court reversed the Board’s finding that the asserted pharmaceutical utility was "incredible," pointing to the evidence that showed the relevant pharmacological activity.

In _Cross_ _v._ _Iizuka,_ 753 F.2d 1040, 224 USPQ 739 (Fed. Cir. 1985), the Federal Circuit affirmed a finding by the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences that a pharmacological utility had been disclosed in the application of one party to an interference proceeding. The invention that was the subject of the interference count was a chemical compound used for treating blood disorders. Cross had challenged the evidence in Iizuka’s specification that supported the claimed utility. However, the Federal Circuit relied extensively on _Nelson_ _v._ _Bowler_ in finding that Iizuka’s application had sufficiently disclosed a pharmacological utility for the compounds. It distinguished the case from cases where only a generalized "nebulous" expression, such as "biological properties," had been disclosed in a specification. Such statements, the court held, "convey little explicit indication regarding the utility of a compound." _Cross,_ 753 F.2d at 1048, 224 USPQ at 745 (citing _In re Kirk,_ 376 F.2d 936, 941, 153 USPQ 48, 52 (CCPA 1967)).

Similarly, courts have found utility for therapeutic inventions despite the fact that an inventor is at a very early stage in the development of a pharmaceutical product or therapeutic regimen based on a claimed pharmacological or bioactive compound or composition. The Federal Circuit, in _Cross_ _v._ _Iizuka,_ 753 F.2d 1040, 1051, 224 USPQ 739, 747-48 (Fed. Cir. 1985), commented on the significance of data from _in vitro_ testing that showed pharmacological activity:

> We perceive no insurmountable difficulty, under appropriate circumstances, in finding that the first link in the screening chain, _in vitro_ testing, may establish a practical utility for the compound in question. Successful _in vitro_ testing will marshal resources and direct the expenditure of effort to further _in vivo_ testing of the most potent compounds, thereby providing an immediate benefit to the public, analogous to the benefit provided by the showing of an _in vivo_ utility.

The Federal Circuit has reiterated that therapeutic utility sufficient under the patent laws is not to be confused with the requirements of the FDA with regard to safety and efficacy of drugs to marketed in the United States.

> FDA approval, however, is not a prerequisite for finding a compound useful within the meaning of the patent laws. _Scott v._ _Finney,_ 34 F.3d 1058, 1063, 32 USPQ2d 1115, 1120 [(Fed.Cir. 1994)]. Usefulness in patent law, and in particular in the context of pharmaceutical inventions, necessarily includes the expectation of further research and development. The stage at which an invention in this field becomes useful is well before it is ready to be administered to humans. Were we to require Phase II testing in order to prove utility, the associated costs would prevent many companies from obtaining patent protection on promising new inventions, thereby eliminating an incentive to pursue, through research and development, potential cures in many crucial areas such as the treatment of cancer.

_In re Brana,_ 51 F.3d 1560, 34 USPQ2d 1436 (Fed. Cir. 1995). Accordingly, Office personnel should not construe **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**, under the logic of "practical" utility or otherwise, to require that an applicant demonstrate that a therapeutic agent based on a claimed invention is a safe or fully effective drug for humans. See, e.g., _In re Sichert,_ 566 F.2d 1154, 196 USPQ 209 (CCPA 1977); _In re Hartop,_ 311 F.2d 249, 135 USPQ 419 (CCPA 1962); _In re Anthony,_ 414 F.2d 1383, 162 USPQ 594 (CCPA 1969); _In re Watson,_ 517 F.2d 465, 186 USPQ 11 (CCPA 1975).

These general principles are equally applicable to situations where an applicant has claimed a process for treating a human or animal disorder. In such cases, the asserted utility is usually clear — the invention is asserted to be useful in treating the particular disorder. If the asserted utility is credible, there is no basis to challenge such a claim on the basis that it lacks utility under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**.

# 2107.02    Procedural Considerations Related to Rejections for Lack of Utility [R-07.2022]

## I.    **THE CLAIMED INVENTION IS THE FOCUS OF THE UTILITY REQUIREMENT**

The claimed invention is the focus of the assessment of whether an applicant has satisfied the utility requirement. Each claim (i.e., each "invention"), therefore, must be evaluated on its own merits for compliance with all statutory requirements. Generally speaking, however, a dependent claim will define an invention that has utility if the independent claim from which the dependent claim depends is drawn to the same statutory class of invention as the dependent claim and the independent claim defines an invention having utility. An exception to this general rule is where the utility specified for the invention defined in a dependent claim differs from that indicated for the invention defined in the independent claim from which the dependent claim depends. Where an applicant has established utility for a species that falls within an identified genus of compounds, and presents a generic claim covering the genus, as a general matter, that claim should be treated as being sufficient under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**. Only where it can be established that other species clearly encompassed by the claim do not have utility should a rejection be imposed on the generic claim. In such cases, the applicant should be encouraged to amend the generic claim so as to exclude the species that lack utility.

It is common and sensible for an applicant to identify several specific utilities for an invention, particularly where the invention is a product (e.g., a machine, an article of manufacture or a composition of matter). However, regardless of the category of invention that is claimed (e.g., product or process), an applicant need only make one credible assertion of specific utility for the claimed invention to satisfy **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  and **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824.html)**; additional statements of utility, even if not "credible," do not render the claimed invention lacking in utility. See, e.g., _Raytheon_ _v._ _Roper,_ 724 F.2d 951, 958, 220 USPQ 592, 598 (Fed. Cir. 1983), _cert. denied,_ 469 U.S. 835 (1984) ("When a properly claimed invention meets at least one stated objective, utility under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  is clearly shown."); _In re Gottlieb,_ 328 F.2d 1016, 1019, 140 USPQ 665, 668 (CCPA 1964) ("Having found that the antibiotic is useful for some purpose, it becomes unnecessary to decide whether it is in fact useful for the other purposes ‘indicated’ in the specification as possibly useful."); _In re Malachowski,_ 530 F.2d 1402, 189 USPQ 432 (CCPA 1976); _Hoffman_ _v._ _Klaus,_ 9 USPQ2d 1657 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1988). Thus, if applicant makes one credible assertion of utility, utility for the claimed invention as a whole is established.

Statements made by the applicant in the specification or incident to prosecution of the application before the Office cannot, standing alone, be the basis for a lack of utility rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  or **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824.html)**. _Tol-O-Matic, Inc._ _v._ _Proma Produkt-Und Mktg. Gesellschaft m.b.h.,_ 945 F.2d 1546, 1553, 20 USPQ2d 1332, 1338 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (It is not required that a particular characteristic set forth in the prosecution history be achieved in order to satisfy **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)** ). An applicant may include statements in the specification whose technical accuracy cannot be easily confirmed if those statements are not necessary to support the patentability of an invention with regard to any statutory basis. Thus, the Office should not require an applicant to strike nonessential statements relating to utility from a patent disclosure, regardless of the technical accuracy of the statement or assertion it presents. Office personnel should also be especially careful not to read into a claim unclaimed results, limitations or embodiments of an invention. See _Carl Zeiss Stiftung_ _v._ _Renishaw PLC,_ 945 F.2d 1173, 20 USPQ2d 1094 (Fed. Cir. 1991); _In re Krimmel,_ 292 F.2d 948, 130 USPQ 215 (CCPA 1961). Doing so can inappropriately change the relationship of an asserted utility to the claimed invention and raise issues not relevant to examination of that claim.

## II.    **IS THERE AN ASSERTED OR WELL-ESTABLISHED UTILITY FOR THE CLAIMED INVENTION?**

Upon initial examination, the examiner should review the specification to determine if there are any statements asserting that the claimed invention is useful for any particular purpose. A complete disclosure should include a statement which identifies a specific and substantial utility for the invention.

## A.    **_An Asserted Utility Must Be Specific and Substantial_**

A statement of specific and substantial utility should fully and clearly explain why the applicant asserts the invention is useful. Such statements will usually explain the purpose of or how the invention may be used (e.g., a compound is believed to be useful in the treatment of a particular disorder). Regardless of the form of statement of utility, it must enable one ordinarily skilled in the art to understand why the applicant asserts the claimed invention is useful.

Except where an invention has a well-established utility, the failure of an applicant to specifically identify why an invention is believed to be useful renders the claimed invention deficient under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  and **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824.html)**, first paragraph. In such cases, the applicant has failed to identify a "specific and substantial utility" for the claimed invention. For example, a statement that a composition has an unspecified "biological activity" or that does not explain why a composition with that activity is believed to be useful fails to set forth a "specific and substantial utility." _Brenner_ _v._ _Manson,_ 383 US 519, 148 USPQ 689 (1966) (general assertion of similarities to known compounds known to be useful without sufficient corresponding explanation why claimed compounds are believed to be similarly useful insufficient under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)** ); _In re Ziegler,_ 992 F.2d 1197, 1201, 26 USPQ2d 1600, 1604 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (disclosure that composition is "plastic-like" and can form "films" not sufficient to identify specific and substantial utility for invention); _In re Kirk,_ 376 F.2d 936, 153 USPQ 48 (CCPA 1967) (indication that compound is "biologically active" or has "biological properties" insufficient standing alone). See also _In re Joly,_ 376 F.2d 906, 153 USPQ 45 (CCPA 1967); _Kawai_ _v._ _Metlesics,_ 480 F.2d 880, 890, 178 USPQ 158, 165 (CCPA 1973) (contrasting description of invention as sedative which did suggest specific utility to general suggestion of "pharmacological effects on the central nervous system" which did not). In contrast, a disclosure that identifies a particular biological activity of a compound and explains how that activity can be utilized in a particular therapeutic application of the compound does contain an assertion of specific and substantial utility for the invention.

Situations where an applicant either fails to indicate why an invention is considered useful, or where the applicant inaccurately describes the utility should rarely arise. One reason for this is that applicants are required to disclose the best mode known to them of practicing the invention at the time they file their application. An applicant who omits a description of the specific and substantial utility of the invention, or who incompletely describes that utility, may encounter problems with respect to the best mode requirement of **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824.html)**, first paragraph.

## B.    **_No Statement of Utility for the Claimed Invention in the Specification Does Not Per Se Negate Utility_**

Occasionally, an applicant will not explicitly state in the specification or otherwise assert a specific and substantial utility for the claimed invention. If no statements can be found asserting a specific and substantial utility for the claimed invention in the specification, Office personnel should determine if the claimed invention has a well-established utility. An invention has a well-established utility if (i) a person of ordinary skill in the art would immediately appreciate why the invention is useful based on the characteristics of the invention (e.g., properties or applications of a product or process), and (ii) the utility is specific, substantial, and credible. If an invention has a well- established utility, rejections under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  and **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824.html)**, first paragraph, based on lack of utility should not be imposed. _In re Folkers,_ 344 F.2d 970, 145 USPQ 390 (CCPA 1965). For example, if an application teaches the cloning and characterization of the nucleotide sequence of a well-known protein such as insulin, and those skilled in the art at the time of filing knew that insulin had a well-established use, it would be improper to reject the claimed invention as lacking utility solely because of the omitted statement of specific and substantial utility.

If a person of ordinary skill would not immediately recognize a specific and substantial utility for the claimed invention (i.e., why it would be useful) based on the characteristics of the invention or statements made by the applicant, the examiner should reject the application under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  and under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824.html)**, first paragraph, as failing to identify a specific and substantial utility for the claimed invention. The rejection should clearly indicate that the basis of the rejection is that the application fails to identify a specific and substantial utility for the invention. The rejection should also specify that the applicant must reply by indicating why the invention is believed useful and where support for any subsequently asserted utility can be found in the specification as filed. See **[MPEP § 2701](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e271945.html)**.

If the applicant subsequently indicates why the invention is useful, Office personnel should review that assertion according to the standards articulated below for review of the credibility of an asserted utility.

## III.    **EVALUATING THE CREDIBILITY OF AN ASSERTED UTILITY**

## A.    **_An Asserted Utility Creates a Presumption of Utility_**

In most cases, an applicant’s assertion of utility creates a presumption of utility that will be sufficient to satisfy the utility requirement of **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**. See, e.g., _In re Jolles,_ 628 F.2d 1322, 206 USPQ 885 (CCPA 1980); _In re Irons,_ 340 F.2d 974, 144 USPQ 351 (CCPA 1965); _In re Langer,_ 503 F.2d 1380, 183 USPQ 288 (CCPA 1974); _In re Sichert,_ 566 F.2d 1154, 1159, 196 USPQ 209, 212-13 (CCPA 1977). As the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals stated in _In re Langer_:

> As a matter of Patent Office practice, a specification which contains a disclosure of utility which corresponds in scope to the subject matter sought to be patented must be taken as sufficient to satisfy the utility requirement of **[§ 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  for the entire claimed subject matter unless there is a reason for one skilled in the art to question the objective truth of the statement of utility or its scope.

_In re Langer,_ 503 F.2d at 1391, 183 USPQ at 297 (emphasis in original). The "Langer" test for utility has been used by both the Federal Circuit and the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals in evaluation of rejections under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824.html)**, first paragraph, where the rejection is based on a deficiency under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**. In _In re Brana,_ 51 F.3d 1560, 34 USPQ2d 1436 (Fed. Cir. 1995), the Federal Circuit explicitly adopted the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals formulation of the "Langer" standard for **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824.html)**, first paragraph rejections, as it was expressed in a slightly reworded format in _In re Marzocchi,_ 439 F.2d 220, 223, 169 USPQ 367, 369 (CCPA 1971), namely:

> [A] specification disclosure which contains a teaching of the manner and process of making and using the invention in terms which correspond in scope to those used in describing and defining the subject matter sought to be patented must be taken as in compliance with the enabling requirement of the first paragraph of **[§ 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824.html)**  unless there is reason to doubt the objective truth of the statements contained therein which must be relied on for enabling support. (emphasis added).

Thus, _Langer_ and subsequent cases direct the Office to presume that a statement of utility made by an applicant is true. See _In re Langer,_ 503 F.2d at 1391, 183 USPQ at 297; _In re Malachowski,_ 530 F.2d 1402, 1404, 189 USPQ 432, 435 (CCPA 1976); _In re Brana,_ 51 F.3d 1560, 34 USPQ2d 1436 (Fed. Cir. 1995). For obvious reasons of efficiency and in deference to an applicant’s understanding of the invention, when a statement of utility is evaluated, Office personnel should not begin by questioning the truth of the statement of utility. Instead, any inquiry must start by asking if there is any reason to question the truth of the statement of utility. This can be done by simply evaluating the logic of the statements made, taking into consideration any evidence cited by the applicant. If the asserted utility is credible (i.e., believable based on the record or the nature of the invention), a rejection based on "lack of utility" is not appropriate. Clearly, Office personnel should not begin an evaluation of utility by assuming that an asserted utility is likely to be false, based on the technical field of the invention or for other general reasons.

Compliance with **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  is a question of fact. _Raytheon_ _v._ _Roper,_ 724 F.2d 951, 956, 220 USPQ 592, 596 (Fed. Cir. 1983) _cert. denied,_ 469 U.S. 835 (1984). Thus, to overcome the presumption of truth that an assertion of utility by the applicant enjoys, Office personnel must establish that it is more likely than not that one of ordinary skill in the art would doubt (i.e., "question") the truth of the statement of utility. The evidentiary standard to be used throughout _ex parte_ examination in setting forth a rejection is a preponderance of the totality of the evidence under consideration. _In re Oetiker,_ 977 F.2d 1443, 1445, 24 USPQ2d 1443, 1444 (Fed. Cir. 1992) ("After evidence or argument is submitted by the applicant in response, patentability is determined on the totality of the record, by a preponderance of evidence with due consideration to persuasiveness of argument."); _In re Corkill,_ 771 F.2d 1496, 1500, 226 USPQ 1005, 1008 (Fed. Cir. 1985). A preponderance of the evidence exists when it suggests that it is more likely than not that the assertion in question is true. _Herman_ _v._ _Huddleston,_ 459 U.S. 375, 390 (1983). To do this, Office personnel must provide evidence sufficient to show that the statement of asserted utility would be considered "false" by a person of ordinary skill in the art. Of course, a person of ordinary skill must have the benefit of both facts and reasoning in order to assess the truth of a statement. This means that if the applicant has presented facts that support the reasoning used in asserting a utility, Office personnel must present countervailing facts and reasoning sufficient to establish that a person of ordinary skill would not believe the applicant’s assertion of utility. _In re Brana,_ 51 F.3d 1560, 34 USPQ2d 1436 (Fed. Cir. 1995). The initial evidentiary standard used during evaluation of this question is a preponderance of the evidence (i.e., the totality of facts and reasoning suggest that it is more likely than not that the statement of the applicant is false).

## B.    **_When Is an Asserted Utility Not Credible?_**

Where an applicant has specifically asserted that an invention has a particular utility, that assertion cannot simply be dismissed by Office personnel as being "wrong," even when there may be reason to believe that the assertion is not entirely accurate. Rather, Office personnel must determine if the assertion of utility is credible (i.e., whether the assertion of utility is believable to a person of ordinary skill in the art based on the totality of evidence and reasoning provided). An assertion is credible unless (A) the logic underlying the assertion is seriously flawed, or (B) the facts upon which the assertion is based are inconsistent with the logic underlying the assertion. Credibility as used in this context refers to the reliability of the statement based on the logic and facts that are offered by the applicant to support the assertion of utility.

One situation where an assertion of utility would not be considered credible is where a person of ordinary skill would consider the assertion to be "incredible in view of contemporary knowledge" and where nothing offered by the applicant would counter what contemporary knowledge might otherwise suggest. Office personnel should be careful, however, not to label certain types of inventions as "incredible" or "speculative" as such labels do not provide the correct focus for the evaluation of an assertion of utility. "Incredible utility" is a conclusion, not a starting point for analysis under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**. A conclusion that an asserted utility is incredible can be reached only after the Office has evaluated both the assertion of the applicant regarding utility and any evidentiary basis of that assertion. The Office should be particularly careful not to start with a presumption that an asserted utility is, _per se,_ "incredible" and then proceed to base a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  on that presumption.

Rejections under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  based on a lack of credible utility have been sustained by federal courts when, for example, the applicant failed to disclose any utility for the invention or asserted a utility that could only be true if it violated a scientific principle, such as the second law of thermodynamics, or a law of nature, or was wholly inconsistent with contemporary knowledge in the art. _In re Gazave,_ 379 F.2d 973, 978, 154 USPQ 92, 96 (CCPA 1967). Special care should be taken when assessing the credibility of an asserted therapeutic utility for a claimed invention. In such cases, a previous lack of success in treating a disease or condition, or the absence of a proven animal model for testing the effectiveness of drugs for treating a disorder in humans, should not, standing alone, serve as a basis for challenging the asserted utility under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**. See **[MPEP § 2107.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e200058.html)** for additional guidance with regard to therapeutic or pharmacological utilities.

## IV.    **INITIAL BURDEN IS ON THE OFFICE TO ESTABLISH A _PRIMA FACIE_ CASE AND PROVIDE EVIDENTIARY SUPPORT THEREOF**

To properly reject a claimed invention under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**, the Office must (A) make a _prima facie_ showing that the claimed invention lacks utility, and (B) provide a sufficient evidentiary basis for factual assumptions relied upon in establishing the _prima facie_ showing. _In re Gaubert,_ 524 F.2d 1222, 1224, 187 USPQ 664, 666 (CCPA 1975) "Accordingly, the PTO must do more than merely question operability - it must set forth factual reasons which would lead one skilled in the art to question the objective truth of  the statement of operability." If the Office cannot develop a proper _prima facie_ case and provide evidentiary support for a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**, a rejection on this ground should not be imposed. See, e.g., _In re Oetiker,_ 977 F.2d 1443, 1445, 24 USPQ2d 1443, 1444 (Fed. Cir. 1992) ("[T]he examiner bears the initial burden, on review of the prior art or on any other ground, of presenting a _prima facie_ case of unpatentability. If that burden is met, the burden of coming forward with evidence or argument shifts to the applicant.... If examination at the initial stage does not produce a _prima facie_ case of unpatentability, then without more the applicant is entitled to grant of the patent."). See also _Fregeau_ _v._ _Mossinghoff,_ 776 F.2d 1034, 227 USPQ 848 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (applying _prima facie_ case law to **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)** ); _In re Piasecki,_ 745 F.2d 1468, 223 USPQ 785 (Fed. Cir. 1984).

The _prima facie_ showing must be set forth in a well-reasoned statement. Any rejection based on lack of utility should include a detailed explanation why the claimed invention has no specific and substantial credible utility. Whenever possible, the examiner should provide documentary evidence regardless of publication date (e.g., scientific or technical journals, excerpts from treatises or books, or U.S. or foreign patents) to support the factual basis for the _prima facie_ showing of no specific and substantial credible utility. If documentary evidence is not available, the examiner should specifically explain the scientific basis for the examiner's factual conclusions.

Where the asserted utility is not specific or substantial, a _prima facie_ showing must establish that it is more likely than not that a person of ordinary skill in the art would not consider that any utility asserted by the applicant would be specific and substantial. The _prima facie_ showing must contain the following elements:

- (A) An explanation that clearly sets forth the reasoning used in concluding that the asserted utility for the claimed invention is neither both specific and substantial nor well-established;
- (B) Support for factual findings relied upon in reaching this conclusion; and
- (C) An evaluation of all relevant evidence of record, including utilities taught in the closest prior art.

Where the asserted specific and substantial utility is not credible, a _prima facie_ showing of no specific and substantial credible utility must establish that it is more likely than not that a person skilled in the art would not consider credible any specific and substantial utility asserted by the applicant for the claimed invention. The _prima facie_ showing must contain the following elements:

- (A) An explanation that clearly sets forth the reasoning used in concluding that the asserted specific and substantial utility is not credible;
- (B) Support for factual findings relied upon in reaching this conclusion; and
- (C) An evaluation of all relevant evidence of record, including utilities taught in the closest prior art.

Where no specific and substantial utility is disclosed or is well-established, a _prima facie_ showing of no specific and substantial utility need only establish that applicant has not asserted a utility and that, on the record before the examiner, there is no known well-established utility.

It is imperative that Office personnel use specificity in setting forth and initial rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  and support any factual conclusions made in the _prima facie_ showing.

By using specificity, the applicant will be able to identify the assumptions made by the Office in setting forth the rejection and will be able to address those assumptions properly.

Use form paragraphs **[7.04.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//fp7.04.01.html)** and **[7.05.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//fp7.05.02.html)** through **[7.05.04](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//fp.7.05.04.html)** to reject claims under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  for failure to satisfy the utility requirement.

# ¶ 7.05.02    Rejection, 35 U.S.C. 101, Utility Lacking

the claimed invention lacks patentable utility. **[1]**

### Examiner Note:

In bracket 1, provide explanation of lack of utility. See **[MPEP §§ 2105](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e197008.html)** - **[2107.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e200058.html)**.

# ¶ 7.05.03    Rejection, 35 U.S.C. 101, Inoperative

the disclosed invention is inoperative and therefore lacks utility. **[1]**

### Examiner Note:

In bracket 1, explain why invention is inoperative.

# ¶ 7.05.04    Utility Rejections Under 35 U.S.C. 101 and 35 U.S.C. 112(a) or 35 U.S.C. 112 (pre-AIA), First Paragraph

Claim **[1]** rejected under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  because the claimed invention is not supported by either a **[2]** asserted utility or a well established utility.

**[3]**

Claim **[4]** also rejected under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824.html)**, first paragraph. Specifically, because the claimed invention is not supported by either a **[5]** asserted utility or a well established utility for the reasons set forth above, one skilled in the art clearly would not know how to use the claimed invention.

### Examiner Note:

1. Where the specification would not enable one skilled in the art to make the claimed invention, or where alternative reasons support the enablement rejection, a separate rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824.html)**, first paragraph, enablement should be made using the factors set forth in _In re Wands_, 858 F.2d 731, 8 USPQ2d 1400 (Fed. Cir. 1988) and an undue experimentation analysis. See **[MPEP §§ 2164](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e215224.html)** - **[2164.08(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e216899.html)**.

2. Use Format A, B, or C below as appropriate.

Format A:- (a) Insert the same claim numbers in brackets 1 and 4.
- (b) Insert --specific and substantial-- in inserts 2 and 5.
- (c) In bracket 3, insert the explanation as to why the claimed invention is not supported by either a specific and substantial asserted utility or a well established utility.
- (d) Format A is to be used when there is no asserted utility and when there is an asserted utility but that utility is not specific and substantial.

Format B:- (a) Insert the same claim numbers in brackets 1 and 4.
- (b) Insert --credible-- in inserts 2 and 5.
- (c) In bracket 3, insert the explanation as to why the claimed invention is not supported by either a credible asserted utility or a well established utility.

Format C:- For claims that have multiple utilities, some of which are not specific and substantial, some of which are not credible, but none of which are specific, substantial and credible:
    - (a) Insert the same claim numbers in brackets 1 and 4.
    - (b) Insert --specific and substantial asserted utility, a credible-- in inserts 2 and 5.
    - (c) In bracket 3, insert the explanation as to why the claimed invention is not supported by either a specific and substantial asserted utility, a credible asserted utility or a well established utility. Each utility should be addressed.

## V.    **EVIDENTIARY REQUESTS BY AN EXAMINER TO SUPPORT AN ASSERTED UTILITY**

In appropriate situations the Office may require an applicant to substantiate an asserted utility for a claimed invention. See _In re Pottier,_ 376 F.2d 328, 330, 153 USPQ 407, 408 (CCPA 1967) ("When the operativeness of any process would be deemed unlikely by one of ordinary skill in the art, it is not improper for the examiner to call for evidence of operativeness."). See also _In re Jolles,_ 628 F.2d 1322, 1327, 206 USPQ 885, 890 (CCPA 1980); _In re Citron,_ 325 F.2d 248, 139 USPQ 516 (CCPA 1963); _In re Novak,_ 306 F.2d 924, 928, 134 USPQ 335, 337 (CCPA1962). In _In re Citron,_ the court held that when an "alleged utility appears to be incredible in the light of the knowledge of the art, or factually misleading, applicant must establish the asserted utility by acceptable proof." 325 F.2d at 253, 139 USPQ at 520. The court approved of the board’s decision which affirmed the rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  "in view of the art knowledge of the lack of a cure for cancer and the absence of any clinical data to substantiate the allegation." 325 F.2d at 252, 139 USPQ at 519 (emphasis in original). The court thus established a higher burden on the applicant where the statement of use is incredible or misleading. In such a case, the examiner should challenge the use and require sufficient evidence of operativeness. The purpose of this authority is to enable an applicant to cure an otherwise defective factual basis for the operability of an invention. Because this is a curative authority (e.g., evidence is requested to enable an applicant to support an assertion that is inconsistent with the facts of record in the application), Office personnel should indicate not only why the factual record is defective in relation to the assertions of the applicant, but also, where appropriate, what type of evidentiary showing can be provided by the applicant to remedy the problem.

Requests for additional evidence should be imposed rarely, and only if necessary to support the scientific credibility of the asserted utility (e.g., if the asserted utility is not consistent with the evidence of record and current scientific knowledge). As the Federal Circuit recently noted, "[o]nly after the PTO provides evidence showing that one of ordinary skill in the art would reasonably doubt the asserted utility does the burden shift to the applicant to provide rebuttal evidence sufficient to convince such a person of the invention’s asserted utility." _In re Brana,_ 51 F.3d 1560, 34 USPQ2d 1436 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (citing _In re Bundy,_ 642 F.2d 430, 433, 209 USPQ 48, 51 (CCPA 1981)). In _Brana,_ the court pointed out that the purpose of treating cancer with chemical compounds does not suggest, _per se,_ an incredible utility. Where the prior art disclosed "structurally similar compounds to those claimed by applicants which have been proven _in vivo_ to be effective as chemotherapeutic agents against various tumor models . . ., one skilled in the art would be without basis to reasonably doubt applicants’ asserted utility on its face." 51 F.3d at 1566, 34 USPQ2d at 1441. As courts have stated, "it is clearly improper for the examiner to make a demand for further test data, which as evidence would be essentially redundant and would seem to serve for nothing except perhaps to unduly burden the applicant." _In re Isaacs,_ 347 F.2d 887, 890, 146 USPQ 193, 196 (CCPA 1965).

## VI.    **CONSIDERATION OF A REPLY TO A _PRIMA FACIE_ REJECTION FOR LACK OF UTILITY**

If a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  has been properly imposed, along with a corresponding rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824.html)**, first paragraph, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut the _prima facie_ showing. _In re Oetiker,_ 977 F.2d 1443, 1445, 24 USPQ2d 1443, 1444 (Fed. Cir. 1992) ("The examiner bears the initial burden, on review of the prior art or on any other ground, of presenting a _prima facie_ case of unpatentability. If that burden is met, the burden of coming forward with evidence or argument shifts to the applicant. . . After evidence or argument is submitted by the applicant in response, patentability is determined on the totality of the record, by a preponderance of evidence with due consideration to persuasiveness of argument."). An applicant can do this using any combination of the following: amendments to the claims, arguments or reasoning, or new evidence submitted in an affidavit or declaration under **[37 CFR 1.132](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e323552.html)**, or in a printed publication. New evidence provided by an applicant must be relevant to the issues raised in the rejection. For example, declarations in which conclusions are set forth without establishing a nexus between those conclusions and the supporting evidence, or which merely express opinions, may be of limited probative value with regard to rebutting a _prima facie_ case. _In re Grunwell,_ 609 F.2d 486, 203 USPQ 1055 (CCPA 1979); _In re Buchner,_ 929 F.2d 660, 18 USPQ2d 1331 (Fed. Cir. 1991). See **[MPEP § 716.01(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e92557.html)** through **[MPEP § 716.01(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e92659.html)**.

If the applicant responds to the _prima facie_ rejection, Office personnel should review the original disclosure, any evidence relied upon in establishing the _prima facie_ showing, any claim amendments, and any new reasoning or evidence provided by the applicant in support of an asserted specific and substantial credible utility. It is essential for Office personnel to recognize, fully consider and respond to each substantive element of any response to a rejection based on lack of utility. Only where the totality of the record continues to show that the asserted utility is not specific, substantial, and credible should a rejection based on lack of utility be maintained. If the record as a whole would make it more likely than not that the asserted utility for the claimed invention would be considered credible by a person of ordinary skill in the art, the Office cannot maintain the rejection. _In re Rinehart,_ 531 F.2d 1048, 1052, 189 USPQ 143, 147 (CCPA 1976).

## VII.    **EVALUATION OF EVIDENCE RELATED TO UTILITY**

There is no predetermined amount or character of evidence that must be provided by an applicant to support an asserted utility, therapeutic or otherwise. Rather, the character and amount of evidence needed to support an asserted utility will vary depending on what is claimed _(Ex parte Ferguson,_ 117 USPQ 229 (Bd. App. 1957)), and whether the asserted utility appears to contravene established scientific principles and beliefs. _In re Gazave,_ 379 F.2d 973, 978, 154 USPQ 92, 96 (CCPA 1967); _In re Chilowsky,_ 229 F.2d 457, 462, 108 USPQ 321, 325 (CCPA 1956). Furthermore, the applicant does not have to provide evidence sufficient to establish that an asserted utility is true "beyond a reasonable doubt." _In re Irons,_ 340 F.2d 974, 978, 144 USPQ 351, 354 (CCPA 1965). Nor must an applicant provide evidence such that it establishes an asserted utility as a matter of statistical certainty. _Nelson_ _v._ _Bowler,_ 626 F.2d 853, 856-57, 206 USPQ 881, 883-84 (CCPA 1980) (reversing the Board and rejecting Bowler’s arguments that the evidence of utility was statistically insignificant. The court pointed out that a rigorous correlation is not necessary when the test is reasonably predictive of the response). See also _Rey-Bellet_ _v._ _Englehardt,_ 493 F.2d 1380, 181 USPQ 453 (CCPA 1974) (data from animal testing is relevant to asserted human therapeutic utility if there is a "satisfactory correlation between the effect on the animal and that ultimately observed in human beings"). Instead, evidence will be sufficient if, considered as a whole, it leads a person of ordinary skill in the art to conclude that the asserted utility is more likely than not true.

# 2107.03    Special Considerations for Asserted Therapeutic or Pharmacological Utilities [R-08.2012]

The federal courts have consistently reversed rejections by the Office asserting a lack of utility for inventions claiming a pharmacological or therapeutic utility where an applicant has provided evidence that reasonably supports such a utility. In view of this, Office personnel should be particularly careful in their review of evidence provided in support of an asserted therapeutic or pharmacological utility.

## I.    **A REASONABLE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE EVIDENCE AND THE ASSERTED UTILITY IS SUFFICIENT**

As a general matter, evidence of pharmacological or other biological activity of a compound will be relevant to an asserted therapeutic use if there is a reasonable correlation between the activity in question and the asserted utility. _Cross_ _v. Iizuka,_ 753 F.2d 1040, 224 USPQ 739 (Fed. Cir. 1985); _In re Jolles,_ 628 F.2d 1322, 206 USPQ 885 (CCPA 1980); _Nelson_ _v._ _Bowler,_ 626 F.2d 853, 206 USPQ 881 (CCPA 1980). An applicant can establish this reasonable correlation by relying on statistically relevant data documenting the activity of a compound or composition, arguments or reasoning, documentary evidence (e.g., articles in scientific journals), or any combination thereof. The applicant does not have to prove that a correlation exists between a particular activity and an asserted therapeutic use of a compound as a matter of statistical certainty, nor does he or she have to provide actual evidence of success in treating humans where such a utility is asserted. Instead, as the courts have repeatedly held, all that is required is a reasonable correlation between the activity and the asserted use. _Nelson_ _v._ _Bowler,_ 626 F.2d 853, 857, 206 USPQ 881, 884 (CCPA 1980).

## II.    **STRUCTURAL SIMILARITY TO COMPOUNDS WITH ESTABLISHED UTILITY**

Courts have routinely found evidence of structural similarity to a compound known to have a particular therapeutic or pharmacological utility as being supportive of an assertion of therapeutic utility for a new compound. In _In re Jolles,_ 628 F.2d 1322, 206 USPQ 885 (CCPA 1980), the claimed compounds were found to have utility based on a finding of a close structural relationship to daunorubicin and doxorubicin and shared pharmacological activity with those compounds, both of which were known to be useful in cancer chemotherapy. The evidence of close structural similarity with the known compounds was presented in conjunction with evidence demonstrating substantial activity of the claimed compounds in animals customarily employed for screening anticancer agents. Such evidence should be given appropriate weight in determining whether one skilled in the art would find the asserted utility credible. Office personnel should evaluate not only the existence of the structural relationship, but also the reasoning used by the applicant or a declarant to explain why that structural similarity is believed to be relevant to the applicant's assertion of utility.

## III.    **DATA FROM _IN VITRO_ OR ANIMAL TESTING IS GENERALLY SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT THERAPEUTIC UTILITY**

If reasonably correlated to the particular therapeutic or pharmacological utility, data generated using _in vitro_ assays, or from testing in an animal model or a combination thereof almost invariably will be sufficient to establish therapeutic or pharmacological utility for a compound, composition or process. A cursory review of cases involving therapeutic inventions where **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  was the dispositive issue illustrates the fact that the federal courts are not particularly receptive to rejections under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  based on inoperability. Most striking is the fact that in those cases where an applicant supplied a reasonable evidentiary showing supporting an asserted therapeutic utility, almost uniformly the **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)** -based rejection was reversed. See, e.g., _In re Brana,_ 51 F.3d 1560, 34 USPQ 1436 (Fed. Cir. 1995); _Cross_ _v. Iizuka,_ 753 F.2d 1040, 224 USPQ 739 (Fed. Cir. 1985); _In re Jolles,_ 628 F.2d 1322, 206 USPQ 885 (CCPA 1980); _Nelson_ _v._ _Bowler,_ 626 F.2d 853, 856, 206 USPQ 881, 883 (CCPA 1980); _In re Malachowski,_ 530 F.2d 1402, 189 USPQ 432 (CCPA 1976); _In re Gaubert,_ 530 F.2d 1402, 189 USPQ 432 (CCPA 1975); _In re Gazave,_ 379 F.2d 973, 154 USPQ 92 (CCPA 1967); _In re Hartop,_ 311 F.2d 249, 135 USPQ 419 (CCPA 1962); _In re Krimmel,_ 292 F.2d 948, 130 USPQ 215 (CCPA 1961). Only in those cases where the applicant was unable to come forward with any relevant evidence to rebut a finding by the Office that the claimed invention was inoperative was a **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  rejection affirmed by the court. _In re Citron,_ 325 F.2d 248, 253, 139 USPQ 516, 520 (CCPA 1963) (therapeutic utility for an uncharacterized biological extract not supported or scientifically credible); _In re Buting,_ 418 F.2d 540, 543, 163 USPQ 689, 690 (CCPA 1969) (record did not establish a credible basis for the assertion that the single class of compounds in question would be useful in treating disparate types of cancers); _In re Novak,_ 306 F.2d 924, 134 USPQ 335 (CCPA 1962) (claimed compounds did not have capacity to effect physiological activity upon which utility claim based). Contrast, however, _In re Buting_ to _In re Gardner,_ 475 F.2d 1389, 177 USPQ 396 (CCPA 1973), _reh'g denied,_ 480 F.2d 879 (CCPA 1973), in which the court held that utility for a genus was found to be supported through a showing of utility for one species. In no case has a federal court required an applicant to support an asserted utility with data from human clinical trials.

If an applicant provides data, whether from _in vitro_ assays or animal tests or both, to support an asserted utility, and an explanation of why that data supports the asserted utility, the Office will determine if the data and the explanation would be viewed by one skilled in the art as being reasonably predictive of the asserted utility. See, e.g., _Ex parte Maas,_ 9 USPQ2d 1746 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1987); _Ex parte Balzarini,_ 21 USPQ2d 1892 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1991). Office personnel must be careful to evaluate all factors that might influence the conclusions of a person of ordinary skill in the art as to this question, including the test parameters, choice of animal, relationship of the activity to the particular disorder to be treated, characteristics of the compound or composition, relative significance of the data provided and, most importantly, the explanation offered by the applicant as to why the information provided is believed to support the asserted utility. If the data supplied is consistent with the asserted utility, the Office cannot maintain a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**.

Evidence does not have to be in the form of data from an art-recognized animal model for the particular disease or disease condition to which the asserted utility relates. Data from any test that the applicant reasonably correlates to the asserted utility should be evaluated substantively. Thus, an applicant may provide data generated using a particular animal model with an appropriate explanation as to why that data supports the asserted utility. The absence of a certification that the test in question is an industry-accepted model is not dispositive of whether data from an animal model is in fact relevant to the asserted utility. Thus, if one skilled in the art would accept the animal tests as being reasonably predictive of utility in humans, evidence from those tests should be considered sufficient to support the credibility of the asserted utility. _In re Hartop,_ 311 F.2d 249, 135 USPQ 419 (CCPA 1962); _In re Krimmel,_ 292 F.2d 948, 953, 130 USPQ 215, 219 (CCPA 1961); _Ex parte Krepelka,_ 231 USPQ 746 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1986). Office personnel should be careful not to find evidence unpersuasive simply because no animal model for the human disease condition had been established prior to the filing of the application. See _In re Chilowsky,_ 229 F.2d 457, 461, 108 USPQ 321, 325 (CCPA 1956) ("The mere fact that something has not previously been done clearly is not, in itself, a sufficient basis for rejecting all applications purporting to disclose how to do it."); _In re Wooddy,_ 331 F.2d 636, 639, 141 USPQ 518, 520 (CCPA 1964) ("It appears that no one on earth is certain as of the present whether the process claimed will operate in the manner claimed. Yet absolute certainty is not required by the law. The mere fact that something has not previously been done clearly is not, in itself, a sufficient basis for rejecting all applications purporting to disclose how to do it.").

## IV.    **HUMAN CLINICAL DATA**

Office personnel should not impose on applicants the unnecessary burden of providing evidence from human clinical trials. There is no decisional law that requires an applicant to provide data from human clinical trials to establish utility for an invention related to treatment of human disorders (see _In re Isaacs,_ 347 F.2d 889, 146 USPQ 193 (CCPA 1963); _In re Langer,_ 503 F.2d 1380, 183 USPQ 288 (CCPA 1974)), even with respect to situations where no art-recognized animal models existed for the human disease encompassed by the claims. _Ex parte Balzarini,_ 21 USPQ2d 1892 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1991) (human clinical data is not required to demonstrate the utility of the claimed invention, even though those skilled in the art might not accept other evidence to establish the efficacy of the claimed therapeutic compositions and the operativeness of the claimed methods of treating humans). Before a drug can enter human clinical trials, the sponsor, often the applicant, must provide a convincing rationale to those especially skilled in the art (e.g., the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)) that the investigation may be successful. Such a rationale would provide a basis for the sponsor’s expectation that the investigation may be successful. In order to determine a protocol for phase I testing, the first phase of clinical investigation, some credible rationale of how the drug might be effective or could be effective would be necessary. Thus, as a general rule, if an applicant has initiated human clinical trials for a therapeutic product or process, Office personnel should presume that the applicant has established that the subject matter of that trial is reasonably predictive of having the asserted therapeutic utility.

## V.    **SAFETY AND EFFICACY CONSIDERATIONS**

The Office must confine its review of patent applications to the statutory requirements of the patent law. Other agencies of the government have been assigned the responsibility of ensuring conformance to standards established by statute for the advertisement, use, sale or distribution of drugs. The FDA pursues a two-prong test to provide approval for testing. Under that test, a sponsor must show that the investigation does not pose an unreasonable and significant risk of illness or injury and that there is an acceptable rationale for the study. As a review matter, there must be a rationale for believing that the compound could be effective. If the use reviewed by the FDA is not set forth in the specification, FDA review may not satisfy **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**. However, if the reviewed use is one set forth in the specification, Office personnel must be extremely hesitant to challenge utility. In such a situation, experts at the FDA have assessed the rationale for the drug or research study upon which an asserted utility is based and found it satisfactory. Thus, in challenging utility, Office personnel must be able to carry their burden that there is no sound rationale for the asserted utility even though experts designated by Congress to decide the issue have come to an opposite conclusion. "FDA approval, however, is not a prerequisite for finding a compound useful within the meaning of the patent laws." _In re Brana,_ 51 F.3d 1560, 34 USPQ2d 1436 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (citing _Scott_ _v._ _Finney,_ 34 F.3d 1058, 1063, 32 USPQ2d 1115, 1120 (Fed. Cir. 1994)).

Thus, while an applicant may on occasion need to provide evidence to show that an invention will work as claimed, it is improper for Office personnel to request evidence of safety in the treatment of humans, or regarding the degree of effectiveness. See _In re Sichert,_ 566 F.2d 1154, 196 USPQ 209 (CCPA 1977); _In re Hartop,_ 311 F.2d 249, 135 USPQ 419 (CCPA 1962); _In re Anthony,_ 414 F.2d 1383, 162 USPQ 594 (CCPA 1969); _In re Watson,_ 517 F.2d 465, 186 USPQ 11 (CCPA 1975); _In re Krimmel,_ 292 F.2d 948, 130 USPQ 215 (CCPA 1961); _Ex parte Jovanovics,_ 211 USPQ 907 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1981).

## VI.    **TREATMENT OF SPECIFIC DISEASE CONDITIONS**

Claims directed to a method of treating or curing a disease for which there have been no previously successful treatments or cures warrant careful review for compliance with **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**. The credibility of an asserted utility for treating a human disorder may be more difficult to establish where current scientific understanding suggests that such a task would be impossible. Such a determination has always required a good understanding of the state of the art as of the time that the invention was made. For example, prior to the 1980’s, there were a number of cases where an asserted use in treating cancer in humans was viewed as "incredible." _In re Jolles,_ 628 F.2d 1322, 206 USPQ 885 (CCPA 1980); _In re Buting,_ 418 F.2d 540, 163 USPQ 689 (CCPA 1969); _Ex parte Stevens,_ 16 USPQ2d 1379 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1990); _Ex parte Busse,_ 1 USPQ2d 1908 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1986); _Ex parte Krepelka,_ 231 USPQ 746 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1986); _Ex parte Jovanovics,_ 211 USPQ 907 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1981). The fact that there is no known cure for a disease, however, cannot serve as the basis for a conclusion that such an invention lacks utility. Rather, Office personnel must determine if the asserted utility for the invention is credible based on the information disclosed in the application. Only those claims for which an asserted utility is not credible should be rejected. In such cases, the Office should carefully review what is being claimed by the applicant. An assertion that the claimed invention is useful in treating a symptom of an incurable disease may be considered credible by a person of ordinary skill in the art on the basis of a fairly modest amount of evidence or support. In contrast, an assertion that the claimed invention will be useful in "curing" the disease may require a significantly greater amount of evidentiary support to be considered credible by a person of ordinary skill in the art. _In re Sichert,_ 566 F.2d 1154, 196 USPQ 209 (CCPA 1977); _In re Jolles,_ 628 F.2d 1322, 206 USPQ 885 (CCPA 1980). See also _Ex parte Ferguson,_ 117 USPQ 229 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1957).

In these cases, it is important to note that the Food and Drug Administration has promulgated regulations that enable a party to conduct clinical trials for drugs used to treat life threatening and severely-debilitating illnesses, even where no alternative therapy exists. See 21 CFR 312.80-88 (1994). Implicit in these regulations is the recognition that experts qualified to evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutics can and often do find a sufficient basis to conduct clinical trials of drugs for incurable or previously untreatable illnesses. Thus, affidavit evidence from experts in the art indicating that there is a reasonable expectation of success, supported by sound reasoning, usually should be sufficient to establish that such a utility is credible.

# 2108    [Reserved]

# 2109    Inventorship [R-01.2024]

The requirement that the applicant for a patent in an application filed before September 16, 2012 be the inventor(s) (except as otherwise provided in **[pre-AIA 37 CFR 1.41](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e317666.html)** ), and that the inventor or each joint inventor be identified in applications filed on or after September 16, 2012, are characteristics of U.S. patent law not generally shared by other countries. Consequently, foreign applicants may misunderstand U.S. law regarding naming of the actual inventors causing an error in the inventorship of a U.S. application that may claim priority to a previous foreign application under **[35 U.S.C. 119](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302921.html)**. A request under **[37 CFR 1.48](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e317930.html)**  is required to correct any error in the inventorship in the U.S. application as filed. See **[MPEP § 602.01(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e4830ss602.html)** _et seq._ Foreign applicants may need to be reminded of the requirement for the same inventor or at least one common joint inventor between a U.S. application and a **[35 U.S.C. 119](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302921.html)**  priority application. See **[MPEP § 213.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch200_d1ff72_1b289_213.html)**, subsection II.

If a determination is made that the inventive entity named in a U.S. application is not correct, such as when a request under **[37 CFR 1.48(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e317930.html)**  is not granted or is not entered for technical reasons, but the admission therein regarding the error in inventorship is uncontroverted, a rejection should be made on this basis.

## I.    **NAMING INVENTORSHIP**

The inventor, or each individual who is a joint inventor of a claimed invention, in an application for patent (other than a provisional application) must execute an oath or declaration directed to the application, except as provided for in **[37 CFR 1.64](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//aia_d0e319924.html)**.

See **[MPEP § 602.01(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch600_d1ffbe_2a437_2a7.html)** for the requirements of an original oath or declaration in an application filed before September 16, 2012.

For applications filed before September 16, 2012, **[pre-AIA 37 CFR 1.41(a)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e317666.html##d0e317678)**  defines the inventorship of a nonprovisional application as that inventorship set forth in the oath or declaration filed to comply with the requirements of **[pre-AIA 37 CFR 1.63](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e319759.html)**, except as otherwise provided. Thus the party or parties executing an oath or declaration under **[pre-AIA 37 CFR 1.63](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e319759.html)**  are presumed to be the inventors. _Driscoll v. Cebalo,_ 5 USPQ2d 1477, 1481 (Bd. Pat. Inter. 1982); _In re DeBaun,_ 687 F.2d 459, 463, 214 USPQ 933, 936 (CCPA 1982) (The inventor of an element, _per se,_ and the inventor of that element as used in a combination may differ. "The existence of combination claims does not evidence inventorship by the patentee of the individual elements or subcombinations thereof if the latter are not separately claimed apart from the combination." (quoting _In re Facius,_ 408 F.2d 1396, 1406, 161 USPQ 294, 301 (CCPA 1969) (emphasis in original)); _Brader v. Schaeffer,_ 193 USPQ 627, 631 (Bd. Pat. Inter. 1976) (in regard to an inventorship correction: "[a]s between inventors their word is normally taken as to who are the actual inventors" when there is no disagreement).

## II.    **AN INVENTOR MUST CONTRIBUTE TO THE CONCEPTION OF THE INVENTION**

The definition for inventorship can be simply stated: "The threshold question in determining inventorship is who conceived the invention. Unless a person contributes to the conception of the invention, he is not an inventor. … Insofar as defining an inventor is concerned, reduction to practice, _per se,_ is irrelevant [except for simultaneous conception and reduction to practice, _Fiers v. Revel,_ 984 F.2d 1164, 1168, 25 USPQ2d 1601, 1604-05 (Fed. Cir. 1993)]. One must contribute to the conception to be an inventor." _In re Hardee,_ 223 USPQ 1122, 1123 (Comm’r Pat. 1984). A person who shares in the conception of a claimed invention is a joint inventor of that invention. _In re VerHoef,_ 888 F.3d 1362, 1366-67, 126 F.2d 1561, 1564-65 (Fed. Cir. 2018). See also _Board of Education ex rel. Board of Trustees of Florida State Univ. v. American Bioscience Inc.,_ 333 F.3d 1330, 1340, 67 USPQ2d 1252, 1259 (Fed. Cir. 2003) ("Invention requires conception." With regard to the inventorship of chemical compounds, an inventor must have a conception of the specific compounds being claimed. "[G]eneral knowledge regarding the anticipated biological properties of groups of complex chemical compounds is insufficient to confer inventorship status with respect to specifically claimed compounds."); _Ex parte Smernoff,_ 215 USPQ 545, 547 (Bd. App. 1982) ("one who suggests an idea of a result to be accomplished, rather than the means of accomplishing it, is not an coinventor"). See **[MPEP § 2138.04](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e207607.html)** - **[§ 2138.05](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e207753.html)** for a discussion of what evidence is required to establish conception or reduction to practice.

## III.    **THE INVENTOR IS NOT REQUIRED TO REDUCE THE INVENTION TO PRACTICE**

Difficulties arise in separating members of a team effort, where each member of the team has contributed something, into those members that actually contributed to the conception of the invention, such as the physical structure or operative steps, from those members that merely acted under the direction and supervision of the conceivers. _Fritsch v. Lin,_ 21 USPQ2d 1737, 1739 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1991) (The inventor "took no part in developing the procedures…for expressing the EPO gene in mammalian host cells and isolating the resulting EPO product." However, "it is not essential for the inventor to be personally involved in carrying out process steps…where implementation of those steps does not require the exercise of inventive skill."); _In re DeBaun,_ 687 F.2d 459, 463, 214 USPQ 933, 936 (CCPA 1982) ("there is no requirement that the inventor be the one to reduce the invention to practice so long as the reduction to practice was done on his behalf").

See also _Mattor_ _v._ _Coolegem,_ 530 F.2d 1391, 1395, 189 USPQ 201, 204 (CCPA 1976) (one following oral instructions is viewed as merely a technician); _Tucker v. Naito,_ 188 USPQ 260, 263 (Bd. Pat. Inter. 1975) (inventors need not "personally construct and test their invention"); _Davis_ _v._ _Carrier,_ 81 F.2d 250, 252, 28 USPQ 227, 229 (CCPA 1936) (noninventor’s work was merely that of a skilled mechanic carrying out the details of a plan devised by another).

## IV.    **JOINT INVENTORSHIP**

Pursuant to **[35 U.S.C. 116](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302886912.html)**, "[w]hen an invention is made by two or more persons jointly, they shall apply for patent jointly and each make the required oath, except as otherwise provided in this title. Inventors may apply for a patent jointly even though (1) they did not physically work together or at the same time, (2) each did not make the same type or amount of contribution, or (3) each did not make a contribution to the subject matter of every claim of the patent."

The inventive entity for a particular application is based on some contribution to at least one of the claims made by each of the named joint inventors. See **[MPEP § 2109.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d2c1f8_278a7_1e6.html)** for a detailed discussion of the requirements for joint inventorship. See **[MPEP § 602.09](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch600_d1ff6a_1ba4a_ff.html)** regarding inquiries about the inventorship of each claimed invention and regarding correction of inventorship when an application is amended such that one (or more) of the named joint inventors is no longer a joint inventor of the subject matter of any claim remaining in the application.

## V.    **INVENTORSHIP "BY ANOTHER"**

Inventorship is generally "by another" where there are different inventive entities and there is at least one inventor that is not in common. For information relating to inventorship by "another" involving different inventive entities with at least one inventor in common, see **[MPEP § 2153.01(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d20033_24e66_2ac.html)** for applications subject to examination under the first inventor to file (FITF) provisions of the AIA, and **[MPEP § 2136.04](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e206254.html)** for applications subject to examination under pre-AIA law.

## VI.    **EXAMINATION OF CONTINUING APPLICATION COMMONLY OWNED WITH ABANDONED PARENT APPLICATION TO WHICH BENEFIT IS CLAIMED UNDER 35 U.S.C. 120**

An application claiming the benefit of a prior filed copending national or international application under **[35 U.S.C. 120](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e303023313.html)**  must name as an inventor at least one inventor named in the prior filed application. The prior filed application must also disclose the named inventor’s invention claimed in at least one claim of the later filed application in the manner provided by **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**  for applications filed on or after September 16, 2012, or **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824.html)**, first paragraph for applications filed prior to September 16, 2012. This practice contrasts with the practice in effect prior to November 8, 1984 (the date of enactment of Public Law 98-622) where the inventorship entity in each of the applications was required to be the same for benefit under **[35 U.S.C. 120](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e303023313.html)**.

So long as the applications have at least one inventor in common and the other requirements are met, the Office will permit a claim for **[35 U.S.C. 120](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e303023313.html)**  benefit without any additional submissions or notifications from applicants regarding inventorship differences.

In addition to the normal examination conducted by the examiner, the examiner must examine the earlier filed application to determine if the earlier and later applications have at least one inventor in common and that the other **[35 U.S.C. 120](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e303023313.html)**  and **[37 CFR 1.78](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//aia_d0e320662.html)**  requirements are met. See **[MPEP § 211](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch200_d1ff71_1bd25_18b.html)** _et seq._ The claim for **[35 U.S.C. 120](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e303023313.html)**  benefit will be permitted without examination of the earlier application for disclosure and support of at least one claim of the later filed application under **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**  unless it becomes necessary to do so, for example, because of an intervening reference.

## VII.    **AN INVENTOR OR JOINT INVENTOR MUST BE A NATURAL PERSON**

"The Patent Act expressly provides that inventors are ‘individuals.’ Since 2011, with the passage of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, the Patent Act has defined an ‘inventor’ as the _‘individual’_ or, if a joint invention, the _individuals_ collectively who invented or discovered the subject matter of the invention.’ **[35 U.S.C. 100(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302338313.html##d0e302367313)**  (emphasis added). The Act similarly defines ‘joint inventor and ‘coinventor’ as ‘any 1 of the individuals who invented or discovered the subject matter of a joint invention.’ **[§ 100(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302338313.html##al_d1d85b_11e0c_133)** (emphasis added). In describing the statements required of an inventor when applying for a patent, the statute consistently refers to inventors and co-inventors as ‘individuals.’" _Thaler v. Vidal,_ 43 F.4th 1207, 1211 (Fed. Cir. 2022).

**[35 U.S.C. 115](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302875912.html)**  requires that an application filed under **[35 U.S.C. 111(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//pltd0e302673aia.html##pltd0e302678aia)**  shall include the name of the inventor or inventors. **[35 U.S.C. 100(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302338313.html##d0e302367313)**  defines the term "inventor" as the individual or, if a joint invention, the individuals collectively who invented or discovered the subject matter of the invention. **[35 U.S.C. 100(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302338313.html##al_d1d85b_11e0c_133)**  defines the terms "joint inventor" and "coinventor" as any one of the individuals who invented or discovered the subject matter of a joint invention. As provided in **[37 CFR 1.41(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//aia_d0e317666.html##aia_d0e317757)**, an applicant may name the inventorship of a non-provisional application under **[35 U.S.C. 111(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//pltd0e302673aia.html##pltd0e302678aia)**  in the Application Data Sheet in accordance with **[37 CFR 1.76](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//plt_d0e320348.html)**, or in the inventor’s oath or declaration in accordance with **[37 CFR 1.63](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//aia_d0e319759.html)**.

The inventor or joint inventors named on a patent or patent application must be a natural person, i.e., a human being. See _Univ. of Utah v. Max-Planck-Gesellschaft zur Forderung der Wissenschaften E.V.,_ 734 F.3d 1315, 1323, 107 USPQ2d 1989, 1994 (Fed. Cir. 2013) ("[I]nventors must be natural persons and cannot be corporations or sovereigns.") (emphasis added); _Beech Aircraft Corp. v. EDO Corp.,_ 990 F.2d 1237, 1248, 26 USPQ2d 1572, 1581 (Fed. Cir. 1993) ("[O]nly natural persons can be ‘inventors.’").

#### _35 U.S.C. 116   Inventors._

_[Editor Note: Applicable to proceedings commenced on or after Sept. 16, 2012. See **[35 U.S.C. 116 (pre‑AIA)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302886.html)**  for the law otherwise applicable.]_

- (a) JOINT INVENTIONS.—When an invention is made by two or more persons jointly, they shall apply for patent jointly and each make the required oath, except as otherwise provided in this title. Inventors may apply for a patent jointly even though (1) they did not physically work together or at the same time, (2) each did not make the same type or amount of contribution, or (3) each did not make a contribution to the subject matter of every claim of the patent.
- (b) OMITTED INVENTOR.—If a joint inventor refuses to join in an application for patent or cannot be found or reached after diligent effort, the application may be made by the other inventor on behalf of himself and the omitted inventor. The Director, on proof of the pertinent facts and after such notice to the omitted inventor as he prescribes, may grant a patent to the inventor making the application, subject to the same rights which the omitted inventor would have had if he had been joined. The omitted inventor may subsequently join in the application.
- (c) CORRECTION OF ERRORS IN APPLICATION.—Whenever through error a person is named in an application for patent as the inventor, or through an error an inventor is not named in an application, the Director may permit the application to be amended accordingly, under such terms as he prescribes.

#### _35 U.S.C. 116 (pre‑AIA)  Inventors._

_[Editor Note: **Not applicable** to proceedings commenced on or after September 16, 2012. See **[35 U.S.C. 116](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302886912.html)**  for the law otherwise applicable.]_

When an invention is made by two or more persons jointly, they shall apply for patent jointly and each make the required oath, except as otherwise provided in this title. Inventors may apply for a patent jointly even though (1) they did not physically work together or at the same time, (2) each did not make the same type or amount of contribution, or (3) each did not make a contribution to the subject matter of every claim of the patent.

If a joint inventor refuses to join in an application for patent or cannot be found or reached after diligent effort, the application may be made by the other inventor on behalf of himself and the omitted inventor. The Director, on proof of the pertinent facts and after such notice to the omitted inventor as he prescribes, may grant a patent to the inventor making the application, subject to the same rights which the omitted inventor would have had if he had been joined. The omitted inventor may subsequently join in the application.

Whenever through error a person is named in an application for patent as the inventor, or through an error an inventor is not named in an application, and such error arose without any deceptive intention on his part, the Director may permit the application to be amended accordingly, under such terms as he prescribes.

A person who shares in the conception of a claimed invention is a joint inventor of that invention. _In re VerHoef,_ 888 F.3d 1362, 1366-67, 126 F.2d 1561, 1564-65 (Fed. Cir. 2018) (person who contributed the idea of a figure eight loop in the claimed dog harness, which figure eight loop is an essential feature of the invention not insignificant in quality or well-known in the art, should have been named as a joint inventor).

"Inventors may apply for a patent jointly even though (1) they did not physically work together or at the same time, (2) each did not make the same type or amount of contribution, or (3) each did not make a contribution to the subject matter of every claim of the patent." **[35 U.S.C. 116](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302886.html)**.

It is not necessary that joint inventors physically work together on a project, and it is permissible for one inventor to "take a step at one time, the other an approach at different times." (_Monsanto Co. v. Kamp,_ 269 F. Supp. 818, 824, 154 USPQ 259, 262 (D.D.C. 1967)). However, "the statute neither states nor implies that two inventors can be ‘joint inventors’ if they have had no contact whatsoever and are completely unaware of each other's work." What is required is some "quantum of collaboration or connection." In other words, "[f]or persons to be joint inventors under **[Section 116](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302886.html)**, there must be some element of joint behavior, such as collaboration or working under common direction, one inventor seeing a relevant report and building upon it or hearing another’s suggestion at a meeting." _Kimberly-Clark Corp._ _v._ _Procter & Gamble Distrib. Co.,_ 973 F.2d 911, 916-17, 23 USPQ2d 1921, 1925-26 (Fed. Cir. 1992); _Moler v. Purdy,_ 131 USPQ 276, 279 (Bd. Pat. Inter. 1960) ("it is not necessary that the inventive concept come to both [joint inventors] at the same time").

While each joint inventor must generally contribute to the conception of the invention, each joint inventor does not have to "make the same type or amount of contribution" to the invention. "The fact that each of the inventors play a different role and that the contribution of one may not be as great as that of another does not detract from the fact that the invention is joint, if each makes some original contribution, though partial, to the final solution of the problem." _Monsanto Co. v. Kamp,_ 269 F. Supp. at 824, 154 USPQ at 262. When a joint inventor contributed to the conception of an invention, publication of the joint inventor’s contribution before the date of conception of the total invention does not necessarily defeat joint inventorship of that invention. See _Dana-Farber Cancer Inst., Inc. v. Ono Pharm. Co.,_ 964 F.3d 1365, 1371-73, 2020 USPQ2d 10775 (Fed. Cir. 2020) ("a collaborative enterprise is not negated by a joint inventor disclosing ideas less than the total invention to others, especially when, as here, the collaborators had worked together for around one year prior to the disclosure, and the disclosure occurred just a few weeks prior to conception. Inventorship of a complex invention may depend on partial contributions to conception over time, and there is no principled reason to discount genuine contributions made by collaborators because portions of that work were published prior to conception for the benefit of the public.").

A joint inventor or coinventor need not make a contribution to every claim of a patent; a contribution to one claim is enough. "The contributor of any disclosed means of a means-plus-function claim element is a joint inventor as to that claim, unless one asserting sole inventorship can show that the contribution of that means was simply a reduction to practice of the sole inventor’s broader concept." _Ethicon Inc. v. United States Surgical Corp.,_ 135 F.3d 1456, 1460-63, 45 USPQ2d 1545, 1548-1551 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (The electronics technician who contributed to one of the two alternative structures in the specification to define "the means for detaining" in a claim limitation was held to be a joint inventor.). In addition, there is no requirement that all the inventors be joint inventors of the subject matter of any one claim.

See **[MPEP § 602.09](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch600_d1ff6a_1ba4a_ff.html)** regarding inquiries about the inventorship of each claimed invention and regarding correction of inventorship when an application is amended such that one (or more) of the named joint inventors is no longer a joint inventor of the subject matter of any claim remaining in the application. See **[MPEP § 602.01(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e4830ss602.html)** _et seq._ for additional information pertaining to the correction of inventorship.

# 2111    Claim Interpretation; Broadest Reasonable Interpretation [R-10.2019]

##    **CLAIMS MUST BE GIVEN THEIR BROADEST REASONABLE INTERPRETATION IN LIGHT OF THE SPECIFICATION**

During patent examination, the pending claims must be "given their broadest reasonable interpretation consistent with the specification." The Federal Circuit’s _en banc_ decision in _Phillips v. AWH Corp.,_ 415 F.3d 1303, 1316, 75 USPQ2d 1321, 1329 (Fed. Cir. 2005) expressly recognized that the USPTO employs the "broadest reasonable interpretation" standard:

> The Patent and Trademark Office ("PTO") determines the scope of claims in patent applications not solely on the basis of the claim language, but upon giving claims their broadest reasonable construction "in light of the specification as it would be interpreted by one of ordinary skill in the art." _In re Am. Acad. of Sci. Tech. Ctr.,_ 367 F.3d 1359, 1364[, 70 USPQ2d 1827, 1830] (Fed. Cir. 2004). Indeed, the rules of the PTO require that application claims must "conform to the invention as set forth in the remainder of the specification and the terms and phrases used in the claims must find clear support or antecedent basis in the description so that the meaning of the terms in the claims may be ascertainable by reference to the description." **[37 CFR 1.75(d)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e320269.html)**.

See also _In re Suitco Surface, Inc.,_ 603 F.3d 1255, 1259, 94 USPQ2d 1640, 1643 (Fed. Cir. 2010); _In re Hyatt,_ 211 F.3d 1367, 1372, 54 USPQ2d 1664, 1667 (Fed. Cir. 2000).

Patented claims are not given the broadest reasonable interpretation during court proceedings involving infringement and validity, and can be interpreted based on a fully developed prosecution record. In contrast, an examiner must construe claim terms in the broadest reasonable manner during prosecution as is reasonably allowed in an effort to establish a clear record of what applicant intends to claim. Thus, the Office does not interpret claims when examining patent applications in the same manner as the courts. _In re Morris,_ 127 F.3d 1048, 1054, 44 USPQ2d 1023, 1028 (Fed. Cir. 1997); _In re Zletz,_ 893 F.2d 319, 321-22, 13 USPQ2d 1320, 1321-22 (Fed. Cir. 1989).

Because applicant has the opportunity to amend the claims during prosecution, giving a claim its broadest reasonable interpretation will reduce the possibility that the claim, once issued, will be interpreted more broadly than is justified. _In re Yamamoto,_ 740 F.2d 1569, 1571 (Fed. Cir. 1984); _In re Zletz,_ 893 F.2d 319, 321, 13 USPQ2d 1320, 1322 (Fed. Cir. 1989) ("During patent examination the pending claims must be interpreted as broadly as their terms reasonably allow."); _In re Prater,_ 415 F.2d 1393, 1404-05, 162 USPQ 541, 550-51 (CCPA 1969) (Claim 9 was directed to a process of analyzing data generated by mass spectrographic analysis of a gas. The process comprised selecting the data to be analyzed by subjecting the data to a mathematical manipulation. The examiner made rejections under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  and **[35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302383.html)**. In the **[35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302383.html)**  rejection, the examiner explained that the claim was anticipated by a mental process augmented by pencil and paper markings. The court agreed that the claim was not limited to using a machine to carry out the process since the claim did not explicitly set forth the machine. The court explained that "reading a claim in light of the specification, to thereby interpret limitations explicitly recited in the claim, is a quite different thing from ‘reading limitations of the specification into a claim,’ to thereby narrow the scope of the claim by implicitly adding disclosed limitations which have no express basis in the claim." The court found that applicant was advocating the latter, i.e., the impermissible importation of subject matter from the specification into the claim.). See also _In re Morris,_ 127 F.3d 1048, 1054-55, 44 USPQ2d 1023, 1027-28 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (The court held that the USPTO is not required, in the course of prosecution, to interpret claims in applications in the same manner as a court would interpret claims in an infringement suit. Rather, the "PTO applies to verbiage of the proposed claims the broadest reasonable meaning of the words in their ordinary usage as they would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art, taking into account whatever enlightenment by way of definitions or otherwise that may be afforded by the written description contained in applicant’s specification.").

The broadest reasonable interpretation does not mean the broadest possible interpretation. Rather, the meaning given to a claim term must be consistent with the ordinary and customary meaning of the term (unless the term has been given a special definition in the specification), and must be consistent with the use of the claim term in the specification and drawings. Further, the broadest reasonable interpretation of the claims must be consistent with the interpretation that those skilled in the art would reach. _In re Cortright,_ 165 F.3d 1353, 1359, 49 USPQ2d 1464, 1468 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (The Board’s construction of the claim limitation "restore hair growth" as requiring the hair to be returned to its original state was held to be an incorrect interpretation of the limitation. The court held that, consistent with applicant’s disclosure and the disclosure of three patents from analogous arts using the same phrase to require only some increase in hair growth, one of ordinary skill would construe "restore hair growth" to mean that the claimed method increases the amount of hair grown on the scalp, but does not necessarily produce a full head of hair.). Thus the focus of the inquiry regarding the meaning of a claim should be what would be reasonable from the perspective of one of ordinary skill in the art. _In re Suitco Surface, Inc.,_ 603 F.3d 1255, 1260, 94 USPQ2d 1640, 1644 (Fed. Cir. 2010); _In re Buszard,_ 504 F.3d 1364, 84 USPQ2d 1749 (Fed. Cir. 2007). In _Buszard,_ the claim was directed to a flame retardant composition comprising a flexible polyurethane foam reaction mixture. 504 F.3d at 1365, 84 USPQ2d at 1750. The Federal Circuit found that the Board’s interpretation that equated a "flexible" foam with a crushed "rigid" foam was not reasonable. _Id._ at 1367, 84 USPQ2d at 1751. Persuasive argument was presented that persons experienced in the field of polyurethane foams know that a flexible mixture is different than a rigid foam mixture. _Id._ at 1366, 84 USPQ2d at 1751.

## I.    **THE WORDS OF A CLAIM MUST BE GIVEN THEIR "PLAIN MEANING" UNLESS SUCH MEANING IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE SPECIFICATION**

Under a broadest reasonable interpretation (BRI), words of the claim must be given their plain meaning, unless such meaning is inconsistent with the specification. The plain meaning of a term means the ordinary and customary meaning given to the term by those of ordinary skill in the art at the relevant time. The ordinary and customary meaning of a term may be evidenced by a variety of sources, including the words of the claims themselves, the specification, drawings, and prior art. However, the best source for determining the meaning of a claim term is the specification - the greatest clarity is obtained when the specification serves as a glossary for the claim terms. _Phillips v. AWH Corp.,_ 415 F.3d 1303, 1315, 75 USPQ2d 1321, 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (_en banc_) ("[T]he specification ‘is always highly relevant to the claim construction analysis. Usually, it is dispositive; it is the single best guide to the meaning of a disputed term.’" (quoting _Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptronic Inc.,_ 90 F.3d 1576, 1582 (Fed. Cir. 1996)). The words of the claim must be given their plain meaning unless the plain meaning is inconsistent with the specification. _In re Zletz,_ 893 F.2d 319, 321, 13 USPQ2d 1320, 1322 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (discussed below); _Chef America, Inc. v. Lamb-Weston, Inc.,_ 358 F.3d 1371, 1372, 69 USPQ2d 1857 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (Ordinary, simple English words whose meaning is clear and unquestionable, absent any indication that their use in a particular context changes their meaning, are construed to mean exactly what they say. Thus, "heating the resulting batter-coated dough to a temperature in the range of about 400oF to 850oF" required heating the dough, rather than the air inside an oven, to the specified temperature.). See also _Salazar v. AT&T Mobility LLC,_ 64 F.4th 1311, 1317-1318, 2023 USPQ2d 412 (Fed. Cir. 2023) (While the claim language, "a microprocessor for generating . . . , said microprocessor creating . . . , a plurality of parameter sets retrieved by said microprocessor . . . , said microprocessor generating . . . ," does not require there be only one microprocessor, the limitations to "said microprocessor" require a singular element—"a microprocessor"—to be capable of performing all of the recited "generating," "creating," and "retrieving" functions. Similarly, "[f]or a dog owner to have ‘a dog that rolls over and fetches sticks,’ it does not suffice that he have two dogs, each able to perform just one of the tasks." (quoting _In re Varma,_ 816 F.3d 1352, 1363, 118 USPQ2d 1342, 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2016))).

The presumption that a term is given its ordinary and customary meaning may be rebutted by the applicant by clearly setting forth a different definition of the term in the specification. _In re Morris,_ 127 F.3d 1048, 1054, 44 USPQ2d 1023, 1028 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (the USPTO looks to the ordinary use of the claim terms taking into account definitions or other "enlightenment" contained in the written description); _But c.f. In re Am. Acad. of Sci. Tech. Ctr.,_ 367 F.3d 1359, 1369, 70 USPQ2d 1827, 1834 (Fed. Cir. 2004) ("We have cautioned against reading limitations into a claim from the preferred embodiment described in the specification, even if it is the only embodiment described, absent clear disclaimer in the specification."). When the specification sets a clear path to the claim language, the scope of the claims is more easily determined and the public notice function of the claims is best served.

## II.    **IT IS IMPROPER TO IMPORT CLAIM LIMITATIONS FROM THE SPECIFICATION**

"Though understanding the claim language may be aided by explanations contained in the written description, it is important not to import into a claim limitations that are not part of the claim. For example, a particular embodiment appearing in the written description may not be read into a claim when the claim language is broader than the embodiment." _Superguide Corp. v. DirecTV Enterprises, Inc.,_ 358 F.3d 870, 875, 69 USPQ2d 1865, 1868 (Fed. Cir. 2004). See also _Liebel-Flarsheim Co. v. Medrad Inc.,_ 358 F.3d 898, 906, 69 USPQ2d 1801, 1807 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (discussing recent cases wherein the court expressly rejected the contention that if a patent describes only a single embodiment, the claims of the patent must be construed as being limited to that embodiment); _E-Pass Techs., Inc. v. 3Com Corp.,_ 343 F.3d 1364, 1369, 67 USPQ2d 1947, 1950 (Fed. Cir. 2003) ("Interpretation of descriptive statements in a patent’s written description is a difficult task, as an inherent tension exists as to whether a statement is a clear lexicographic definition or a description of a preferred embodiment. The problem is to interpret claims ‘in view of the specification’ without unnecessarily importing limitations from the specification into the claims."); _Altiris Inc. v. Symantec Corp.,_ 318 F.3d 1363, 1371, 65 USPQ2d 1865, 1869-70 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (Although the specification discussed only a single embodiment, the court held that it was improper to read a specific order of steps into method claims where, as a matter of logic or grammar, the language of the method claims did not impose a specific order on the performance of the method steps, and the specification did not directly or implicitly require a particular order). See also subsection IV, below. When an element is claimed using language falling under the scope of **[35 U.S.C. 112(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824.html)**, 6th paragraph (often broadly referred to as means- (or step-) plus- function language), the specification must be consulted to determine the structure, material, or acts corresponding to the function recited in the claim, and the claimed element is construed as limited to the corresponding structure, material, or acts described in the specification and equivalents thereof. _In re Donaldson,_ 16 F.3d 1189, 29 USPQ2d 1845 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (see **[MPEP § 2181](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e219279.html)**- **[MPEP § 2186](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e220631.html)**).

In _Zletz,_ _supra,_ the examiner and the Board had interpreted claims reading "normally solid polypropylene" and "normally solid polypropylene having a crystalline polypropylene content" as being limited to "normally solid linear high homopolymers of propylene which have a crystalline polypropylene content." The court ruled that limitations, not present in the claims, were improperly imported from the specification. See also _In re Marosi,_ 710 F.2d 799, 802, 218 USPQ 289, 292 (Fed. Cir. 1983) ("'[C]laims are not to be read in a vacuum, and limitations therein are to be interpreted in light of the specification in giving them their ‘broadest reasonable interpretation.'" (quoting _In re Okuzawa,_ 537 F.2d 545, 548, 190 USPQ 464, 466 (CCPA 1976)). The court looked to the specification to construe "essentially free of alkali metal" as including unavoidable levels of impurities but no more.).

In _Sisvel Int’l S.A. v. Sierra Wireless, Inc.,_ 81 F.4th 1231, 1236-37, 2023 USPQ2d 1030 (Fed. Cir. 2023), the court found that construing "connection rejection message" should be given its plain and ordinary meaning, and should not be construed in such a way as to improperly limit the claims to specific disclosed embodiments. The intrinsic evidence provided no basis to limit the claims to the preferred embodiments and a person of ordinary skill in the art would broadly interpret the claim language consistent with the broad statements in the specification.

## III.    **"PLAIN MEANING" REFERS TO THE ORDINARY AND CUSTOMARY MEANING GIVEN TO THE TERM BY THOSE OF ORDINARY SKILL IN THE ART**

"[T]he ordinary and customary meaning of a claim term is the meaning that the term would have to a person of ordinary skill in the art in question at the time of the invention, _i.e_., as of the effective filing date of the patent application." _Phillips v. AWH Corp.,_415 F.3d 1303, 1313, 75 USPQ2d 1321, 1326 (Fed. Cir. 2005) _(en banc)_; _Sunrace Roots Enter. Co. v. SRAM Corp.,_ 336 F.3d 1298, 1302, 67 USPQ2d 1438, 1441 (Fed. Cir. 2003); _Brookhill-Wilk 1, LLC v. Intuitive Surgical, Inc.,_ 334 F.3d 1294, 1298, 67 USPQ2d 1132, 1136 (Fed. Cir. 2003) ("In the absence of an express intent to impart a novel meaning to the claim terms, the words are presumed to take on the ordinary and customary meanings attributed to them by those of ordinary skill in the art.").

The ordinary and customary meaning of a term may be evidenced by a variety of sources, including the words of the claims themselves, the specification, drawings, and prior art. However, the best source for determining the meaning of a claim term is the specification – the greatest clarity is obtained when the specification serves as a glossary for the claim terms. See, e.g., _In re Abbott Diabetes Care Inc.,_ 696 F.3d 1142, 1149-50, 104 USPQ2d 1337, 1342-43 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (construing the term "electrochemical sensor" as "devoid of external connection cables or wires to connect to a sensor control unit" to be consistent with "the language of the claims and the specification"); _In re Suitco Surface, Inc.,_ 603 F.3d 1255, 1260-61, 94 USPQ2d 1640, 1644 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (construing the term "material for finishing the top surface of the floor" to mean "a clear, uniform layer on the top surface of a floor that is the final treatment or coating of a surface" to be consistent with "the express language of the claim and the specification"); _Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptronic Inc.,_ 90 F.3d 1576, 1583, 39 USPQ2d 1573, 1577 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (construing the term "solder reflow temperature" to mean "peak reflow temperature" of solder rather than the "liquidus temperature" of solder in order to remain consistent with the specification); _Malvern Panalytical Inc. v. TA Instruments-Waters LLC,_ 85 F.4th 1365, 1374-75, 2023 USPQ2d 1297 (Fed. Cir. 2023) (the court construed "pipette guiding mechanism" as a mechanism that guides the pipette assembly either manually or automatically, and stated that the plain and ordinary meaning can be ascertained by examining the claim language, specification, and the prosecution history).

In some cases it is also appropriate to look to how the claim term is used in the prior art, which includes prior art patents, published applications, trade publications, and dictionaries. _Phillips v. AWH Corp.,_ 415 F.3d 1303, 1317, 75 USPQ2d 1321, 1329 (Fed. Cir. 2005) ("Although we have emphasized the importance of intrinsic evidence in claim construction, we have also authorized district courts to rely on extrinsic evidence, which "consists of all evidence external to the patent and prosecution history, including expert and inventor testimony, dictionaries, and learned treatises.")

Any meaning of a claim term taken from the prior art must be consistent with the use of the claim term in the specification and drawings. Moreover, when the specification is clear about the scope and content of a claim term, there is no need to turn to extrinsic evidence for claim interpretation. _3M Innovative Props. Co. v. Tredegar Corp.,_ 725 F.3d 1315, 1326-28, 107 USPQ2d 1717, 1726-27 (Fed. Cir. 2013) (holding that "continuous microtextured skin layer over substantially the entire laminate" was clearly defined in the written description, and therefore, there was no need to turn to extrinsic evidence to construe the claim). See also _Seabed Geosolutions (US) Inc. v. Magseis FF LLC,_ 8 F.4th 1285, 1290, 2021 USPQ2d 848 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (finding that where the intrinsic evidence (i.e., the claims, written description and prosecution history) clearly supports a claim interpretation, it is unnecessary to resort to extrinsic evidence.). However, in some instances where neither the claims, nor the specification, nor the prosecution history offer sufficient clarity on claim scope, extrinsic evidence may become a necessary part of claim interpretation. In _Actelion,_ the claim language of "a pH of 13 or higher" was unclear after analysis of the intrinsic evidence. The court looked to the specification, which inconsistently described the level of specificity for a pH of 13. Finally, the court turned to the prosecution history, which also did not provide any clarity as to whether a pH of 13 includes values that round to 13, such as 12.5. The court found that in this case extrinsic evidence should be consulted to understand "the meaning of a term in the relevant art during the relevant time period". _Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd v. Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc.,_ 85 F.4th 1167, 1172-74, 2023 USPQ2d 1314 (Fed. Cir. 2023) (quoting _Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc v. Sandoz, Inc.,_ 574 U.S. 318, 331, 135 S. Ct. 831, 841, 113 USPQ2d 1269, 1276 (2015)).

## IV.    **APPLICANT MAY BE OWN LEXICOGRAPHER AND/OR MAY DISAVOW CLAIM SCOPE**

The only exceptions to giving the words in a claim their ordinary and customary meaning in the art are (1) when the applicant acts as their own lexicographer; and (2) when the applicant disavows or disclaims the full scope of a claim term in the specification. To act as their own lexicographer, the applicant must clearly set forth a special definition of a claim term in the specification that differs from the plain and ordinary meaning it would otherwise possess. _CCS Fitness, Inc. v. Brunswick Corp.,_ 288 F.3d 1359, 1366, 62 USPQ2d 1658, 1662 (Fed. Cir. 2002). The specification may also include an intentional disclaimer, or disavowal, of claim scope. In both of these cases, "the inventor’s intention, as expressed in the specification, is regarded as dispositive." _Phillips v. AWH Corp.,_ 415 F.3d 1303, 1316 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (_en banc_). See also _Starhome GmbH v. AT&T Mobility LLC,_ 743 F.3d 849, 857, 109 USPQ2d 1885, 1890-91 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (holding that the term "gateway" should be given its ordinary and customary meaning of "a connection between different networks" because nothing in the specification indicated a clear intent to depart from that ordinary meaning); _Thorner v. Sony Computer Entm’t Am. LLC,_ 669 F.3d 1362, 1367-68, 101 USPQ2d 1457, 1460 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (The asserted claims of the patent were directed to a tactile feedback system for video game controllers comprising a flexible pad with a plurality of actuators "attached to said pad." The court held that the claims were not limited to actuators attached to the external surface of the pad, even though the specification used the word "attached" when describing embodiments affixed to the external surface of the pad but the word "embedded" when describing embodiments affixed to the internal surface of the pad. The court explained that the plain and ordinary meaning of "attached" includes both external and internal attachments. Further, there is no clear and explicit statement in the specification to redefine "attached" or disavow the full scope of the term.).

## A.    _**Lexicography**_

An applicant is entitled to be their own lexicographer and may rebut the presumption that claim terms are to be given their ordinary and customary meaning by clearly setting forth a definition of the term that is different from its ordinary and customary meaning(s) in the specification at the relevant time. See _In re Paulsen,_ 30 F.3d 1475, 1480, 31 USPQ2d 1671, 1674 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (holding that an inventor may define specific terms used to describe invention, but must do so "with reasonable clarity, deliberateness, and precision" and, if done, must "‘set out his uncommon definition in some manner within the patent disclosure’ so as to give one of ordinary skill in the art notice of the change" in meaning) (quoting _Intellicall, Inc. v. Phonometrics, Inc.,_ 952 F.2d 1384, 1387-88, 21 USPQ2d 1383, 1386 (Fed. Cir. 1992)).

Where an explicit definition is provided by the applicant for a term, that definition will control interpretation of the term as it is used in the claim. _Toro Co. v. White Consolidated Industries Inc.,_ 199 F.3d 1295, 1301, 53 USPQ2d 1065, 1069 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (meaning of words used in a claim is not construed in a "lexicographic vacuum, but in the context of the specification and drawings"). Thus, if a claim term is used in its ordinary and customary meaning throughout the specification, and the written description clearly indicates its meaning, then the term in the claim has that meaning. _Old Town Canoe Co. v. Confluence Holdings Corp.,_ 448 F.3d 1309, 1317, 78 USPQ2d 1705, 1711 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (The court held that "completion of coalescence" must be given its ordinary and customary meaning of reaching the end of coalescence. The court explained that even though coalescence could theoretically be "completed" by halting the molding process earlier, the specification clearly intended that completion of coalescence occurs only after the molding process reaches its optimum stage.).

However, it is important to note that any special meaning assigned to a term "must be sufficiently clear in the specification that any departure from common usage would be so understood by a person of experience in the field of the invention." _Multiform Desiccants Inc. v. Medzam Ltd.,_ 133 F.3d 1473, 1477, 45 USPQ2d 1429, 1432 (Fed. Cir. 1998). See also _Process Control Corp. v. HydReclaim Corp.,_ 190 F.3d 1350, 1357, 52 USPQ2d 1029, 1033 (Fed. Cir. 1999) and **[MPEP § 2173.05(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e217839.html)**. In _Apple Inc. v. Corephotonics, Ltd.,_ 81 F.4th 1353, 1358-60, 2023 USPQ2d 1056 (Fed. Cir. 2023), the claim phrase "a point of view of the Wide camera" was held to only require a "Wide perspective point of view or Wide position point of view" after reviewing the specification. In particular, the court found that a reasonable reading of the specification defined two different types of Wide point of view – perspective and position, whereas the claim language was broad as to the point of view. The court also explained that claims should not be interpreted in a way that would omit a disclosed embodiment, absent evidence to the contrary. Thus, given the review of the intrinsic evidence, the court held that the claim language only required Wide perspective or Wide position point of view, but not both.

In some cases, the meaning of a particular claim term may be defined by implication, that is, according to the usage of the term in the context in the specification. See _Phillips v. AWH Corp.,_ 415 F.3d 1303, 1320-21, 75 USPQ2d 1321, 1332 (Fed. Cir. 2005) _(en banc)_; _Vitronics Corp. v. Conceptronic Inc.,_ 90 F.3d 1576, 1583, 39 USPQ2d 1573, 1577 (Fed. Cir. 1996). But where the specification is ambiguous as to whether the inventor used claim terms inconsistent with their ordinary meaning, the ordinary meaning will apply. _Merck & Co. v. Teva Pharms. USA, Inc.,_ 395 F.3d 1364, 1370, 73 USPQ2d 1641, 1646 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (The Federal Circuit reversed the district court’s construction of the claim term "about" as "exactly." The appellate court explained that a passage in the specification the district court relied upon for the definition of "about" was too ambiguous to redefine "about" to mean "exactly" in clear enough terms. The appellate court held that "about" should instead be given its plain and ordinary meaning of "approximately.").

## B.    _**Disavowal**_

Applicant may also rebut the presumption of plain meaning by clearly disavowing the full scope of the claim term in the specification. Disavowal, or disclaimer of claim scope, is only considered when it is clear and unmistakable. See _SciMed Life Sys., Inc. v. Advanced Cardiovascular Sys., Inc.,_ 242 F.3d 1337, 1341, 58 USPQ2d 1059, 1063 (Fed. Cir. 2001) ("Where the specification makes clear that the invention does not include a particular feature, that feature is deemed to be outside the reach of the claims of the patent, even though the language of the claims, read without reference to the specification, might be considered broad enough to encompass the feature in question."); see also _In re Am. Acad. Of Sci. Tech Ctr.,_ 367 F.3d 1359, 1365-67, 70 USPQ2d 1827, 1831-33 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (refusing to limit claim term "user computer" to only "single-user computers" even though "some of the language of the specification, when viewed in isolation, might lead a reader to conclude that the term . . . is meant to refer to a computer that serves only a single user, the specification as a whole suggests a construction that is not so narrow"). But, in some cases, disavowal of a broader claim scope may be made by implication, such as where the specification contains only disparaging remarks with respect to a feature and every embodiment in the specification excludes that feature. _In re Abbott Diabetes Care Inc.,_ 696 F.3d 1142, 1149-50, 104 USPQ2d 1337, 1342-43 (Fed. Cir. 2012) (holding that the broadest reasonable interpretation of the claim term "electrochemical sensor" does not include a sensor having "external connection cables or wires" because the specification "repeatedly, consistently, and exclusively depict[s] an electrochemical sensor without external cables or wires while simultaneously disparaging sensors with external cables or wires"). But see _In re Clarke,_ 809 Fed. Appx. 787, 794, 2020 USPQ2d 10253 (Fed. Cir. 2020) ("The doctrine of prosecution history estoppel is _inapplicable_ during prosecution. Instead the doctrine is applicable only to _issued_ patents.") (emphasis in the original). If the examiner believes that the broadest reasonable interpretation of a claim is narrower than what the words of the claim otherwise suggest as the result of implicit disavowal in the specification, then the examiner should make the interpretation clear on the record.

## V.    **SUMMARY OF DETERMINING THE MEANING OF A CLAIM TERM THAT DOES NOT INVOKE 35 U.S.C. 112(f)**

This flow chart indicates the decisions an examiner would follow in order to ascertain the proper claim interpretation based on the plain meaning definition of BRI. With each decision in the flow chart, a different path may need to be taken to conclude whether plain meaning applies or a special definition applies.

The first question is to determine whether a claim term has an ordinary and customary meaning to those of ordinary skill in the art. If so, then the examiner should check the specification to determine whether it provides a special definition for the claim term. If the specification does not provide a special definition for the claim term, the examiner should apply the ordinary and customary meaning to the claim term. If the specification provides a special definition for the claim term, the examiner should use the special definition. However, because there is a presumption that claim terms have their ordinary and customary meaning and the specification must provide a clear and intentional use of a special definition for the claim term to be treated as having a special definition, an Office action should acknowledge and identify the special definition in this situation.

Moving back to the first question, if a claim term does not have an ordinary and customary meaning, the examiner should check the specification to determine whether it provides a meaning to the claim term. If no reasonably clear meaning can be ascribed to the claim term after considering the specification and prior art, the examiner should apply the broadest reasonable interpretation to the claim term as it can be best understood. Also, the claim should be rejected under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)**  and the specification objected to under **[37 CFR 1.75(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e320269.html##d0e320295)**.

If the specification provides a meaning for the claim term, the examiner should use the meaning provided by the specification. It may be appropriate for an Office action to acknowledge and identify the meaning provided by the specification in this situation.

# 2111.02    Effect of Preamble [R-07.2022]

The determination of whether a preamble limits a claim is made on a case-by-case basis in light of the facts in each case; there is no litmus test defining when a preamble limits the scope of a claim. _Catalina Mktg. Int’l v. Coolsavings.com, Inc.,_ 289 F.3d 801, 808, 62 USPQ2d 1781, 1785 (Fed. Cir. 2002). See _id._ at 808-10, 62 USPQ2d at 1784-86 for a discussion of guideposts that have emerged from various decisions exploring the preamble’s effect on claim scope, as well as a hypothetical example illustrating these principles.

"[A] claim preamble has the import that the claim as a whole suggests for it." _Bell Communications Research, Inc. v. Vitalink Communications Corp.,_ 55 F.3d 615, 620, 34 USPQ2d 1816, 1820 (Fed. Cir. 1995). "If the claim preamble, when read in the context of the entire claim, recites limitations of the claim, or, if the claim preamble is ‘necessary to give life, meaning, and vitality’ to the claim, then the claim preamble should be construed as if in the balance of the claim." _Pitney Bowes, Inc. v. Hewlett-Packard Co.,_ 182 F.3d 1298, 1305, 51 USPQ2d 1161, 1165-66 (Fed. Cir. 1999). See also _Jansen v. Rexall Sundown, Inc.,_ 342 F.3d 1329, 1333, 68 USPQ2d 1154, 1158 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (In considering the effect of the preamble in a claim directed to a method of treating or preventing pernicious anemia in humans by administering a certain vitamin preparation to "a human in need thereof," the court held that the claims’ recitation of a patient or a human "in need" gives life and meaning to the preamble’s statement of purpose.). _Kropa v. Robie,_ 187 F.2d 150, 152, 88 USPQ 478, 481 (CCPA 1951) (A preamble reciting "[a]n abrasive article" was deemed essential to point out the invention defined by claims to an article comprising abrasive grains and a hardened binder and the process of making it. The court stated "it is only by that phrase that it can be known that the subject matter defined by the claims is comprised as an abrasive article. Every union of substances capable _inter alia_ of use as abrasive grains and a binder is not an ‘abrasive article.’" Therefore, the preamble served to further define the structure of the article produced.).

## I.    **PREAMBLE STATEMENTS LIMITING STRUCTURE**

Any terminology in the preamble that limits the structure of the claimed invention must be treated as a claim limitation. See, e.g., _Corning Glass Works v. Sumitomo Elec. U.S.A., Inc.,_ 868 F.2d 1251, 1257, 9 USPQ2d 1962, 1966 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (The determination of whether preamble recitations are structural limitations can be resolved only on review of the entirety of the application "to gain an understanding of what the inventors actually invented and intended to encompass by the claim" as drafted without importing "‘extraneous’ limitations from the specification."); _Pac-Tec Inc. v. Amerace Corp.,_ 903 F.2d 796, 801, 14 USPQ2d 1871, 1876 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (determining that preamble language that constitutes a structural limitation is actually part of the claimed invention). See also _In re Stencel,_ 828 F.2d 751, 4 USPQ2d 1071 (Fed. Cir. 1987) (The claim at issue was directed to a driver for setting a joint of a threaded collar; however, the body of the claim did not directly include the structure of the collar as part of the claimed article. The examiner did not consider the preamble, which did set forth the structure of the collar, as limiting the claim. The court found that the collar structure could not be ignored. While the claim was not directly limited to the collar, the collar structure recited in the preamble did limit the structure of the driver. "[T]he framework - the teachings of the prior art - against which patentability is measured is not all drivers broadly, but drivers suitable for use in combination with this collar, for the claims are so limited." _Id._ at 1073, 828 F.2d at 754.).

## II.    **PREAMBLE STATEMENTS RECITING PURPOSE OR INTENDED USE**

The claim preamble must be read in the context of the entire claim. The determination of whether preamble recitations are structural limitations or mere statements of purpose or use "can be resolved only on review of the entirety of the [record] to gain an understanding of what the inventors actually invented and intended to encompass by the claim" as drafted without importing "‘extraneous’ limitations from the specification." _Corning Glass Works,_ 868 F.2d at 1257, 9 USPQ2d at 1966. If the body of a claim fully and intrinsically sets forth all of the limitations of the claimed invention, and the preamble merely states, for example, the purpose or intended use of the invention, rather than any distinct definition of any of the claimed invention’s limitations, then the preamble is not considered a limitation and is of no significance to claim construction. _Shoes by Firebug LLC v. Stride Rite Children’s Grp., LLC,_ 962 F.3d 1362, 2020 USPQ2d 10701 (Fed. Cir. 2020) (The court found that the preamble in one patent’s claim is limiting but is not in a related patent); _Pitney Bowes, Inc. v. Hewlett-Packard Co.,_ 182 F.3d 1298, 1305, 51 USPQ2d 1161, 1165 (Fed. Cir. 1999). See also _Rowe v. Dror,_ 112 F.3d 473, 478, 42 USPQ2d 1550, 1553 (Fed. Cir. 1997) ("where a patentee defines a structurally complete invention in the claim body and uses the preamble only to state a purpose or intended use for the invention, the preamble is not a claim limitation"); _Kropa v. Robie,_ 187 F.2d at 152, 88 USPQ2d at 480-81 (preamble is not a limitation where claim is directed to a product and the preamble merely recites a property inherent in an old product defined by the remainder of the claim); _STX LLC. v. Brine,_ 211 F.3d 588, 591, 54 USPQ2d 1347, 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (holding that the preamble phrase "which provides improved playing and handling characteristics" in a claim drawn to a head for a lacrosse stick was not a claim limitation). Compare _Jansen v. Rexall Sundown, Inc.,_ 342 F.3d 1329, 1333-34, 68 USPQ2d 1154, 1158 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (In a claim directed to a method of treating or preventing pernicious anemia in humans by administering a certain vitamin preparation to "a human in need thereof," the court held that the preamble is not merely a statement of effect that may or may not be desired or appreciated, but rather is a statement of the intentional purpose for which the method must be performed. Thus the claim is properly interpreted to mean that the vitamin preparation must be administered to a human with a recognized need to treat or prevent pernicious anemia.); _Nantkwest , Inc. v. Lee,_ 686 Fed. App'x 864, 867 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (nonprecedential) (The court found that the preamble phrase "treating a cancer" "’require[s] lysis of many cells, in order to accomplish the goal of treating cancer’ and not merely lysing one or a few cancer cells."); _In re Cruciferous Sprout Litig.,_ 301 F.3d 1343, 1346-48, 64 USPQ2d 1202, 1204-05 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (A claim at issue was directed to a method of preparing a food rich in glucosinolates wherein cruciferous sprouts are harvested prior to the 2-leaf stage. The court held that the preamble phrase "rich in glucosinolates" helps define the claimed invention, as evidenced by the specification and prosecution history, and thus is a limitation of the claim (although the claim was anticipated by prior art that produced sprouts inherently "rich in glucosinolates")).

During examination, statements in the preamble reciting the purpose or intended use of the claimed invention must be evaluated to determine whether or not the recited purpose or intended use results in a structural difference (or, in the case of process claims, manipulative difference) between the claimed invention and the prior art. If so, the recitation serves to limit the claim. See, e.g., _In re Otto,_ 312 F.2d 937, 938, 136 USPQ 458, 459 (CCPA 1963) (The claims were directed to a core member for hair curlers and a process of making a core member for hair curlers. The court held that the intended use of hair curling was of no significance to the structure and process of making.); _In re Sinex,_ 309 F.2d 488, 492, 135 USPQ 302, 305 (CCPA 1962) (statement of intended use in an apparatus claim did not distinguish over the prior art apparatus). To satisfy an intended use limitation which is limiting, a prior art structure which is capable of performing the intended use as recited in the preamble meets the claim. See, e.g., _In re Schreiber,_ 128 F.3d 1473, 1477, 44 USPQ2d 1429, 1431 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (anticipation rejection affirmed based on Board’s factual finding that the reference dispenser (a spout disclosed as useful for purposes such as dispensing oil from an oil can) would be capable of dispensing popcorn in the manner set forth in appellant’s claim 1 (a dispensing top for dispensing popcorn in a specified manner)) and cases cited therein. See also **[MPEP § 2112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e201036.html)** - **[MPEP § 2112.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e201360.html)**.

However, a "preamble may provide context for claim construction, particularly, where … that preamble’s statement of intended use forms the basis for distinguishing the prior art in the patent’s prosecution history." _Metabolite Labs., Inc. v. Corp. of Am. Holdings,_ 370 F.3d 1354, 1358-62, 71 USPQ2d 1081, 1084-87 (Fed. Cir. 2004). The patent claim at issue was directed to a two-step method for detecting a deficiency of vitamin B12 or folic acid, involving (i) assaying a body fluid for an "elevated level" of homocysteine, and (ii) "correlating" an "elevated" level with a vitamin deficiency. _Id._ at 1358-59, 71 USPQ2d at 1084. The court stated that the disputed claim term "correlating" can include comparing with either an unelevated level or elevated level, as opposed to only an elevated level because adding the "correlating" step in the claim during prosecution to overcome prior art tied the preamble directly to the "correlating" step. _Id._ at 1362, 71 USPQ2d at 1087. The recitation of the intended use of "detecting" a vitamin deficiency in the preamble rendered the claimed invention a method for "detecting," and, thus, was not limited to detecting "elevated" levels. _Id._

See also _Catalina Mktg. Int’l,_ 289 F.3d at 808-09, 62 USPQ2d at 1785 ("[C]lear reliance on the preamble during prosecution to distinguish the claimed invention from the prior art transforms the preamble into a claim limitation because such reliance indicates use of the preamble to define, in part, the claimed invention.…Without such reliance, however, a preamble generally is not limiting when the claim body describes a structurally complete invention such that deletion of the preamble phrase does not affect the structure or steps of the claimed invention." Consequently, "preamble language merely extolling benefits or features of the claimed invention does not limit the claim scope without clear reliance on those benefits or features as patentably significant."). In _Poly-America LP v. GSE Lining Tech. Inc.,_ 383 F.3d 1303, 1310, 72 USPQ2d 1685, 1689 (Fed. Cir. 2004), the court stated that "a ‘[r]eview of the entirety of the ’047 patent reveals that the preamble language relating to ‘blown-film’ does not state a purpose or an intended use of the invention, but rather discloses a fundamental characteristic of the claimed invention that is properly construed as a limitation of the claim.’" Compare _Intirtool, Ltd. v. Texar Corp.,_ 369 F.3d 1289, 1294-96, 70 USPQ2d 1780, 1783-84 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (holding that the preamble of a patent claim directed to a "hand-held punch pliers for simultaneously punching and connecting overlapping sheet metal" was not a limitation of the claim because (i) the body of the claim described a "structurally complete invention" without the preamble, and (ii) statements in prosecution history referring to "punching and connecting" function of invention did not constitute "clear reliance" on the preamble needed to make the preamble a limitation).

# 2111.03    Transitional Phrases [R-01.2024]

The transitional phrases "comprising", "consisting essentially of" and "consisting of" define the scope of a claim with respect to what unrecited additional components or steps, if any, are excluded from the scope of the claim. The determination of what is or is not excluded by a transitional phrase must be made on a case-by-case basis in light of the facts of each case.

## I.    **COMPRISING**

The transitional term "comprising", which is synonymous with "including," "containing," or "characterized by," is inclusive or open-ended and does not exclude additional, unrecited elements or method steps. See, e.g., _Mars Inc. v. H.J. Heinz Co.,_ 377 F.3d 1369, 1376, 71 USPQ2d 1837, 1843 (Fed. Cir. 2004) ("[L]ike the term ‘comprising,’ the terms ‘containing’ and ‘mixture’ are open-ended."). _Invitrogen Corp. v. Biocrest Manufacturing, L.P.,_ 327 F.3d 1364, 1368, 66 USPQ2d 1631, 1634 (Fed. Cir. 2003) ("The transition ‘comprising’ in a method claim indicates that the claim is open-ended and allows for additional steps."); _Genentech, Inc. v. Chiron Corp.,_ 112 F.3d 495, 501, 42 USPQ2d 1608, 1613 (Fed. Cir. 1997) ("Comprising" is a term of art used in claim language which means that the named elements are essential, but other elements may be added and still form a construct within the scope of the claim.); _Moleculon Research Corp._ _v._ _CBS, Inc.,_ 793 F.2d 1261, 229 USPQ 805 (Fed. Cir. 1986); _In re Baxter,_ 656 F.2d 679, 686, 210 USPQ 795, 803 (CCPA 1981); _Ex parte Davis,_ 80 USPQ 448, 450 (Bd. App. 1948) ("comprising" leaves "the claim open for the inclusion of unspecified ingredients even in major amounts"). In _Gillette Co. v. Energizer Holdings Inc.,_ 405 F.3d 1367, 1371-73, 74 USPQ2d 1586, 1589-91 (Fed. Cir. 2005), the court held that a claim to "a safety razor blade unit comprising a guard, a cap, and a group of first, second, and third blades" encompasses razors with more than three blades because the transitional phrase "comprising" in the preamble and the phrase "group of" are presumptively open-ended. "The word ‘comprising’ transitioning from the preamble to the body signals that the entire claim is presumptively open-ended." _Id._ In contrast, the court noted the phrase "group consisting of" is a closed term, which is often used in claim drafting to signal a "Markush group" that is by its nature closed. _Id._ The court also emphasized that reference to "first," "second," and "third" blades in the claim was not used to show a serial or numerical limitation but instead was used to distinguish or identify the various members of the group. _Id._

In _Amgen Inc. v. Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC,_ 945 F.3d 1368, 1379, 2020 USPQ2d 3197 (Fed. Cir. 2020), in an infringement suit, the court interpreted a claim for a pharmaceutical composition having a "comprising" transition phrase and following limitations, including limitations requiring "at least one" binder and "at least one" disintegrant, each "consisting of" items listed in a Markush group. The court found that the Markush grouping recited particular binders or disintegrants, but while the components of the Markush grouping are closed as to the components therein, the claim transition "comprising" allowed for additional component(s) that were functionally similar to the members of the Markush grouping. Thus, the plain language of the claim requires "at least one" of the Markush members and does not further limit the claim to only binders and disintegrants listed in the Markush grouping. See also **[MPEP § 2117](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d299b6_1ae8e_380.html)** for further discussion of a Markush group.

## II.    **CONSISTING OF**

The transitional phrase "consisting of" excludes any element, step, or ingredient not specified in the claim. _In re Gray,_ 53 F.2d 520, 11 USPQ 255 (CCPA 1931); _Ex parte Davis,_ 80 USPQ 448, 450 (Bd. App. 1948) ("consisting of" defined as "closing the claim to the inclusion of materials other than those recited except for impurities ordinarily associated therewith"). But see _Norian Corp. v. Stryker Corp.,_ 363 F.3d 1321, 1331-32, 70 USPQ2d 1508, 1516 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (holding that a bone repair kit "consisting of" claimed chemicals was infringed by a bone repair kit including a spatula in addition to the claimed chemicals because the presence of the spatula was unrelated to the claimed invention). A claim which depends from a claim which "consists of" the recited elements or steps cannot add an element or step.

A claim element defined by selection from a group of alternatives (a Markush grouping; see **[MPEP §§ 2117](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d299b6_1ae8e_380.html)** and **[2173.05(h)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e218467.html)**) requires selection from a closed group "consisting of" (rather than "comprising" or "including") the alternative members. _Abbott Labs. v. Baxter Pharmaceutical Products Inc.,_ 334 F.3d 1274, 1280, 67 USPQ2d 1191, 1196-97 (Fed. Cir. 2003). If the claim element is intended to encompass combinations or mixtures of the alternatives set forth in the Markush grouping, the claim may include qualifying language preceding the recited alternatives (such as "at least one member" selected from the group), or within the list of alternatives (such as "or mixtures thereof"). _Id._ In the absence of such qualifying language there is a presumption that the Markush group is closed to combinations or mixtures. Cf. _Multilayer Stretch Cling Film Holdings, Inc. v. Berry Plastics Corp.,_ 831 F.3d 1350, 1363-64, 119 USPQ2d 1773, 1784-85 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (presumption that Markush grouping does not encompass mixtures of listed resins overcome by intrinsic evidence in a dependent claim and the specification). See also _Amgen Inc. v. Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC,_ 945 F.3d 1368, 1378-79, 2020 USPQ2d 3179 (Fed. Cir. 2020) (the claim’s "comprising" transition phrase does not foreclose additional binders and disintegrants when an accused infringing product contains and meets the limitation’s requirements for one of the binders or disintegrants recited in the Markush groupings – there is no inconsistency with another binder or disintegrant outside of the Markush group also being part of the claimed formulation).

When the phrase "consisting of" appears in a clause of the body of a claim, rather than immediately following the preamble, there is an "exceptionally strong presumption that a claim term set off with ‘consisting of’ is closed to unrecited elements." _Multilayer Stretch Cling Film Holdings, Inc. v. Berry Plastics Corp.,_ 831 F.3d 1350, 1359, 119 USPQ2d 1773, 1781 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (a layer "selected from the group consisting of" specific resins is closed to resins other than those listed). However, the "consisting of" phrase limits only the element set forth in that clause; other elements are not excluded from the claim as a whole. _Mannesmann Demag Corp._ _v._ _Engineered Metal Products Co.,_ 793 F.2d 1279, 230 USPQ 45 (Fed. Cir. 1986). See also _In re Crish,_ 393 F.3d 1253, 73 USPQ2d 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (The claims at issue "related to purified DNA molecules having promoter activity for the human involucrin gene (hINV)." _Id.,_ 73 USPQ2d at 1365. In determining the scope of applicant’s claims directed to "a purified oligonucleotide comprising at least a portion of the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1 wherein said portion consists of the nucleotide sequence from … to 2473 of SEQ ID NO:1, and wherein said portion of the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1 has promoter activity," the court stated that the use of "consists" in the body of the claims did not limit the open-ended "comprising" language in the claims (emphases added). _Id._ at 1257, 73 USPQ2d at 1367. The court held that the claimed promoter sequence designated as SEQ ID NO:1 was obtained by sequencing the same prior art plasmid and was therefore anticipated by the prior art plasmid which necessarily possessed the same DNA sequence as the claimed oligonucleotides. _Id._ at 1256 and 1259, 73 USPQ2d at 1366 and 1369. The court affirmed the Board’s interpretation that the transition phrase "consists" did not limit the claims to only the recited numbered nucleotide sequences of SEQ ID NO:1 and that "the transition language ‘comprising’ allowed the claims to cover the entire involucrin gene plus other portions of the plasmid, as long as the gene contained the specific portions of SEQ ID NO:1 recited by the claim[s]." _Id._ at 1256, 73 USPQ2d at 1366.).

## III.    **CONSISTING ESSENTIALLY OF**

The transitional phrase "consisting essentially of" limits the scope of a claim to the specified materials or steps "and those that do not materially affect the basic and novel characteristic(s)" of the claimed invention. _In re Herz,_ 537 F.2d 549, 551-52, 190 USPQ 461, 463 (CCPA 1976) (emphasis in original) (Prior art hydraulic fluid required a dispersant which appellants argued was excluded from claims limited to a functional fluid "consisting essentially of" certain components. In finding the claims did not exclude the prior art dispersant, the court noted that appellants’ specification indicated the claimed composition can contain any well-known additive such as a dispersant, and there was no evidence that the presence of a dispersant would materially affect the basic and novel characteristic of the claimed invention. The prior art composition had the same basic and novel characteristic (increased oxidation resistance) as well as additional enhanced detergent and dispersant characteristics.). "A ‘consisting essentially of’ claim occupies a middle ground between closed claims that are written in a ‘consisting of’ format and fully open claims that are drafted in a ‘comprising’ format." _PPG Industries v. Guardian Industries,_ 156 F.3d 1351, 1354, 48 USPQ2d 1351, 1353-54 (Fed. Cir. 1998). See also _Atlas Powder v. E.I. duPont de Nemours & Co.,_ 750 F.2d 1569, 224 USPQ 409 (Fed. Cir. 1984); _In re Janakirama-Rao,_ 317 F.2d 951, 137 USPQ 893 (CCPA 1963); _Water Technologies Corp. vs. Calco, Ltd.,_ 850 F.2d 660, 7 USPQ2d 1097 (Fed. Cir. 1988). For the purposes of searching for and applying prior art under **[35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302383.html)**  and **[103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302450.html)**, absent a clear indication in the specification or claims of what the basic and novel characteristics actually are, "consisting essentially of" will be construed as equivalent to "comprising." See, e.g., _PPG,_ 156 F.3d at 1355, 48 USPQ2d at 1355 ("PPG could have defined the scope of the phrase ‘consisting essentially of’ for purposes of its patent by making clear in its specification what it regarded as constituting a material change in the basic and novel characteristics of the invention."). See also _AK Steel Corp. v. Sollac,_ 344 F.3d 1234, 1240-41, 68 USPQ2d 1280, 1283-84 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (Applicant’s statement in the specification that "silicon contents in the coating metal should not exceed about 0.5% by weight" along with a discussion of the deleterious effects of silicon provided basis to conclude that silicon in excess of 0.5% by weight would materially alter the basic and novel properties of the invention. Thus, "consisting essentially of" as recited in the preamble was interpreted to permit no more than 0.5% by weight of silicon in the aluminum coating.); _In re Janakirama-Rao,_ 317 F.2d 951, 954, 137 USPQ 893, 895-96 (CCPA 1963). If an applicant contends that additional steps or materials in the prior art are excluded by the recitation of "consisting essentially of," applicant has the burden of showing that the introduction of additional steps or components would materially change the characteristics of the claimed invention. _In re De Lajarte,_ 337 F.2d 870, 143 USPQ 256 (CCPA 1964). See also _Ex parte Hoffman,_ 12 USPQ2d 1061, 1063-64 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1989) ("Although ‘consisting essentially of’ is typically used and defined in the context of compositions of matter, we find nothing intrinsically wrong with the use of such language as a modifier of method steps. . . [rendering] the claim open only for the inclusion of steps which do not materially affect the basic and novel characteristics of the claimed method. To determine the steps included versus excluded the claim must be read in light of the specification. . . . [I]t is an applicant’s burden to establish that a step practiced in a prior art method is excluded from his claims by ‘consisting essentially of’ language.").

## IV.    **OTHER TRANSITIONAL PHRASES**

Transitional phrases such as "having" must be interpreted in light of the specification to determine whether open or closed claim language is intended. See, e.g., _Lampi Corp. v. American Power Products Inc.,_ 228 F.3d 1365, 1376, 56 USPQ2d 1445, 1453 (Fed. Cir. 2000) (interpreting the term "having" as open terminology, allowing the inclusion of other components in addition to those recited); _Crystal Semiconductor Corp. v. TriTech Microelectronics Int’l Inc.,_ 246 F.3d 1336, 1348, 57 USPQ2d 1953, 1959 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (term "having" in transitional phrase "does not create a presumption that the body of the claim is open"); _Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Eli Lilly & Co.,_ 119 F.3d 1559, 1573, 43 USPQ2d 1398, 1410 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (in the context of a cDNA having a sequence coding for human PI, the term "having" still permitted inclusion of other moieties). The transitional phrase "composed of" has been interpreted in the same manner as either "consisting of" or "consisting essentially of," depending on the facts of the particular case. See _AFG Industries, Inc. v. Cardinal IG Company,_ 239 F.3d 1239, 1245, 57 USPQ2d 1776, 1780-81 (Fed. Cir. 2001) (based on specification and other evidence, "composed of" interpreted in same manner as "consisting essentially of"); _In re Bertsch,_ 132 F.2d 1014, 1019-20, 56 USPQ 379, 384 (CCPA 1942) ("Composed of" interpreted in same manner as "consisting of"; however, the court further remarked that "the words ‘composed of’ may under certain circumstances be given, in patent law, a broader meaning than ‘consisting of.’").

# 2111.04    "Adapted to," "Adapted for," "Wherein," "Whereby," and Contingent Clauses [R-10.2019]

## I.    **"ADAPTED TO," "ADAPTED FOR," "WHEREIN," and "WHEREBY"**

Claim scope is not limited by claim language that suggests or makes optional but does not require steps to be performed, or by claim language that does not limit a claim to a particular structure. However, examples of claim language, although not exhaustive, that may raise a question as to the limiting effect of the language in a claim are:

- (A) "adapted to" or "adapted for" clauses;
- (B) "wherein" clauses; and
- (C) "whereby" clauses.

The determination of whether each of these clauses is a limitation in a claim depends on the specific facts of the case. See, e.g., _Griffin v. Bertina,_ 285 F.3d 1029, 1034, 62 USPQ2d 1431 (Fed. Cir. 2002) (finding that a "wherein" clause limited a process claim where the clause gave "meaning and purpose to the manipulative steps"). In _In re Giannelli,_ 739 F.3d 1375, 1378, 109 USPQ2d 1333, 1336 (Fed. Cir. 2014), the court found that an "adapted to" clause limited a machine claim where "the written description makes clear that 'adapted to,' as used in the [patent] application, has a narrower meaning, viz., that the claimed machine is designed or constructed to be used as a rowing machine whereby a pulling force is exerted on the handles." In _Hoffer v. Microsoft Corp.,_ 405 F.3d 1326, 1329, 74 USPQ2d 1481, 1483 (Fed. Cir. 2005), the court held that when a "‘whereby’ clause states a condition that is material to patentability, it cannot be ignored in order to change the substance of the invention." _Id._ However, the court noted that a "‘whereby clause in a method claim is not given weight when it simply expresses the intended result of a process step positively recited.’" _Id._ (quoting _Minton v. Nat’l Ass’n of Securities Dealers, Inc.,_ 336 F.3d 1373, 1381, 67 USPQ2d 1614, 1620 (Fed. Cir. 2003)).

## II.    **CONTINGENT LIMITATIONS**

The broadest reasonable interpretation of a method (or process) claim having contingent limitations requires only those steps that must be performed and does not include steps that are not required to be performed because the condition(s) precedent are not met. For example, assume a method claim requires step A if a first condition happens and step B if a second condition happens. If the claimed invention may be practiced without either the first or second condition happening, then neither step A or B is required by the broadest reasonable interpretation of the claim. If the claimed invention requires the first condition to occur, then the broadest reasonable interpretation of the claim requires step A. If the claimed invention requires both the first and second conditions to occur, then the broadest reasonable interpretation of the claim requires both steps A and B.

The broadest reasonable interpretation of a system (or apparatus or product) claim having structure that performs a function, which only needs to occur if a condition precedent is met, requires structure for performing the function should the condition occur. The system claim interpretation differs from a method claim interpretation because the claimed structure must be present in the system regardless of whether the condition is met and the function is actually performed.

See _Ex parte Schulhauser,_ Appeal 2013-007847 (PTAB April 28, 2016) for an analysis of contingent claim limitations in the context of both method claims and system claims. In _Schulhauser,_ both method claims and system claims recited the same contingent step. When analyzing the claimed method as a whole, the PTAB determined that giving the claim its broadest reasonable interpretation, "[i]f the condition for performing a contingent step is not satisfied, the performance recited by the step need not be carried out in order for the claimed method to be performed" (quotation omitted). _Schulhauser_ at 10. When analyzing the claimed system as a whole, the PTAB determined that "[t]he broadest reasonable interpretation of a system claim having structure that performs a function, which only needs to occur if a condition precedent is met, still requires structure for performing the function should the condition occur." _Schulhauser_ at 14. Therefore "[t]he Examiner did not need to present evidence of the obviousness of the [ ] method steps of claim 1 that are not required to be performed under a broadest reasonable interpretation of the claim (e.g., instances in which the electrocardiac signal data is not within the threshold electrocardiac criteria such that the condition precedent for the determining step and the remaining steps of claim 1 has not been met);" however to render the claimed system obvious, the prior art must teach the structure that performs the function of the contingent step along with the other recited claim limitations. _Schulhauser_ at 9, 14.

See also **[MPEP § 2143.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e210501.html)**.

# 2111.05    Functional and Nonfunctional Descriptive Material [R-07.2022]

USPTO personnel must consider all claim limitations when determining patentability of an invention over the prior art. _In re Gulack,_ 703 F.2d 1381, 1385, 217 USPQ 401, 403-04 (Fed. Cir. 1983). Since a claim must be read as a whole, USPTO personnel may not disregard claim limitations that include printed matter. See _Id._ at 1384, 217 USPQ at 403; see also _Diamond v. Diehr,_ 450 U.S. 175, 191, 209 USPQ 1, 10 (1981). The first step of the printed matter analysis is the determination that the limitation in question is in fact directed toward printed matter. "Our past cases establish a necessary condition for falling into the category of printed matter: a limitation is printed matter only if it claims the content of information." See _In re DiStefano,_ 808 F.3d 845, 848, 117 USPQ2d 1265, 1267 (Fed. Cir. 2015). "[O]nce it is determined that the limitation is directed to printed matter, [the examiner] must then determine if the matter is functionally or structurally related to the associated physical substrate, and only if the answer is ‘no’ is the printed matter owed no patentable weight." _Id._ at 850, 117 USPQ2d at 1268. If a new and nonobvious functional relationship between the printed matter and the substrate does exist, the examiner should give patentable weight to printed matter. See _In re Lowry,_ 32 F.3d 1579, 1583-84, 32 USPQ2d 1031, 1035 (Fed. Cir. 1994); _In re Ngai,_ 367 F.3d 1336, 70 USPQ2d 1862 (Fed. Cir. 2004); _In re Gulack,_ 703 F.2d 1381, 1385, 217 USPQ 401, 403-04 (Fed. Cir. 1983). The rationale behind the printed matter cases, in which, for example, written instructions are added to a known product, has been extended to method claims in which an instructional limitation is added to a method known in the art. Similar to the inquiry for products with printed matter thereon, in such method cases the relevant inquiry is whether a new and nonobvious functional relationship with the known method exists. See _In re DiStefano,_ 808 F.3d 845, 117 USPQ2d 1265 (Fed. Cir. 2015); _In re Kao,_ 639 F.3d 1057, 1072-73, 98 USPQ2d 1799, 1811-12 (Fed. Cir. 2011); _King Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Eon Labs Inc.,_ 616 F.3d 1267, 1279, 95 USPQ2d 1833, 1842 (Fed. Cir. 2010).

## I.    **DETERMINING WHETHER A FUNCTIONAL RELATIONSHIP EXISTS BETWEEN PRINTED MATTER AND ASSOCIATED SUBSTRATE**

## A.    **_Evidence Supporting a Functional Relationship_**

To be given patentable weight, the printed matter and associated product must be in a functional relationship. A functional relationship can be found where the printed matter performs some function with respect to the product to which it is associated. See _Lowry,_ 32 F.3d at 1584, 32 USPQ2d at 1035 (citing _Gulack,_ 703 F.2d at 1386, 217 USPQ at 404). For instance, indicia on a measuring cup perform the function of indicating volume within that measuring cup. See _In re Miller,_ 418 F.2d 1392, 1396, 164 USPQ 46, 49 (CCPA 1969). A functional relationship can also be found where the product performs some function with respect to the printed matter to which it is associated. For instance, where a hatband places a string of numbers in a certain physical relationship to each other such that a claimed algorithm is satisfied due to the physical structure of the hatband, the hatband performs a function with respect to the string of numbers. See _Gulack,_ 703 F.2d at 1386-87, 217 USPQ at 405.

## B.    **_Evidence Against a Functional Relationship_**

Where a product merely serves as a support for printed matter, no functional relationship exists. These situations may arise where the claim as a whole is directed towards conveying a message or meaning to a human reader independent of the supporting product. For example, a hatband with images displayed on the hatband but not arranged in any particular sequence was found to only serve as support and display for the printed matter. See _Gulack,_ 703 F.2d at 1386, 217 USPQ at 404. Another example in which a product merely serves as a support would occur for a deck of playing cards having images on each card. See _In re Bryan,_ 323 Fed. App'x 898 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (unpublished). In _Bryan_ the applicant asserted that the printed matter allowed the cards to be "collected, traded, and drawn"; "identify and distinguish one deck of cards from another"; and "enable[] the card to be traded and blind drawn". However, the court found that these functions do not pertain to the structure of the apparatus and were instead drawn to the method or process of playing a game. See also _Ex parte Gwinn,_ 112 USPQ 439, 446-47 (Bd. Pat. App. & Int. 1955), in which the invention was directed to a set of dice by means of which a game may be played. The claims differed from the prior art solely by the printed matter in the dice. The claims were properly rejected on prior art because there was no new feature of physical structure and no new relation of printed matter to physical structure. For example, a claimed measuring tape having electrical wiring information thereon, or a generically claimed substrate having a picture of a golf ball thereupon, would lack a functional relationship as the claims as a whole are directed towards conveying wiring information (unrelated to the measuring tape) or an aesthetically pleasing image (unrelated to the substrate) to the reader. Additionally, where the printed matter and product do not depend upon each other, no functional relationship exists. For example, in a kit containing a set of chemicals and a printed set of instructions for using the chemicals, the instructions are not related to that particular set of chemicals. _In re Ngai,_ 367 F.3d at 1339, 70 USPQ2d at 1864.

## II.    **FUNCTIONAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PRINTED MATTER AND ASSOCIATED SUBSTRATE MUST BE NEW AND NONOBVIOUS**

Once a functional relationship between the product and associated printed matter is found, the investigation shifts to the determination of whether the relationship is new and nonobvious. For example, a claim to a color-coded indicia on a container in which the color indicates the expiration date of the container may give rise to a functional relationship. The claim may, however, be anticipated by prior art that reads on the claimed invention, or by a combination of prior art that teaches the claimed invention.

## III.    **MACHINE-READABLE MEDIA**

When determining the scope of a claim directed to a computer-readable medium containing certain programming, the examiner should first look to the relationship between the programming and the intended computer system. Where the programming performs some function with respect to the computer with which it is associated, a functional relationship will be found. For instance, a claim to computer-readable medium programmed with attribute data objects that perform the function of facilitating retrieval, addition, and removal of information in the intended computer system, establishes a functional relationship such that the claimed attribute data objects are given patentable weight. See _Lowry,_ 32 F.3d at 1583-84, 32 USPQ2d at 1035.

However, where the claim as a whole is directed to conveying a message or meaning to a human reader independent of the intended computer system, and/or the computer-readable medium merely serves as a support for information or data, no functional relationship exists. For example, a claim to a memory stick containing tables of batting averages, or tracks of recorded music, utilizes the intended computer system merely as a support for the information. Such claims are directed toward conveying meaning to the human reader rather than towards establishing a functional relationship between recorded data and the computer.

A claim directed to a computer readable medium storing instructions or executable code that recites an abstract idea must be evaluated for eligibility under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**. See **[MPEP § 2106](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e197244.html)**.

# 2112    Requirements of Rejection Based on Inherency; Burden of Proof [R-01.2024]

_[Editor Note: This MPEP section is applicable regardless of whether an application is examined under the AIA or under pre-AIA law. For applications subject to the first inventor to file (FITF) provisions of the AIA, the relevant time is "before the effective filing date of the claimed invention".

The express, implicit, and inherent disclosures of a prior art reference may be relied upon in the rejection of claims under **[35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302383.html)**  or **[103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302450.html)**. "The inherent teaching of a prior art reference, a question of fact, arises both in the context of anticipation and obviousness." _In re Napier,_ 55 F.3d 610, 613, 34 USPQ2d 1782, 1784 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (affirmed a **[35 U.S.C. 103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302450.html)**  rejection based in part on inherent disclosure in one of the references). See also _In re Grasselli,_ 713 F.2d 731, 739, 218 USPQ 769, 775 (Fed. Cir. 1983).

## I.    **SOMETHING WHICH IS OLD DOES NOT BECOME PATENTABLE UPON THE DISCOVERY OF A NEW PROPERTY**

"[T]he discovery of a previously unappreciated property of a prior art composition, or of a scientific explanation for the prior art’s functioning, does not render the old composition patentably new to the discoverer." _Atlas Powder Co. v. IRECO Inc.,_ 190 F.3d 1342, 1347, 51 USPQ2d 1943, 1947 (Fed. Cir. 1999). Thus the claiming of a new use, new function or unknown property which is inherently present in the prior art does not necessarily make the claim patentable. _In re Best,_ 562 F.2d 1252, 1254, 195 USPQ 430, 433 (CCPA 1977). In _In re Crish,_ 393 F.3d 1253, 1258, 73 USPQ2d 1364, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2004), the court held that the claimed promoter sequence obtained by sequencing a prior art plasmid that was not previously sequenced was anticipated by the prior art plasmid which necessarily possessed the same DNA sequence as the claimed oligonucleotides. The court stated that "just as the discovery of properties of a known material does not make it novel, the identification and characterization of a prior art material also does not make it novel." _Id._ See also **[MPEP § 2112.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e201273.html)** with regard to inherency and product-by-process claims and **[MPEP § 2141.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e209106.html)** with regard to inherency and rejections under **[35 U.S.C. 103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302450.html)**.

## II.    **INHERENT FEATURE NEED NOT BE RECOGNIZED AT THE RELEVANT TIME**

There is no requirement that a person of ordinary skill in the art would have recognized the inherent disclosure _at the relevant time,_ but only that the subject matter is in fact inherent in the prior art reference. _Schering Corp. v. Geneva Pharm. Inc.,_ 339 F.3d 1373, 1377, 67 USPQ2d 1664, 1668 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (rejecting the contention that inherent anticipation requires recognition by a person of ordinary skill in the art before the critical date and allowing expert testimony with respect to post-critical date clinical trials to show inherency); see also _Toro Co. v. Deere & Co.,_ 355 F.3d 1313, 1320, 69 USPQ2d 1584, 1590 (Fed. Cir. 2004) ("[T]he fact that a characteristic is a necessary feature or result of a prior-art embodiment (that is itself sufficiently described and enabled) is enough for inherent anticipation, even if that fact was unknown at the time of the prior invention."); _Abbott Labs v. Geneva Pharms., Inc.,_ 182 F.3d 1315, 1319, 51 USPQ2d 1307, 1310 (Fed. Cir. 1999) ("If a product that is offered for sale inherently possesses each of the limitations of the claims, then the invention is on sale, whether or not the parties to the transaction recognize that the product possesses the claimed characteristics."); _Atlas Powder Co. v. IRECO, Inc.,_ 190 F.3d 1342, 1348-49, 51 USPQ2d 1943, 1947 (Fed. Cir. 1999) ("Because ‘sufficient aeration’ was inherent in the prior art, it is irrelevant that the prior art did not recognize the key aspect of [the] invention.... An inherent structure, composition, or function is not necessarily known."); _SmithKline Beecham Corp. v. Apotex Corp.,_ 403 F.3d 1331, 1343-44, 74 USPQ2d 1398, 1406-07 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (holding that a prior art patent to an anhydrous form of a compound "inherently" anticipated the claimed hemihydrate form of the compound because practicing the process in the prior art to manufacture the anhydrous compound "inherently results in at least trace amounts of" the claimed hemihydrate even if the prior art did not discuss or recognize the hemihydrate); _In re Omeprazole Patent Litigation,_ 483 F.3d 1364, 1373, 82 USPQ2d 1643, 1650 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (The court noted that although the inventors may not have recognized that a characteristic of the ingredients in the prior art method resulted in an _in situ_ formation of a separating layer, the _in situ_ formation was nevertheless inherent. "The record shows formation of the _in situ_ separating layer in the prior art even though that process was not recognized at the time. The new realization alone does not render that necessary [sic] prior art patentable.").

## III.    **A REJECTION UNDER 35 U.S.C. 102 AND 103 CAN BE MADE WHEN THE PRIOR ART PRODUCT SEEMS TO BE IDENTICAL EXCEPT THAT THE PRIOR ART IS SILENT AS TO AN INHERENT CHARACTERISTIC**

Where applicant claims a composition in terms of a function, property or characteristic and the composition of the prior art is the same as that of the claim but the function is not explicitly disclosed by the reference, the examiner may make a rejection under both **[35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302383.html)**  and **[103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302450.html)**. "There is nothing inconsistent in concurrent rejections for obviousness under **[35 U.S.C. 103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302450.html)**  and for anticipation under **[35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302383.html)**." _In re Best,_ 562 F.2d 1252, 1255 n.4, 195 USPQ 430, 433 n.4 (CCPA 1977). This same rationale should also apply to product, apparatus, and process claims claimed in terms of function, property or characteristic. Therefore, a **[35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302383.html)**  and **[103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302450.html)**  rejection is appropriate for these types of claims as well as for composition claims.

## IV.    **EXAMINER MUST PROVIDE RATIONALE OR EVIDENCE TO SHOW INHERENCY**

The fact that a certain result or characteristic may occur or be present in the prior art is not sufficient to establish the inherency of that result or characteristic. _In re Rijckaert,_ 9 F.3d 1531, 1534, 28 USPQ2d 1955, 1957 (Fed. Cir. 1993) (reversed rejection because inherency was based on what would result due to optimization of conditions, not what was necessarily present in the prior art); _In re Oelrich,_ 666 F.2d 578, 581-82, 212 USPQ 323, 326 (CCPA 1981). Also, "[a]n invitation to investigate is not an inherent disclosure" where a prior art reference "discloses no more than a broad genus of potential applications of its discoveries." _Metabolite Labs., Inc. v. Lab._ _Corp. of Am. Holdings,_ 370 F.3d 1354, 1367, 71 USPQ2d 1081, 1091 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (explaining that "[a] prior art reference that discloses a genus still does not inherently disclose all species within that broad category" but must be examined to see if a disclosure of the claimed species has been made or whether the prior art reference merely invites further experimentation to find the species).

"In relying upon the theory of inherency, the examiner must provide a basis in fact and/or technical reasoning to reasonably support the determination that the allegedly inherent characteristic necessarily flows from the teachings of the applied prior art." _Ex parte Levy_, 17 USPQ2d 1461, 1464 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1990) (emphasis in original). In _PAR Pharmaceutical, Inc. v. TWI Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,_ 773 F.3d 1186, 112 USPQ2d 1945 (Fed. Cir. 2014), the Federal Circuit remanded a decision to the district court because the record did not present sufficient evidence to prove inherency in the context of obviousness. The district court concluded the pharmacokinetic parameters of a claim are inherent properties of the obvious formulation. The Federal Circuit stated that while "inherency may support a missing claim limitation in an obviousness analysis", "the use of inherency, a doctrine originally rooted in anticipation, must be carefully circumscribed in the context of obviousness." _Id._ at 1194-95, 112 USPQ2d at 1952. "[I]n order to rely on inherency to establish the existence of a claim limitation in the prior art in an obviousness analysis – the limitation at issue necessarily must be present, or the natural result of the combination of elements explicitly disclosed by the prior art." _Id._ at 1195-96, 112 USPQ2d at 1952. But see, _Persion Pharms. LLC v. Alvogen Malta Operations LTD.,_ 945 F.3d 1184, 1191, 2019 USPQ2d 494084 (Fed. Cir. 2019), where the court stated that a proper finding of inherency does not require that all limitations are taught in a single reference, and that inherency may meet a missing claim limitation when the limitation is "the natural result of the _combination of prior art elements_." (emphasis in original). The court found that pharmacokinetic limitations of the asserted claims were inherently met by combining prior art references because the limitations were necessarily present in the prior art combination. _Id._ See also _Hospira, Inc. v. Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC,_ 946 F.3d 1322, 1329-32, 2020 USPQ2d 6227 (Fed. Cir. 2020).

In _In re Schreiber,_ 128 F.3d 1473, 44 USPQ2d 1429 (Fed. Cir. 1997), the court affirmed a finding that a prior patent to a conical spout used primarily to dispense oil from an oil can inherently performed the functions recited in applicant’s claim to a conical container top for dispensing popped popcorn. The examiner had asserted inherency based on the structural similarity between the patented spout and applicant’s disclosed top, i.e., both structures had the same general shape. The court stated:

> [N]othing in Schreiber’s [applicant’s] claim suggests that Schreiber’s container is 'of a different shape’ than Harz’s [patent]. In fact, [ ] an embodiment according to Harz (Fig. 5) and the embodiment depicted in figure 1 of Schreiber’s application have the same general shape. For that reason, the examiner was justified in concluding that the opening of a conically shaped top as disclosed by Harz is inherently of a size sufficient to ‘allow [ ] several kernels of popped popcorn to pass through at the same time’ and that the taper of Harz’s conically shaped top is inherently of such a shape ‘as to by itself jam up the popped popcorn before the end of the cone and permit the dispensing of only a few kernels at a shake of a package when the top is mounted to the container.’ The examiner therefore correctly found that Harz established a prima facie case of anticipation.

_Schreiber,_ 128 F.3d at 1478, 44 USPQ2d at 1432.

## V.    **ONCE A REFERENCE TEACHING PRODUCT APPEARING TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY IDENTICAL IS MADE THE BASIS OF A REJECTION, AND THE EXAMINER PRESENTS EVIDENCE OR REASONING TO SHOW INHERENCY, THE BURDEN OF PRODUCTION SHIFTS TO THE APPLICANT**

"[T]he PTO can require an applicant to prove that the prior art products do not necessarily or inherently possess the characteristics of his [or her] claimed product. Whether the rejection is based on ‘inherency’ under **[35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302383.html)**, on ‘_prima facie_ obviousness’ under **[35 U.S.C. 103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302450.html)**, jointly or alternatively, the burden of proof is the same." _In re Best,_ 562 F.2d 1252, 1255, 195 USPQ 430, 433-34 (CCPA 1977) (footnote and citation omitted). The burden of proof is similar to that required with respect to product-by-process claims. _In re Fitzgerald,_ 619 F.2d 67, 70, 205 USPQ 594, 596 (CCPA 1980) (citing _Best,_ 562 F.2d at 1255).

In _Fitzgerald,_ the claims were directed to a self-locking screw-threaded fastener comprising a metallic threaded fastener having patches of crystallizable thermoplastic bonded thereto. The claim further specified that the thermoplastic had a reduced degree of crystallization shrinkage. The specification disclosed that the locking fastener was made by heating the metal fastener to melt a thermoplastic blank which is pressed against the metal. After the thermoplastic adheres to the metal fastener, the end product is cooled by quenching in water. The examiner made a rejection based on a U.S. patent to Barnes. Barnes taught a self-locking fastener in which the patch of thermoplastic was made by depositing thermoplastic powder on a metallic fastener which was then heated. The end product was cooled in ambient air, by cooling air or by contacting the fastener with a water trough. The court first noted that the two fasteners were identical or only slightly different from each other. "Both fasteners possess the same utility, employ the same crystallizable polymer (nylon 11), and have an adherent plastic patch formed by melting and then cooling the polymer." _Id._ at 596 n.1, 619 F.2d at 70 n.1. The court then noted that the Board had found that Barnes’ cooling rate could reasonably be expected to result in a polymer possessing the claimed crystallization shrinkage rate. Applicants had not rebutted this finding with evidence that the shrinkage rate was indeed different. They had only argued that the crystallization shrinkage rate was dependent on the cool down rate and that the cool down rate of Barnes was much slower than theirs. Because a difference in the cool down rate does not necessarily result in a difference in shrinkage, objective evidence was required to rebut the **[35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302383.html)** /**[103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302450.html)**  _prima facie_ case.

In _Schreiber,_ 128 F.3d 1473, 1478, 44 USPQ2d 1429, 1432 (Fed.Cir.1997), the court held that applicant’s declaration failed to overcome a _prima facie_ case of anticipation because the declaration did not specify the dimensions of either the dispensing top that was tested or the popcorn that was used. Applicant’s declaration merely asserted that a conical dispensing top built according to a figure in the prior art patent was too small to jam and dispense popcorn and thus could not inherently perform the functions recited in applicant’s claims. The court pointed out the disclosure of the prior art patent was not limited to use as an oil can dispenser, but rather was broader than the precise configuration shown in the patent’s figure. The court also noted that the Board found as a factual matter that a scaled-up version of the top disclosed in the patent would be capable of performing the functions recited in applicant’s claim.

See **[MPEP § 2113](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e201450.html)** for more information on the analogous burden of proof applied to product-by-process claims.

# 2112.01    Composition, Product, and  Apparatus Claims [R-10.2019]

## I.    **PRODUCT AND APPARATUS CLAIMS — WHEN THE STRUCTURE RECITED IN THE REFERENCE IS SUBSTANTIALLY IDENTICAL TO THAT OF THE CLAIMS, CLAIMED PROPERTIES OR FUNCTIONS ARE PRESUMED TO BE INHERENT**

Where the claimed and prior art products are identical or substantially identical in structure or composition, or are produced by identical or substantially identical processes, a _prima facie_ case of either anticipation or obviousness has been established. _In re Best,_ 562 F.2d 1252, 1255, 195 USPQ 430, 433 (CCPA 1977). "When the PTO shows a sound basis for believing that the products of the applicant and the prior art are the same, the applicant has the burden of showing that they are not." _In re Spada,_ 911 F.2d 705, 709, 15 USPQ2d 1655, 1658 (Fed. Cir. 1990). Therefore, the _prima facie_ case can be rebutted by evidence showing that the prior art products do not necessarily possess the characteristics of the claimed product. _In re Best,_ 562 F.2d at 1255, 195 USPQ at 433. See also _Titanium Metals Corp._ _v. Banner,_ 778 F.2d 775, 227 USPQ 773 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (Claims were directed to a titanium alloy containing 0.2-0.4% Mo and 0.6-0.9% Ni having corrosion resistance. A Russian article disclosed a titanium alloy containing 0.25% Mo and 0.75% Ni but was silent as to corrosion resistance. The Federal Circuit held that the claim was anticipated because the percentages of Mo and Ni were squarely within the claimed ranges. The court went on to say that it was immaterial what properties the alloys had or who discovered the properties because the composition is the same and thus must necessarily exhibit the properties.).

See also _In re Ludtke,_ 441 F.2d 660, 169 USPQ 563 (CCPA 1971) (Claim 1 was directed to a parachute canopy having concentric circumferential panels radially separated from each other by radially extending tie lines. The panels were separated "such that the critical velocity of each successively larger panel will be less than the critical velocity of the previous panel, whereby said parachute will sequentially open and thus gradually decelerate." The court found that the claim was anticipated by Menget. Menget taught a parachute having three circumferential panels separated by tie lines. The court upheld the rejection finding that applicant had failed to show that Menget did not possess the functional characteristics of the claims.); _Northam Warren Corp._ _v._ _D. F. Newfield Co.,_ 7 F.Supp. 773, 22 USPQ 313 (E.D.N.Y. 1934) (A patent to a pencil for cleaning fingernails was held invalid because a pencil of the same structure for writing was found in the prior art.).

## II.    **COMPOSITION CLAIMS — IF THE COMPOSITION IS PHYSICALLY THE SAME, IT MUST HAVE THE SAME PROPERTIES**

"Products of identical chemical composition can not have mutually exclusive properties." _In re Spada,_ 911 F.2d 705, 709, 15 USPQ2d 1655, 1658 (Fed. Cir. 1990). A chemical composition and its properties are inseparable. Therefore, if the prior art teaches the identical chemical structure, the properties applicant discloses and/or claims are necessarily present. _Id._ (Applicant argued that the claimed composition was a pressure sensitive adhesive containing a tacky polymer while the product of the reference was hard and abrasion resistant. "The Board correctly found that the virtual identity of monomers and procedures sufficed to support a _prima facie_ case of unpatentability of Spada’s polymer latexes for lack of novelty.").

## III.    **PRODUCT CLAIMS – NONFUNCTIONAL PRINTED MATTER DOES NOT DISTINGUISH CLAIMED PRODUCT FROM OTHERWISE IDENTICAL PRIOR ART PRODUCT**

Where the only difference between a prior art product and a claimed product is printed matter that is not functionally related to the product, the content of the printed matter will not distinguish the claimed product from the prior art. _In re Ngai,_ 367 F.3d 1336, 1339, 70 USPQ2d 1862, 1864 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (Claim at issue was a kit requiring instructions and a buffer agent. The Federal Circuit held that the claim was anticipated by a prior art reference that taught a kit that included instructions and a buffer agent, even though the content of the instructions differed, explaining "[i]f we were to adopt [applicant’s] position, anyone could continue patenting a product indefinitely provided that they add a new instruction sheet to the product."). See also _In re Gulack,_ 703 F.2d 1381, 1385-86, 217 USPQ 401, 404 (Fed. Cir. 1983) ( "Where the printed matter is not functionally related to the substrate, the printed matter will not distinguish the invention from the prior art in terms of patentability….[T]he critical question is whether there exists any new and unobvious functional relationship between the printed matter and the substrate." ); _In re Miller,_ 418 F.2d 1392, 1396 (CCPA 1969) (finding a new and nonobvious relationship between a measuring cup and writing showing how to "half" a recipe); _In re Seid,_ 161 F.2d 229, 73 USPQ 431 (CCPA 1947) (matters relating to ornamentation only which have no mechanical function cannot be relied upon to patentably distinguish the claimed invention from the prior art); _In re Xiao,_ 462 Fed. App'x 947, 950-51 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (non-precedential) (affirming an obviousness rejection of claims directed to a tumbler lock that used letters instead of numbers and had a wild-card label instead of one of the letters); _In re Bryan,_ 323 Fed. App'x 898, 901 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (non-precedential) (printed matter on game cards bears no new and nonobvious functional relationship to game board).

The court has extended the rationale in the printed matter cases, in which, for example, written instructions are added to a known product, to method claims in which "an instruction limitation" (i.e., a limitation "informing" someone about the existence of an inherent property of that method) is added to a method known in the art. _King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. v. Eon Labs,_ Inc., 616 F.3d 1267, 1279, 95 USPQ2d 1833, 1842 (2010). Similar to the inquiry for products with printed matter thereon, for such method cases the relevant inquiry is whether a new and nonobvious functional relationship with the known method exists. In _King Pharma,_ the court found that the relevant determination is whether the "instruction limitation" has a "new and unobvious functional relationship" with the known method of administering the drug with food. _Id._ The court held that the relationship was non-functional because "[i]nforming a patient about the benefits of a drug in no way transforms the process of taking the drug with food." _Id._ That is, the actual method of taking a drug with food is the same regardless of whether the patient is informed of the benefits. _Id._ "In other words, the ‘informing’ limitation ‘in no way depends on the method, and the method does not depend on the ‘informing’ limitation.’" _Id._ (citing _In re Ngai,_ 367 F.3d 1336, 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2004)); see also _In re Kao,_ 639 F.3d 1057, 1072-73, 98 USPQ2d 1799, 1811-12 (Fed. Cir. 2011).

# 2112.02    Process Claims [R-01.2024]

## I.    **PROCESS CLAIMS — PRIOR ART DEVICE ANTICIPATES A CLAIMED PROCESS IF THE DEVICE CARRIES OUT THE PROCESS DURING NORMAL OPERATION**

Under the principles of inherency, if a prior art device, in its normal and usual operation, would necessarily perform the method claimed, then the method claimed will be considered to be anticipated by the prior art device. When the prior art device is the same as a device described in the specification for carrying out the claimed method, it can be assumed the device will inherently perform the claimed process. _In re King,_ 801 F.2d 1324, 231 USPQ 136 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (The claims were directed to a method of enhancing color effects produced by ambient light through a process of absorption and reflection of the light off a coated substrate. A prior art reference to _Donley_ disclosed a glass substrate coated with silver and metal oxide 200-800 angstroms thick. While Donley disclosed using the coated substrate to produce architectural colors, the absorption and reflection mechanisms of the claimed process were not disclosed. However, King’s specification disclosed using a coated substrate of Donley’s structure for use in his process. The Federal Circuit upheld the Board’s finding that "Donley inherently performs the function disclosed in the method claims on appeal when that device is used in ‘normal and usual operation’" and found that a _prima facie_ case of anticipation was made out. _Id._ at 138, 801 F.2d at 1326. It was up to applicant to prove that Donley’s structure would not perform the claimed method when placed in ambient light.). See also _In re Best,_ 562 F.2d 1252, 1255, 195 USPQ 430, 433 (CCPA 1977) (Applicant claimed a process for preparing a hydrolytically-stable zeolitic aluminosilicate which included a step of "cooling the steam zeolite ... at a rate sufficiently rapid that the cooled zeolite exhibits an X-ray diffraction pattern ...." All the process limitations were expressly disclosed by a U.S. patent to Hansford except the cooling step. The court stated that any sample of Hansford’s zeolite would necessarily be cooled to facilitate subsequent handling. Therefore, rejections under **[35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302383.html)**  and **[103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302450.html)**  were properly made. Applicant had failed to introduce any evidence comparing X-ray diffraction patterns showing a difference in cooling rate between the claimed process and that of Hansford or any data showing that the process of Hansford would result in a product with a different X-ray diffraction. Either type of evidence would have rebutted the rejections under **[35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302383.html)**. A further analysis would be necessary to determine if the process was nonobvious under **[35 U.S.C. 103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302450.html)**.); _Ex parte_ _Novitski,_ 26 USPQ2d 1389 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1993) (The Board rejected a claim directed to a method for protecting a plant from plant pathogenic nematodes by inoculating the plant with a nematode inhibiting strain of _P. cepacia._ A U.S. patent to _Dart_ disclosed inoculation using _P. cepacia_ type Wisconsin 526 bacteria for protecting the plant from fungal disease. Dart was silent as to nematode inhibition but the Board concluded that nematode inhibition was an inherent property of the bacteria. The Board noted that applicant had stated in the specification that Wisconsin 526 possesses an 18% nematode inhibition rating.).

## II.    **PROCESS OF USE CLAIMS — NEW AND NONOBVIOUS USES OF OLD STRUCTURES AND COMPOSITIONS MAY BE PATENTABLE**

The discovery of a new use for an old structure based on unknown properties of the structure might be patentable to the discoverer as a process of using. _In re Hack,_ 245 F.2d 246, 248, 114 USPQ 161, 163 (CCPA 1957). However, when the claim recites using an old composition or structure and the "use" is directed to a result or property of that composition or structure, then the claim is anticipated. _In re_ _May,_ 574 F.2d 1082, 1090, 197 USPQ 601, 607 (CCPA 1978) (Claims 1 and 6, directed to a method of effecting nonaddictive analgesia (pain reduction) in animals, were found to be anticipated by the applied prior art which disclosed the same compounds, as well as a method of using them for effecting analgesia but which was silent as to addiction. The court upheld the rejection and stated that the inventors had merely found a new property of the compound and such a discovery did not constitute a new use. The court went on to reverse the obviousness rejection of claims 2-5 and 7-10 which recited a process of using a new compound. The court relied on evidence showing that the nonaddictive property of the new compound was unexpected.). See also _In re Tomlinson,_ 363 F.2d 928, 150 USPQ 623 (CCPA 1966) (The claim was directed to a process of inhibiting light degradation of polypropylene by mixing it with one of a genus of compounds, including nickel dithiocarbamate. A reference taught mixing polypropylene with nickel dithiocarbamate to lower heat degradation. The court held that the claims read on the obvious process of mixing polypropylene with the nickel dithiocarbamate and that the preamble of the claim was merely directed to the result of mixing the two materials. "While the references do not show a specific recognition of that result, its discovery by appellants is tantamount only to finding a property in the old composition." 363 F.2d at 934, 150 USPQ at 628 (emphasis in original)).

# 2113    Product-by-Process Claims [R-01.2024]

## I.    **PRODUCT-BY-PROCESS CLAIMS ARE NOT LIMITED TO THE MANIPULATIONS OF THE RECITED STEPS, ONLY THE STRUCTURE IMPLIED BY THE STEPS**

"[E]ven though product-by-process claims are limited by and defined by the process, determination of patentability is based on the product itself. The patentability of a product does not depend on its method of production. If the product in the product-by-process claim is the same as or obvious from a product of the prior art, the claim is unpatentable even though the prior product was made by a different process." _In re Thorpe,_ 777 F.2d 695, 698, 227 USPQ 964, 966 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (citations omitted) (Claim was directed to a novolac color developer. The process of making the developer was allowed. The difference between the inventive process and the prior art was the addition of metal oxide and carboxylic acid as separate ingredients instead of adding the more expensive pre-reacted metal carboxylate. The product-by-process claim was rejected because the end product, in both the prior art and the allowed process, ends up containing metal carboxylate. The fact that the metal carboxylate is not directly added, but is instead produced in-situ does not change the end product.). Furthermore, "[b]ecause validity is determined based on the requirements of patentability, a patent is invalid if a product made by the process recited in a product-by-process claim is anticipated by or obvious from prior art products, even if those prior art products are made by different processes." _Amgen Inc. v. F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd.,_ 580 F.3d 1340, 1370 n. 14, 92 USPQ2d 1289, 1312, n. 14 (Fed. Cir. 2009). See also _Biogen MA Inc. v. EMD Serono, Inc.,_ 976 F.3d 1326, 1334, 2020 USPQ2d 11129 (Fed. Cir. 2020) ("Biogen is certainly correct that the scope of composition and method of treatment claims is generally subject to distinctly different analyses. But where, as here, the novelty of the method of administration rests wholly on the novelty of the composition administered, which in turn rests on the novelty of the source limitation, the _Amgen_ analysis will necessarily result in the same conclusion on anticipation for both forms of claims."); _United Therapeutics Corp. v Liquidia Techs., Inc.,_ 74 F.4th 1360, 1373, 2023 USPQ2d 862 (Fed. Cir. 2023) (the court held that product-by-process claims were properly rejected as "anticipated by a disclosure of the same product irrespective of the processes by which they are made."); and _Purdue Pharma v. Epic Pharma,_ 811 F.3d 1345, 117 USPQ2d 1733 (Fed. Cir. 2016). However, in the context of an infringement analysis, a product-by-process claim is only infringed by a product made by the process recited in the claim. _Id._ at 1370 ("a product in the prior art made by a different process can anticipate a product-by-process claim, but an accused product made by a different process cannot infringe a product-by-process claim").

The structure implied by the process steps should be considered when assessing the patentability of product-by-process claims over the prior art, especially where the product can only be defined by the process steps by which the product is made, or where the manufacturing process steps would be expected to impart distinctive structural characteristics to the final product. See, e.g., _In re Garnero,_ 412 F.2d 276, 279, 162 USPQ 221, 223 (CCPA 1979) (holding "interbonded by interfusion" to limit structure of the claimed composite and noting that terms such as "welded," "intermixed," "ground in place," "press fitted," and "etched" are capable of construction as structural limitations). See also _In re Nordt Dev. Co.,_ 881 F.3d 1371,1375-76, 125 USPQ2d 1817, 1820 (Fed. Cir. 2018)(holding "the specification demonstrates that ‘injected molded’ connotes an integral structure," and discussing several cases since _Garnero_ that held "limitations to convey structure even when they also describe a process of manufacture").

## II.    **ONCE A PRODUCT APPEARING TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY IDENTICAL IS FOUND AND A PRIOR ART REJECTION IS MADE, THE BURDEN SHIFTS TO THE APPLICANT TO SHOW AN NONOBVIOUS DIFFERENCE**

"The Patent Office bears a lesser burden of proof in making out a case of _prima facie_ obviousness for product-by-process claims because of their peculiar nature" than when a product is claimed in the conventional fashion. _In re Fessmann,_ 489 F.2d 742, 744, 180 USPQ 324, 326 (CCPA 1974). Once the examiner provides a rationale tending to show that the claimed product appears to be the same or similar to that of the prior art, although produced by a different process, the burden shifts to applicant to come forward with evidence establishing an nonobvious difference between the claimed product and the prior art product. _In re Marosi,_ 710 F.2d 799, 803, 218 USPQ 289, 292-33 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (The claims were directed to a zeolite manufactured by mixing together various inorganic materials in solution and heating the resultant gel to form a crystalline metal silicate essentially free of alkali metal. The prior art described a process of making a zeolite which, after ion exchange to remove alkali metal, appeared to be "essentially free of alkali metal." The court upheld the rejection because the applicant had not come forward with any evidence that the prior art was not "essentially free of alkali metal" and therefore a different and nonobvious product.).

See also _Ex parte Gray,_ 10 USPQ2d 1922 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1989) (The prior art disclosed human nerve growth factor (b-NGF) isolated from human placental tissue. The claim was directed to b-NGF produced through genetic engineering techniques. The factor produced seemed to be substantially the same whether isolated from tissue or produced through genetic engineering. While the applicant questioned the purity of the prior art factor, no concrete evidence of an nonobvious difference was presented. The Board stated that the dispositive issue is whether the claimed factor exhibits any unexpected properties compared with the factor disclosed by the prior art. The Board further stated that the applicant should have made some comparison between the two factors to establish unexpected properties since the materials appeared to be identical or only slightly different.).

## III.    **A REJECTION BASED ALTERNATIVELY ON 35 U.S.C. 102 OR 103 FOR PRODUCT-BY-PROCESS CLAIMS HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE COURTS**

"[T]he lack of physical description in a product-by-process claim makes determination of the patentability of the claim more difficult, since in spite of the fact that the claim may recite only process limitations, it is the patentability of the product claimed and not of the recited process steps which must be established. We are therefore of the opinion that when the prior art discloses a product which reasonably appears to be either identical with or only slightly different than a product claimed in a product-by-process claim, a rejection based alternatively on either **[section 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302383.html)**  or **[section 103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302450.html)**  of the statute is eminently fair and acceptable. As a practical matter, the Patent Office is not equipped to manufacture products by the myriad of processes put before it and then obtain prior art products and make physical comparisons therewith." _In re Brown,_ 459 F.2d 531, 535, 173 USPQ 685, 688 (CCPA 1972). Office personnel should note that reliance on the alternative grounds of **[35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//al_d1fbe1_234ed_52.html)**  or **[35 U.S.C. 103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//al_d1fbe1_19797_b0.html)**  does not eliminate the need to explain both the anticipation and obviousness aspects of the rejections.

# 2114    Apparatus and Article Claims — Functional Language [R-07.2015]

For a discussion of case law which provides guidance in interpreting the functional portion of means-plus-function limitations see **[MPEP § 2181](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e219279.html)** - **[§ 2186](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e220631.html)**.

## I.    **INHERENCY AND FUNCTIONAL LIMITATIONS IN APPARATUS CLAIMS**

Features of an apparatus may be recited either structurally or functionally. _In re Schreiber,_ 128 F.3d 1473, 1478, 44 USPQ2d 1429, 1432 (Fed. Cir. 1997). See also **[MPEP § 2173.05(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e218409.html)**. If an examiner concludes that a functional limitation is an inherent characteristic of the prior art, then to establish a prima case of anticipation or obviousness, the examiner should explain that the prior art structure inherently possesses the functionally defined limitations of the claimed apparatus. _In re Schreiber,_ 128 F.3d at 1478, 44 USPQ2d at 1432. See also _Bettcher Industries, Inc. v. Bunzl USA, Inc.,_ 661 F.3d 629, 639-40, 100 USPQ2d 1433, 1440 (Fed. Cir. 2011). The burden then shifts to applicant to establish that the prior art does not possess the characteristic relied on. _In re Schreiber,_ 128 F.3d at 1478, 44 USPQ2d at 1432; _In re Swinehart,_ 439 F.2d 210, 213, 169 USPQ 226, 228 (CCPA 1971) ("where the Patent Office has reason to believe that a functional limitation asserted to be critical for establishing novelty in the claimed subject matter may, in fact, be an inherent characteristic of the prior art, it possesses the authority to require the applicant to prove that the subject matter shown to be in the prior art does not possess the characteristic relied on").

## II.    **MANNER OF OPERATING THE DEVICE DOES NOT DIFFERENTIATE APPARATUS CLAIM FROM THE PRIOR ART**

"[A]pparatus claims cover what a device _is,_ not what a device _does_." _Hewlett-Packard Co._ _v._ _Bausch & Lomb Inc.,_ 909 F.2d 1464, 1469, 15 USPQ2d 1525, 1528 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (emphasis in original). A claim containing a "recitation with respect to the manner in which a claimed apparatus is intended to be employed does not differentiate the claimed apparatus from a prior art apparatus" if the prior art apparatus teaches all the structural limitations of the claim. _Ex parte Masham,_ 2 USPQ2d 1647 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1987) (The preamble of claim 1 recited that the apparatus was "for mixing flowing developer material" and the body of the claim recited "means for mixing ..., said mixing means being stationary and completely submerged in the developer material." The claim was rejected over a reference which taught all the structural limitations of the claim for the intended use of mixing flowing developer. However, the mixer was only partially submerged in the developer material. The Board held that the amount of submersion is immaterial to the structure of the mixer and thus the claim was properly rejected.).

## III.    **A PRIOR ART DEVICE CAN PERFORM ALL THE FUNCTIONS OF THE APPARATUS CLAIM AND STILL NOT ANTICIPATE THE CLAIM**

Even if the prior art device performs all the functions recited in the claim, the prior art cannot anticipate the claim if there is any structural difference. It should be noted, however, that means-plus-function limitations are met by structures which are equivalent to the corresponding structures recited in the specification. _In re Donaldson,_ 16 F.3d 1189, 1193, 29 USPQ2d 1845, 1848 (Fed. Cir. 1994). See also _In re Robertson,_ 169 F.3d 743, 745, 49 USPQ2d 1949, 1951 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (The claims were drawn to a disposable diaper having three fastening elements. The reference disclosed two fastening elements that could perform the same function as the three fastening elements in the claims. The court construed the claims to require three separate elements and held that the reference did not disclose a separate third fastening element, either expressly or inherently.).

## IV.    **DETERMINING WHETHER A COMPUTER-IMPLEMENTED FUNCTIONAL CLAIM LIMITATION IS PATENTABLE OVER THE PRIOR ART UNDER 35 U.S.C. 102 AND 103**

Functional claim language that is not limited to a specific structure covers all devices that are capable of performing the recited function. Therefore, if the prior art discloses a device that can inherently perform the claimed function, a rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302383.html)**  and/or **[35 U.S.C. 103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//al_d1fbe1_19797_b0.html)**  may be appropriate. See _In re Translogic Technology, Inc.,_ 504 F.3d 1249, 1258, 84 USPQ2d 1929, 1935-1936 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (The claims were drawn to multiplexer circuit. The patent at issue claimed "coupled to" and "coupled to receive" between various portions of the circuitry. In reference to the claim phrase "input terminals ‘coupled to receive’ first and second input variables," the court held that "the claimed circuit does not require any specific input or connection … [a]s such, ‘coupled to’ and ‘coupled to receive’ are clearly different … [a]s shown in [the figures of the] patent, input terminals … only need to be ‘capable of receiving’ an input variable for the multiplexer circuit as claimed". Therefore, the specification supported the claim construction "that ‘coupled to receive’ means ‘capable of receiving.’"); _Intel Corp. v. U.S. Int'l Trade Comm’n,_ 946 F.2d 821, 832, 20 USPQ2d 1161, 1171 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (The court held that "programmable" claim language required only that the accused product could be programmed to perform the claimed functionality.);_In re Schreiber,_ 128 F.3d 1473, 1478, 44 USPQ2d 1429, 1432 (Fed. Cir. 1997); _In re Best,_ 562 F.2d 1252, 1254, 195 USPQ 430, 433 (CCPA 1977); _In re Ludtke,_ 441 F.2d 660, 663-64, 169 USPQ 563, 566-67 (CCPA 1971); _In re Swinehart,_ 439 F.2d 210, 212-13, 169 USPQ 226, 228-29 (CCPA 1971) ("[I]t is elementary that the mere recitation of a newly discovered function or property, inherently possessed by things in the prior art, does not cause a claim drawn to those things to distinguish over the prior art"). See **[MPEP § 2112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e201036.html)** for more information.

Conversely, computer-implemented functional claim limitations may narrow the functionality of the device, by limiting the specific structure capable of performing the recited function. _Nazomi Communications, Inc. v. Nokia Corp.,_ 739 F.3d 1339, 1345, 109 USPQ2d 1258, 1262 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (The claims were drawn to a CPU that can perform processing of both register-based and stack-based instructions. Appellant alleged infringement of the claims based on claim construction requiring only hardware capable of performing the claimed functionalities. Contrasted with the finding of _Intel Corp. v. U.S. Int'l Trade Comm’n,_ 846 F.2d 821, 832, 20 USPQ2d 1161, 1171 (Fed. Cir. 1991), the court found that "[s]ince hardware cannot meet these limitations in the absence of enabling software, the claims are properly construed as claiming an apparatus comprising a combination of hardware and software capable of practicing the claim limitations.").

Computer-implemented functional claim limitations may also be broad because the term "computer" is commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to describe a variety of devices with varying degrees of complexity and capabilities. _In re Paulsen,_ 30 F.3d 1475, 1479-80, 31 USPQ2d 1671, 1674 (Fed. Cir. 1994). Therefore, a claim containing the term "computer" should not be construed as limited to a computer having a specific set of characteristics and capabilities, unless the term is modified by other claim terms or clearly defined in the specification to be different from its common meaning. _Id._ In _Paulsen,_ the claims, directed to a portable computer, were rejected as anticipated under **[35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302383.html)**  by a reference that disclosed a calculator, because the term "computer" was given the broadest reasonable interpretation consistent with the specification to include a calculator, and a calculator was considered to be a particular type of computer by those of ordinary skill in the art. _Id._

When determining whether a computer-implemented functional claim would have been obvious, examiners should note that broadly claiming an automated means to replace a manual function to accomplish the same result does not distinguish over the prior art. See _Leapfrog Enters., Inc. v. Fisher-Price, Inc.,_ 485 F.3d 1157, 1161, 82 USPQ2d 1687, 1691 (Fed. Cir. 2007) ("Accommodating a prior art mechanical device that accomplishes [a desired] goal to modern electronics would have been reasonably obvious to one of ordinary skill in designing children’s learning devices. Applying modern electronics to older mechanical devices has been commonplace in recent years."); _In re Venner,_ 262 F.2d 91, 95, 120 USPQ 193, 194 (CCPA 1958); see also **[MPEP § 2144.04](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e210929.html)**. Furthermore, implementing a known function on a computer has been deemed obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art if the automation of the known function on a general purpose computer is nothing more than the predictable use of prior art elements according to their established functions. _KSR Int’l Co. v. Teleflex Inc.,_ 550 U.S. 398, 417, 82 USPQ2d 1385, 1396 (2007); see also **[MPEP § 2143](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e209516.html)**, Exemplary Rationales D and F. Likewise, it has been found to be obvious to adapt an existing process to incorporate Internet and Web browser technologies for communicating and displaying information because these technologies had become commonplace for those functions. _Muniauction, Inc. v. Thomson Corp.,_ 532 F.3d 1318, 1326-27, 87 USPQ2d 1350, 1357 (Fed. Cir. 2008).

For more information on the obviousness determination, see **[MPEP § 2141](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e208143.html)**.

# 2115    Material or Article Worked Upon by Apparatus [R-07.2015]

##    **MATERIAL OR ARTICLE WORKED UPON DOES NOT LIMIT APPARATUS CLAIMS**

Claim analysis is highly fact-dependent. A claim is only limited by positively recited elements. Thus, "[i]nclusion of the material or article worked upon by a structure being claimed does not impart patentability to the claims." _In re Otto,_ 312 F.2d 937, 136 USPQ 458, 459 (CCPA 1963); see also _In re Young,_ 75 F.2d 996, 25 USPQ 69 (CCPA 1935).

In _Otto,_ the claims were directed to a core member for hair curlers (i.e., a particular device) and a method of making the core member (i.e., a particular method of making that device) and "not to a method of curling hair wherein th[e] particular device is used." 312 F.2d at 940. The court held that patentability of the claims cannot be based "upon a certain procedure for curling hair using th[e] device and involving a number of steps in the process." The court noted that "the process is irrelevant as is the recitation involving the hair being wound around the core" in terms of determining patentability of the particular device. _Id._ Therefore, the inclusion of the material or article worked upon by a structure being claimed does not impart patentability to the claims.

In _Young,_ a claim to a machine for making concrete beams included a limitation to the concrete reinforced members made by the machine as well as the structural elements of the machine itself. The court held that the inclusion of the article formed within the body of the claim did not, without more, make the claim patentable.

In _In re Casey,_ 370 F.2d 576, 152 USPQ 235 (CCPA 1967), an apparatus claim recited "[a] taping machine comprising a supporting structure, a brush attached to said supporting structure, said brush being formed with projecting bristles which terminate in free ends to collectively define a surface to which adhesive tape will detachably adhere, and means for providing relative motion between said brush and said supporting structure while said adhesive tape is adhered to said surface." An obviousness rejection was made over a reference to Kienzle which taught a machine for perforating sheets. The court upheld the rejection stating that "the references in claim 1 to adhesive tape handling do not expressly or impliedly require any particular structure in addition to that of Kienzle." _Id._ at 580-81. The perforating device had the structure of the taping device as claimed, the difference was in the use of the device, and "the manner or method in which such machine is to be utilized is not germane to the issue of patentability of the machine itself." _Id._ at 580.

Note that this line of cases is limited to claims directed to machinery which works upon an article or material in its intended use.

# 2116    Novel, Nonobvious Starting Material or End Product [R-07.2022]

# 2116.01    Novel, Nonobvious Starting Material or End Product [R-10.2019]

All the limitations of a claim must be considered when weighing the differences between the claimed invention and the prior art in determining the obviousness of a process or method claim. See **[MPEP § 2143.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e210501.html)**.

_In re Ochiai,_ 71 F.3d 1565, 37 USPQ2d 1127 (Fed. Cir. 1995) and _In re Brouwer,_ 77 F.3d 422, 37 USPQ2d 1663 (Fed. Cir. 1996) addressed the issue of whether an otherwise conventional process could be patented if it were limited to making or using a nonobvious product. In both cases, the Federal Circuit held that the use of _per se_ rules is improper in applying the test for obviousness under **[35 U.S.C. 103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302450.html)**. Rather, **[35 U.S.C. 103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302450.html)**  requires a highly fact-dependent analysis involving taking the claimed subject matter as a whole and comparing it to the prior art. "A process yielding a novel and nonobvious product may nonetheless be obvious; conversely, a process yielding a well-known product may yet be nonobvious." _TorPharm, Inc. v. Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,_ 336 F.3d 1322, 1327, 67 USPQ2d 1511, 1514 (Fed. Cir. 2003).

Interpreting the claimed invention as a whole requires consideration of all claim limitations. Thus, proper claim construction requires treating language in a process claim which recites the making or using of a nonobvious product as a material limitation. The decision in _Ochiai_ specifically dispelled any distinction between processes of making a product and methods of using a product with regard to the effect of any product limitations in either type of claim.

As noted in _Brouwer,_ 77 F.3d at 425, 37 USPQ2d at 1666, the inquiry as to whether a claimed invention would have been obvious is "highly fact-specific by design." Accordingly, obviousness must be assessed on a case-by-case basis. The following decisions are illustrative of the lack of _per se_ rules in applying the test for obviousness under **[35 U.S.C. 103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302450.html)**  and of the fact-intensive comparison of claimed processes with the prior art: _In re Durden,_ 763 F.2d 1406, 226 USPQ 359 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (The examiner rejected a claim directed to a process in which patentable starting materials were reacted to form patentable end products. The prior art showed the same chemical reaction mechanism applied to other chemicals. The court held that the process claim was obvious over the prior art.); _In re Albertson,_ 332 F.2d 379, 141 USPQ 730 (CCPA 1964) (Process of chemically reducing one novel, nonobvious material to obtain another novel, nonobvious material was claimed. The process was held obvious because the reduction reaction was old.); _In re Kanter,_ 399 F.2d 249, 158 USPQ 331 (CCPA 1968) (Process of siliconizing a patentable base material to obtain a patentable product was claimed. Rejection based on prior art teaching the siliconizing process as applied to a different base material was upheld.); Cf. _In re Pleuddemann,_ 910 F.2d 823, 15 USPQ2d 1738 (Fed. Cir. 1990) (Methods of bonding polymer and filler using a novel silane coupling agent held patentable even though methods of bonding using other silane coupling agents were well known because the process could not be conducted without the new agent); _In re Kuehl,_ 475 F.2d 658, 177 USPQ 250 (CCPA 1973) (Process of cracking hydrocarbons using novel zeolite catalyst found to be patentable even though catalytic cracking process was old. "The test under 103 is whether in view of the prior art the invention as a whole would have been obvious at the time it was made, and the prior art here does not include the zeolite, ZK-22. The obviousness of the process of cracking hydrocarbons with ZK-22 as a catalyst must be determined without reference to knowledge of ZK-22 and its properties." 475 F.2d at 664-665, 177 USPQ at 255); and _In re Mancy,_ 499 F.2d 1289, 182 USPQ 303 (CCPA 1974) (Claim to a process for the production of a known antibiotic by cultivating a novel, nonobvious microorganism was found to be patentable.).

# 2117    Markush Claims [R-01.2024]

## I.    **MARKUSH CLAIM**

A "Markush" claim recites a list of alternatively useable members. _In re Harnisch,_ 631 F.2d 716, 719-20, 206 USPQ 300, 302-304 (CCPA 1980); _Ex parte Markush,_ 1925 Dec. Comm'r Pat. 126, 127 (1924). The listing of specified alternatives within a Markush claim is referred to as a Markush group or Markush grouping. _Abbott Labs v. Baxter Pharmaceutical Products, Inc.,_ 334 F.3d 1274, 1280-81, 67 USPQ2d 1191, 1196-97 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (citing to several sources that describe Markush groups). Claim language defined by a Markush grouping requires selection from a closed group "consisting of" the alternative members. _Id._ at 1280, 67 USPQ2d at 1196. See also _Amgen Inc. v. Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC,_ 945 F.3d 1368, 1376-78, 2020 USPQ2d 3197 (Fed. Cir. 2020) (stating that there is a strong presumption that a claim element set off with "consisting of" is closed to unrecited elements.). See **[MPEP § 2111.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e200824.html)**, subsection II, for a discussion of the term "consisting of" in the context of Markush groupings.

Treatment of claims reciting alternatives is not governed by the particular format used (e.g., alternatives may be set forth as "a material selected from the group consisting of A, B, and C" or "wherein the material is A, B, or C"). See, e.g., the _Supplementary Examination Guidelines for Determining Compliance with 35 U.S.C. 112 and for Treatment of Related Issues in Patent Applications_ (_"Supplementary Guidelines"_), 76 Fed. Reg. 7162 (February 9, 2011). Claims that set forth a list of alternatives from which a selection is to be made are typically referred to as Markush claims, after the appellant in _Ex parte Markush,_ 1925 Dec. Comm’r Pat. 126, 127 (1924). Although the term "Markush claim" is used throughout the MPEP, any claim that recites alternatively usable members, regardless of format, should be treated as a Markush claim. Inventions in metallurgy, refractories, ceramics, chemistry, pharmacology and biology are most frequently claimed under the Markush formula, but purely mechanical features or process steps may also be claimed by using the Markush style of claiming. See, e.g., _Fresenius USA, Inc. v. Baxter Int’l, Inc.,_ 582 F.3d 1288, 1297-98, 92 USPQ2d 1163, 1170-1172 (Fed. Cir. 2009)(claim to a hemodialysis apparatus required "at least one unit selected from the group consisting of (i) a dialysate-preparation unit, (ii) a dialysate-circulation unit, (iii) an ultrafiltrate-removal unit, and (iv) a dialysate-monitoring unit" and a user/machine interface operably connected thereto); _In re Harnisch,_ 631 F.2d 716, 206 USPQ 300 (CCPA 1980)(defining alternative moieties of a chemical compound with Markush groupings).

A Markush grouping is proper if the members of a group share a single structural similarity and a common use. See subsections II - IV, below, for guidelines regarding the determination of whether a Markush grouping is improper.

See **[MPEP § 2111.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e200824.html)** and **[MPEP § 2173.05(h)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e218467.html)** for discussions of when a Markush grouping may be indefinite under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)**  (e.g., if the list of alternatives is not a closed grouping, or if a Markush group is so expansive that persons skilled in the art cannot determine the metes and bounds of the claimed invention).

See **[MPEP § 803.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e98237.html)** for information pertaining to the election, search, and examination of claims that include at least one Markush grouping.

## II.    **IMPROPER MARKUSH GROUPING**

A Markush claim may be rejected under judicially approved "improper Markush grouping" principles when the claim contains an improper grouping of alternatively useable members. A Markush claim contains an "improper Markush grouping" if either: (1) the members of the Markush group do not share a "single structural similarity" or (2) the members do not share a common use. _Supplementary Guidelines_ at 7166 (citing _In re Harnisch,_ 631 F.2d 716, 721-22, 206 USPQ 300, 305 (CCPA 1980)).

Where a Markush grouping describes part of a combination or process, the members following "selected from the group consisting of" (or a similar introductory phrase) must be substitutable, one for the other, with the expectation that the same intended result would be achieved. _Multilayer Stretch Cling Film Holdings, Inc. v. Berry Plastics Corp.,_ 831 F.3d 1350, 1357, 119 USPQ2d 1773, 1779 (Fed. Cir. 2016)("It is generally understood that … the members of the Markush group … are alternatively usable for the purposes of the invention … .")(citations omitted). Where a Markush grouping describes part of a chemical compound, regardless of whether the claim is limited to a compound per se or the compound is recited as part of a combination or process, the members following "selected from the group consisting of" (or similar introductory phrase) need not share a community of properties themselves; the propriety of the grouping is determined by a consideration of the compound as a whole. See _Harnisch,_ 631 F.2d at 722, 206 USPQ at 305 ("in determining the propriety of a Markush grouping the compounds must be considered as wholes and not broken down into elements or other components"). See also _In re Jones,_ 162 F.2d 479, 481, 74 USPQ 149, 151 (CCPA 1947) ("In determining the propriety of a Markush grouping, moreover, the compounds which are grouped must each be considered as a whole and should not be broken down into elements or other components").

The alternatives defined by the Markush group are either alternative chemical compounds as a whole (e.g., if a claim includes a compound R-OH wherein R is selected from the group consisting of methyl, propyl, and butyl, then the alternatives are methanol, propanol, or butanol) or in the context of a combination or process, the alternatives from which a selection is to be made (e.g., the alternatives in a list following the phrase "selected from the group consisting of"). The alternatives (1) share a "single structural similarity" when they belong to the same recognized physical or chemical class or to the same art-recognized class, and (2) share a common function or use when they are disclosed in the specification or known in the art to be functionally equivalent in the context of the claimed invention. See _Supplementary Guidelines_ at 7166 and subsection II.A, below.

Where a Markush grouping describes alternative chemical compounds, whether by words or chemical formulas, and the compounds do not appear to be members of a recognized physical or chemical class or members of an art-recognized class, the members are considered to share a "single structural similarity" and common use when the alternatively usable compounds share a substantial structural feature that is essential to a common use. _Ex parte Hozumi,_ 3 USPQ2d 1059, 1060 (Bd. Pat. App. & Int. 1984). See also subsection II.B, below.

## A.    **_"Single Structural Similarity" - Members of a Physical, Chemical, or Art-Recognized Class_**

Members of a Markush group share a "single structural similarity" when they belong to the same recognized physical or chemical class or to the same art-recognized class. A recognized physical class, a recognized chemical class, or an art-recognized class is a class wherein there is an expectation from the knowledge in the art that members of the class will behave in the same way in the context of the claimed invention. In other words, each member could be substituted one for the other, with the expectation that the same intended result would be achieved. For example, in the context of a claim covering a disposable diaper, a limitation "the fastener selected from the group consisting of a pressure sensitive adhesive and complementary release material, a complementary hook and loop structure, a snap, and a buckle" would likely be considered an art recognized class because a review of the prior art would establish that it was well known that each member could be substituted for each other with the expectation that the intended result (repositionable and refastenable) would occur.

Note that where a Markush group includes only materials from a recognized scientific class of equivalent materials or from an art-recognized class, "the mere existence of such a group in an application tend[s] to prove the equivalence of its members and when one of them [is] anticipated the group [is] therefore rendered unpatentable, in the absence of some convincing evidence of some degree of non-equivalency of one or more of the remaining members." _In re Ruff,_ 256 F.2d 590, 598-99, 118 USPQ 340, 348 (CCPA 1958)("[A]ctual equivalence is not enough to justify refusal of a patent on one member of a group when another member is in the prior art. The equivalence must be disclosed in the prior art or be obvious within the terms of Section 103." Id. at 599, 118 USPQ at 348).

Thus, a Markush grouping is ordinarily proper if all the members of the group belong to a recognized class (whether physical, chemical, or art recognized) and are disclosed in the specification to possess at least one property in common which is mainly responsible for their function in the claimed invention, and it is clear from their very nature or from the prior art that all members possess this property. See also **[MPEP § 803.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e98237.html)**.

## B.    **_Common Use Flows From Substantial Structural Feature_**

Where a Markush grouping describes alternative chemical compounds, whether by words or chemical formulas, and the alternatives do not belong to a recognized class as explained in subsection II.A, above, the members of the Markush grouping may still be considered to be proper where the alternatives share a substantial structural feature that is essential to a common use.

For example, in _Harnisch_, the claims were directed to a Markush group of coumarin derivatives disclosed to be useful as dyes. The claimed coumarin derivatives were not members of a recognized chemical class, encompassing "polyfused N-heterocyclics, cyclic, acyclic and aromatic amines, aryloxyalkylamines, amides, sulfonamides, [and] phthalimides" among others. _Harnisch,_ 631 F.2d at 718, 206 USPQ at 302. Furthermore, they were not members of an art-recognized class ("[n]owhere in the record has it been established or even alleged that the variety of compounds included within the explicit scope of the claims are recognized by the art as being functionally equivalent" (_Id._)). However, the court found that the Markush grouping was proper because the claimed compounds, viewed as a whole, all share a coumarin group and the property of being a dye. See also _In re Jones,_ 162 F.2d 479, 481, 74 USPQ 149, 151 (1947).

See also _Ex parte Hozumi_, 3 USPQ2d 1059, 1060 (Bd. Pat. App. & Int. 1984)). See subsection IV, below, for a discussion of the _Harnisch_ and _Hozumi_ decisions.

## III.    **REJECTION BASED ON IMPROPER MARKUSH GROUPING**

When an examiner determines that the species of a Markush group do not share a single structural similarity or do not share a common use, then a rejection on the basis that the claim contains an ‘‘improper Markush grouping’’ is appropriate (see subsection II). Note that this is a rejection on the merits and may be appealed to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board in accordance with **[35 U.S.C. 134](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e303218912313.html)**  and **[37 CFR 41.31(a)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e356411.html##ar_d24d1f_19b20_1b6)**. Use Form Paragraph **[8.40](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//fp8.40.html)** to reject a claim on the basis that it includes an improper Markush grouping.

# ¶ 8.40    Improper Markush Grouping Rejection

Claim **[1]** rejected on the basis that it contains an improper Markush grouping of alternatives. See _In re Harnisch,_ 631 F.2d 716, 721-22 (CCPA 1980) and _Ex parte Hozumi,_ 3 USPQ2d 1059, 1060 (Bd. Pat. App. & Int. 1984). A Markush grouping is proper if the alternatives defined by the Markush group (i.e., alternatives from which a selection is to be made in the context of a combination or process, or alternative chemical compounds as a whole) share a "single structural similarity" and a common use. A Markush grouping meets these requirements in two situations. First, a Markush grouping is proper if the alternatives are all members of the same recognized physical or chemical class or the same art-recognized class, and are disclosed in the specification or known in the art to be functionally equivalent and have a common use. Second, where a Markush grouping describes alternative chemical compounds, whether by words or chemical formulas, and the alternatives do not belong to a recognized class as set forth above, the members of the Markush grouping may be considered to share a "single structural similarity" and common use where the alternatives share both a substantial structural feature and a common use that flows from the substantial structural feature. See **[MPEP § 2117](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d299b6_1ae8e_380.html)**.

The Markush grouping of **[2]** is improper because the alternatives defined by the Markush grouping do not share both a single structural similarity and a common use for the following reasons: **[3]**.

To overcome this rejection, Applicant may set forth each alternative (or grouping of patentably indistinct alternatives) within an improper Markush grouping in a series of independent or dependent claims and/or present convincing arguments that the group members recited in the alternative within a single claim in fact share a single structural similarity as well as a common use.

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 1, insert claim number(s) and "is" or "are" as appropriate.

2. In bracket 2, insert a description of the Markush group(s) that are improper.

3. In bracket 3, explain why these alternatives do not meet the requirements for a proper Markush grouping, i.e., why the alternatives are not all members of the same recognized physical or chemical class or the same art-recognized class; and/or why the members are not considered to be functionally equivalent and have a common use; and/or why (if the Markush grouping describes alternative chemical compounds), the alternatives do not share both a substantial structural feature and a common use that flows from the substantial structural feature. See **[MPEP § 2117](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d299b6_1ae8e_380.html)**.

4. If an election of species requirement is appropriate, this form paragraph should only be used after applicant has made an election.

In accordance with the principles of compact prosecution, a rejection based on an improper Markush grouping should be made in the first action on the merits after presentation of the claim with the improper Markush grouping (e.g., first Office action on the merits or next Office action following presentation of the claim). In addition, if the examiner determines that one or more claims include an improper Markush grouping, the examiner should also require the applicant to elect an alternative or group of indistinct alternatives for search and examination (i.e., an election of species), if such an election requirement was not previously made. See **[MPEP § 803.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e98237.html)** for more information on election of species requirements in Markush claims. Note that if a written provisional election of species requirement must be made separate from the first Office action on the merits, it should not include a rejection on the basis of an improper Markush grouping. Any appropriate improper Markush grouping rejection should be made in an Office action on the merits.

The examiner should include suggestions for the applicant as to how to overcome the rejection, e.g., by suggesting a proper Markush grouping based on the specification as filed and/or by suggesting that applicant set forth each alternative (or grouping of patentably indistinct alternatives) within an improper Markush grouping in a series of independent or dependent claims. There may be more than one way to formulate a proper Markush grouping. The examiner should not suggest any grouping that clearly would not meet the requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**. For example, the examiner should not suggest a grouping that meets the requirements for a proper Markush grouping, but would clearly lack adequate written description if presented in a separate claim.

In addition to a rejection based on an improper Markush grouping, the claim should also be rejected under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)**  if one skilled in the art cannot determine the metes and bounds of the Markush claim due to an inability to envision all of the members of the Markush grouping. In other words, if a boundary cannot be drawn separating embodiments encompassed by the claim from those that are not, the claim is indefinite and should be rejected under **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)**. See also **[MPEP § 2173.05(h)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e218467.html)**.

The claim should be examined for patentability with respect to all other conditions of patentability (e.g., **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**, **[102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//al_d1fbe1_234ed_52.html)**, **[103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//al_d1fbe1_19797_b0.html)**, **[112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824912.html)**, and nonstatutory double patenting). As explained with regard to election of species practice as set forth in detail in **[MPEP § 803.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e98237.html)**, the search need not be extended to species that fall outside a proper Markush grouping.

The improper Markush grouping rejection of the claim should be maintained until (1) the claim is amended such that the Markush grouping includes only members that share a single structural similarity and a common use; or (2) the applicant presents convincing arguments why the members of the Markush grouping share a single structural similarity and common use (i.e., are members of a physical, chemical, or art-recognized class that share a common use, or are chemical compounds that share a substantial structural feature that is essential to the common use). In addition, even if the applicant does not take action sufficient to overcome the improper Markush grouping rejection, when all of the claims are otherwise in condition for allowance the examiner should reconsider the propriety of the improper Markush grouping rejection. If the examiner determines that in light of the prior art and the record as a whole the alternatives of the Markush grouping share a single structural similarity and a common use, then the rejection should be withdrawn. Note that no Markush claim can be allowed until any improper Markush grouping rejection has been overcome or withdrawn, and all other conditions of patentability have been satisfied.

## IV.    **MARKUSH GROUPING EXAMPLES**

The propriety of Markush groupings must be decided on a case-by-case basis. The following examples illustrate Markush groupings that have been found to be proper and improper. Office personnel should note that the cases from which these examples are drawn have been selected for their treatment of Markush groupings. The cases may not necessarily reflect current practice as to other issues discussed therein.

## A.    **_In re Harnisch, 631 F.2d 716, 206 USPQ 300 (CCPA 1980)_**

_Representative Claim:_

1. Coumarin compounds which in one of their mesometric limiting structures correspond to the general formula

![diagram of general formula for a mesometric limiting structure](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/graphics/E9_R-01.2024/Harnisch-mesometric-limiting-structure.png "diagram of general formula for a mesometric limiting structure")

wherein

> - X represents aldehyde, azomethine, or hydrazone,
> - R1 represents hydrogen or alkyl,
> - Z1 represents hydrogen, alkyl, cycloalkyl, aralkyl, aryl or a 2- or 3-membered alkylene radical connected to the 6-position of the coumarin ring and
> - Z2 represents hydrogen, alkyl, cycloalkyl, aralkyl or a 2- or 3-membered alkylene radical connected to the 8-position of the coumarin ring

and wherein

> - Z1 and Z2 conjointly with the N atom by which they are bonded can represent the remaining members of an optionally benz-fused heterocyclic ring which, like the ring A and the alkyl, aralkyl, cycloalkyl and aryl radicals mentioned, can carry further radicals customary in dye-stuff chemistry.

_Background:_ The Board had entered a rejection – later reversed by the CCPA – of claim 1 under **[37 CFR 1.196(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e325097.html)**  on the ground that it was drawn to an improper Markush group. The Board had focused on the wide variety of functional groups that could be present in the claimed compounds, and had stressed the different physical and chemical properties of the compounds in view of the functional groups. The Board had observed that "[n]owhere in the record has it been established or even alleged that the variety of compounds included within the explicit scope of the claims are recognized by the art as being functionally equivalent." In the Board’s view, "the mere fact" that all of the compounds encompassed by claim 1 shared "a single structural similarity (i.e., the coumarin group)," and as a result were useful either as dyes or intermediates for the preparation of dyes, was insufficient to render the Markush grouping proper because the compounds could "be subject to different modes of application and use."

_Analysis/Conclusion:_ The CCPA reversed the Board’s decision and held that the Markush grouping was proper. The court pointed out that all of the claimed compounds are dyes, even if some might also be seen as synthetic intermediates. The court noted the Board’s admission, despite the significant variation in functional groups, that all of the compounds shared "a single structural similarity" which is the coumarin core. The court held that "the claimed compounds all belong to a subgenus, as defined by appellant [in the specification], which is not repugnant to scientific classification." Stating that "[u]nder these circumstances we consider the claimed compounds to be part of a single invention," the court concluded that the Markush grouping of claim 1 was proper. The CCPA also stressed that they decide cases involving the propriety of Markush groupings "on their facts on a case-by-case basis."

The _Harnisch_ court also cited its earlier decision in _In re Jones_, 162 F.2d 479, 74 USPQ 149 (CCPA 1947) with approval as to the proper approach to evaluating claims containing Markush groups. According to the _Harnisch_ court, "in determining the propriety of a Markush grouping the compounds must be considered as wholes and not broken down into elements or other components." In other words, when considering whether the members of a Markush group have sufficient structural similarity and common use to meet prongs 1 and 2 above, the proper focus should be on the commonality across all of the alternative embodiments of the invention within the scope of the claim. Note that in the _Harnisch_ decision, the court looked to the common structure of the coumarin core and its associated common function as a dye, even though the coumarin core was not part of the variable Markush groups of substituents. A Markush grouping is not improper simply because the members of a list of alternative elements or substituents of the invention, as distinguished from a list of complete embodiments of the invention, lack "a single structural similarity" or a common use. When assessing whether a Markush grouping defining a chemical compound is proper, each claimed chemical compound as a whole must be compared and analyzed to determine whether the claimed compounds share both a substantial single structural similarity and a common use.

## B.    **_Ex parte Dams, Appeal No. 1997-2193, 07/986,648, decision mailed 9-13-2000 (unpublished); USP 6,201,122_**

_Representative Claims:_

1. A fluoroaliphatic radical-containing anionic sulfonamido compound which comprises a fluoroaliphatic radical-containing sulfonamido group and an ethylenecarbonyl group whose beta ethylene carbon atom is bonded to a sulfur or nitrogen atom which is bonded to a linking group bonded to the nitrogen atom of said sulfonamido group, and the carbonyl carbon atom of said carbonyl is bonded to an anionic hydrophilic polar group comprising at least one carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur atom.

2. The fluoroaliphatic radical-containing sulfonamido compound of claim 1 wherein said compound has the formula

> - RfSO2N(R)WACH(R')CH(R'')C(O)-Y

where Rf is a fluoroaliphatic radical; A is S or NR'''; W is siloxylene, silylene, alkylene, arylene, or combinations thereof; R, R', R'', and R''' are independently hydrogen, lower alkyl, aryl, or combinations thereof, and can contain functional groups, or R and R''' together with the nitrogen atoms to which they are bonded and W, form a ring; and Y is an anionic hydrophilic polar group comprising at least one carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur atom.

6. The fluoroaliphatic radical-containing sulfonamido compound of claim 2 wherein said N(R)WA is selected from the group consisting of N(R)CH2CH2NH,

![graphic representation of cyclic alternative](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/graphics/E9_R-01.2024/Dams_N-N_figure.png "graphic representation of cyclic alternative")

N(R)CH2CH2CH2Si(CH3)2OSi(CH3)2CH2CH2CH2NH, N(R)CH(CH3)CH2(CH2CH2O)q(CH(CH3)CH2O)zCH2CH(CH3)NH where q and z are from 1 to 20, and N(R)CH2CH2S, where R is H, CH3 or CH2CH3.

_Background:_ The examiner had rejected the claims on a number of grounds, including the ground of improper Markush groupings. It had been the examiner’s position that the Markush groups of the claims lacked a common structural feature. The examiner had also stated that in his view, the members of the Markush group were separately classifiable and separately patentable. This rejection was later reversed by the Board.

_Analysis/Conclusion:_ The Board stated that the examiner erred by failing to treat the compounds of the claims as a whole. The examiner had improperly "focused on the individual moiety defined by the Markush terminology." Referring to claim 6 and relying on _In re Harnisch_, the Board explained that even though Markush terminology was used to define the substituent N(R)WA, the proper inquiry was "whether the compounds defined by the different moieties" have the necessary common structure and common use. The Board held that the compounds shared "a common structural feature disclosed as essential to the disclosed utility of being an anionic surfactant." Thus the compounds satisfied prongs 1 and 2 above, and the Markush grouping was proper.

## C.    **_Ex parte Hozumi, 3 USPQ2d 1059 (Bd. Pat. App. & Interf. 1984) Appeal No. 559-94, Application No. 06/257,771, decision mailed 06-26-1984 (USP 4,551,532)_**

_Representative Claim:_

Claim 1. A compound of the formula:

![Formula for Claim 1 of Hozumi](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/graphics/E9_R-01.2024/Hozumi_Claim_1_Compound.png "Formula for Claim 1 of Hozumi")

> - wherein
>     - n is an integer of 1 to 15;
>     - R1 is C6-26 alkyl, C6-26 alkenyl or C6-26 alkynyl, each of said groups being unsubstituted or substituted by hydroxyl, mercapto, amino, oxo, carbamoyl, carboxyl, halogen, C3-7 cycloalkyl or phenyl; and
>     - R2 , R3 and R4 are independently hydrogen or C1-5 alkyl, or
>         
>         ![graphic representation of cyclic ammonio group](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/graphics/E9_R-01.2024/Hozumi_ammonio_group.png "graphic representation of cyclic ammonio group")
>         
>         represents cyclic ammonio selected from the group consisting of pyridinio, oxazolio, thiazolio, pyridazinio, quinolinio, isoquinolinio, N-C1-4 alkylmorpholinio and N-C1-4 alkylpiperazinio, each of said groups being unsubstituted or substituted by C1-4 alkyl, hydroxyl, hydroxyethyl, aminoethyl, amino, carbamoyl or ureido,
>         
> 
> or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.

_Background:_ The examiner had rejected claim 1 on the ground that it included an improper Markush grouping.

_Analysis/Conclusion:_ The Board reversed the examiner’s improper Markush grouping rejection of claim 1, once again relying on the _Harnisch_ decision. The Board summarized _Harnisch_ by stating that the Markush grouping of coumarin compounds in that case was proper because there was "in common a functional utility related to a substantial structural feature disclosed as being essential to that utility." In this case, as in others already discussed, the Board emphasized the case-by-case nature of the inquiry.

Applying the _Harnisch_ criteria to the facts of this case, the Board pointed out that structurally "the compounds claimed are phosphoric acid diesters in which one esterifying moiety is derived from a poly(ethylene glycol) monoether and the other is derived from a beta-aminoethanol." The Board acknowledged that as a result of the variable number of repeating oxyethylene units indicated by the "n" index, the molecular weight could "vary over a fairly broad range," and that further structural variation was seen in the etherifying groups and the substituents on the nitrogen atom. Despite the breadth of the claim, the Board focused on "the relatively large proportion of the structure of the compounds in the claimed class which is common to the entire class," and determined that the prong 1 requirement for structural similarity was met. As for the prong 2 common use requirement, the Board stated that all of the compounds shared antimycotic activity. Thus the Board found that in this case, as was also the case in _Harnisch_, there was "a substantial structural feature of the class of compounds claimed disclosed as being essential to at least one disclosed utility." Thus the Markush grouping was proper and the examiner’s rejection was reversed.

## D.    **_Based On PCT International Search and Preliminary Examination Guidelines Example 33_**

Claim 1: A herbicidal composition consisting essentially of an effective amount of the mixture of (a) 2,4-D (2,4-dichloro-phenoxy acetic acid) and (b) a second herbicide selected from the group consisting of copper sulfate, sodium chlorate, ammonium sulfamate, sodium trichloroacetate, dichloropropionic acid, 3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid, diphenamid (an amide), ioxynil (nitrile), dinoseb (phenol), trifluralin (dinitroaniline), EPTC (thiocarbamate), and simazine (triazine) along with an inert carrier or diluent.

_Background/Prior Art:_ A review of the art demonstrates that the alternatives are not all members of the same recognized physical or chemical recognized class of compounds. The prior art explains that mixing herbicides can be risky and can result in physical or chemical incompatibilities, e.g., increasing or decreasing the effectiveness of each or all of the herbicides, increasing toxicity, or reacting to form a precipitate. The prior art also shows that the many of the herbicides set forth in component (b) are effective against one type of weed (e.g., algae, woody weeds, or grasses), but are not effective against other types of weeds. In addition, many of the herbicides listed in the Markush group are tolerated by one type of crop (e.g., legumes, tomato, or corn) or in one type of environment (e.g., ponds, golf courses, or orchards), but are not tolerated by other crops or in other environments.

_Analysis:_ All members of the Markush grouping have a common disclosed use as herbicides. However, the alternatives set forth in the Markush grouping are not all members of the same physical or chemical recognized class of compounds. Furthermore, the members of the Markush group defining component (b) are not in an art recognized class because a person of ordinary skill in the art would not expect that members of the class will behave in the same way in the context of the claimed invention. Specifically, a person of ordinary skill in the art would not expect that any one herbicide of component (b) could be substituted with any other member of the Markush group with the expectation that the same intended result would be achieved because of the unpredictability of results when mixing herbicides, the different weeds that are controlled by one member of the Markush group as compared to another, the different crops that do (or do not) tolerate the alternatives within the Markush group, and the different environments in which the each second herbicide is suitable for use.

Although the members of the Markush grouping are not members of a recognized class (physical, chemical, or art-recognized) for the reasons set forth above, the Markush grouping describes alternative chemical compounds. Therefore, the members of the Markush grouping may be considered to share a "single structural similarity" and common use if the alternatives share both a substantial structural feature and a common use that flows from the substantial structural feature.

In this case, the members of the Markush grouping do not share a substantial structural feature. Rather, the members of the Markush group defining component (b) represent a plurality of chemical classes with varying structures which may be identified as follows:

- (a) inorganic salts: copper sulfate, sodium chlorate, ammonium sulfamate (no ring structure)
- (b) organic salts and carboxylic acids: sodium trichloroacetate, dichloropropionic acid, 3-amino-2,5-dichlorobenzoic acid (only the third chemical has a ring structure, which is a benzoic acid)
- (c) amides: diphenamid (ring structure is diphenyl)
- (d) nitriles: ioxynil (ring structure is dinitrophenol)
- (e) phenols: dinoseb
- (f) amines: trifluralin, (ring structure is dinitroaniline), and
- (g) heterocyclic: simazine (ring structure is triazine).

_Conclusion:_ The claim sets forth an improper Markush grouping because the alternatives are not all members of the same recognized physical or chemical class or the same art-recognized class, nor do the alternative chemical compounds share both a substantial structural feature and a common use that flows from the substantial structural feature.

## I.    **CHOICE OF PRIOR ART; BEST AVAILABLE**

Prior art rejections should ordinarily be confined strictly to the best available art. Exceptions may properly be made, for example, where:

- (A) the propriety of a **[35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302383.html)**  or **[103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//al_d1fbe1_19797_b0.html)**  rejection depends on a particular interpretation of a claim;
- (B) a claim is met by a prior art disclosure which does not disclose the inventive concept involved;
- (C) for cases examined under the first inventor to file provisions of the AIA, the most pertinent disclosure could be shown not to be prior art by invoking an exception in a **[37 CFR 1.130](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e323465.html)**  affidavit or declaration of attribution or prior public disclosure;
- (D) for cases examined under pre-AIA law, an obviousness rejection is based on prior art that qualifies only under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(e), (f), or (g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302383.html##d0e302407)**  so that the rejection could be overcome by establishing that the prior art is disqualified under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 103(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302450.html##d0e302521)**; or
- (E) for cases examined under pre-AIA law, the most pertinent disclosure could be antedated by a **[37 CFR 1.131](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//aia_d0e323504.html)**  affidavit or declaration of prior invention.

In the interest of compact prosecution, such rejections should be backed up by the best other art rejections available. Keep in mind the best backup rejection(s) could be based on alternate embodiments from the same "best available" reference(s). For example, if an anticipation rejection could be overcome by invoking an exception in a **[37 CFR 1.130(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e323465.html##d0e323497)**  declaration, it would be appropriate to make an additional obviousness rejection over another disclosure in the same reference. Merely cumulative rejections, i.e., those which would clearly fall if the primary rejection were not sustained, should be avoided.

See also **[MPEP § 707.05](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e73405.html)**.

## II.    **RELIANCE UPON ABSTRACTS AND FOREIGN LANGUAGE DOCUMENTS IN SUPPORT OF A REJECTION**

Prior art uncovered in searching the claimed subject matter of a patent application often includes English language abstracts of underlying documents, such as technical literature or foreign patent documents which may not be in the English language. When both the abstract and the underlying document qualify as prior art, the underlying document should normally be used to support a rejection. When an abstract is used to support a rejection, the evidence relied upon is the facts contained in the abstract, not additional facts that may be contained in the underlying full text document. Citation of and reliance upon an abstract without citation of and reliance upon the underlying scientific document is generally inappropriate where both the abstract and the underlying document are prior art. See _Ex parte Jones_, 62 USPQ2d 1206, 1208 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 2001) (unpublished). To determine whether both the abstract and the underlying document are prior art, a copy of the underlying document must be obtained and analyzed. If the document is in a language other than English and the examiner seeks to rely on that document, a translation must be obtained so that the record is clear as to the precise facts the examiner is relying upon in support of the rejection. The record must also be clear as to whether the examiner is relying upon the abstract or the full text document to support a rejection. The rationale for this is several-fold. It is not uncommon for a full text document to reveal that the document fully anticipates an invention that the abstract renders obvious at best. The converse may also be true, that the full text document will include teachings away from the invention that will preclude an obviousness rejection under **[35 U.S.C. 103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302450.html)**, when the abstract alone appears to support the rejection. An abstract can have a different publication date than the full text document. Because all patentability determinations are fact dependent, obtaining and considering full text documents at the earliest practicable time in the examination process will yield the fullest available set of facts upon which to determine patentability, thereby improving quality and reducing pendency. In limited circumstances, it may be appropriate for the examiner to make a rejection in a non-final Office action based in whole or in part on the abstract only without relying on the full text document. In such circumstances, the full text document and a translation (if not in English) may be supplied in the next Office action.

Examiners may rely on a machine translation of a foreign language document unless the machine translation is not of sufficient quality to be adequate evidence of the contents of the document. See _In re Orbital Technologies Corporation,_ 603 Fed. App’x 924, 932 (Fed. Cir. 2015). A request by the applicant for the examiner to obtain a human language translation should be granted if the applicant provides evidence (e.g., a translation inconsistent with the machine translation) showing the machine translation does not accurately represent the document’s contents.

An Office action supplying a full text document and/or translation may be made final if the conditions described in **[MPEP § 706.07(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e69118.html)** or for a first Office action or RCE, in **[MPEP § 706.07(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e69408.html)**, have been met.

Some translation resources available to examiners are discussed in **[MPEP § 901.05(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e113207.html)**.

## III.    **DISTINCTION BETWEEN 35 U.S.C. 102 AND 103**

The distinction between rejections based on **[35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302383.html)**  and those based on **[35 U.S.C. 103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302450.html)**  should be kept in mind. Under the former, the claim is anticipated by the reference. No question of obviousness is present. In other words, for anticipation under **[35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302383.html)**, the reference must teach every aspect of the claimed invention either explicitly or impliedly. Any feature not directly taught must be inherently present. Whereas, in a rejection based on **[35 U.S.C. 103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302450.html)**, the reference teachings must somehow be modified in order to meet the claims. The modification must be one which would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art before the effective filing date of the claimed invention for applications or patents subject to the first inventor to file provisions of the AIA or at the time the invention was made for applications or patents subject to pre-AIA law.

# 2121    Prior Art; General Level of Operability Required to Make a _Prima Facie_ Case [R-01.2024]

## I.    **PRIOR ART IS PRESUMED TO BE OPERABLE/ENABLING**

When the reference relied on expressly anticipates or makes obvious all of the elements of the claimed invention, the reference is presumed to be operable. Once such a reference is found, the burden is on applicant to rebut the presumption of operability. _In re Sasse,_ 629 F.2d 675, 207 USPQ 107 (CCPA 1980). See also **[MPEP § 716.07](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e93668.html)**. See also _In re Antor Media Corp.,_ 689 F.3d 1282, 103 USPQ2d 1555 (Fed. Cir. 2012). Specifically, in _In re Antor Media Corp.,_ the court stated:

> "Consistent with the statutory framework and our precedent, we therefore hold that, during patent prosecution, an examiner is entitled to reject claims as anticipated by a prior art publication or patent without conducting an inquiry into whether or not that prior art reference is enabling. As long as an examiner makes a proper prima facie case of anticipation by giving adequate notice under **[§ 132](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e303187.html)**, the burden shifts to the applicant to submit rebuttal evidence of nonenablement."

_In re Antor Media Corp.,_ 689 F.3d at 1289, 103 USPQ2d at 1559.

Where a reference appears to not be enabling on its face, however, an applicant may successfully challenge the cited prior art for lack of enablement by argument without supporting evidence. _In re Morsa,_ 713 F.3d 104, 110, 106 USPQ2d 1327, 1332 (Fed. Cir. 2013).

See also **[MPEP § 716.07](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e93668.html)**.

## II.    **WHAT CONSTITUTES AN "ENABLING DISCLOSURE" DOES NOT DEPEND ON THE TYPE OF PRIOR ART THE DISCLOSURE IS CONTAINED IN**

The level of disclosure required within a reference to make it an "enabling disclosure" is the same no matter what type of prior art is at issue. It does not matter whether the prior art reference is a U.S. patent, foreign patent, a printed publication or other. There is no basis in the statute (**[35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302383.html)**  or **[103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302450.html)** ) for discriminating either in favor of or against prior art references on the basis of nationality. _In re Moreton,_ 288 F.2d 708, 129 USPQ 227 (CCPA 1961).

## III.    **EFFICACY IS NOT A REQUIREMENT FOR PRIOR ART ENABLEMENT**

A prior art reference provides an enabling disclosure and thus anticipates a claimed invention if the reference describes the claimed invention in sufficient detail to enable a person of ordinary skill in the art to carry out the claimed invention; "proof of efficacy is not required for a prior art reference to be enabling for purposes of anticipation." _Impax Labs. Inc. v. Aventis Pharm._ _Inc.,_ 468 F.3d 1366, 1383, 81 USPQ2d 1001, 1013 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (citing _Rasmusson v. SmithKline Beecham Corp.,_ 413 F.3d 1318, 1326, 75 USPQ2d 1297, 1302 (Fed. Cir. 2005)). See also **[MPEP § 2122](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e201997.html)**.

# 2121.01    Use of Prior Art in Rejections Where Operability is in Question [R-07.2022]

"In determining that quantum of prior art disclosure which is necessary to declare an ... invention ‘not novel’ or ‘anticipated’ within **[section 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//al_d1fbe1_234ed_52.html)**, the stated test is whether a reference contains an ‘enabling disclosure’... ." _In re_ _Hoeksema,_ 399 F.2d 269, 158 USPQ 596 (CCPA 1968). The disclosure in an assertedly anticipating reference must provide an enabling disclosure of the desired subject matter; mere naming or description of the subject matter is insufficient, if it cannot be produced without undue experimentation. _Elan Pharm., Inc. v. Mayo Found. For Med. Educ. & Research,_ 346 F.3d 1051, 1054, 68 USPQ2d 1373, 1376 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (At issue was whether a prior art reference enabled one of ordinary skill in the art to produce Elan’s claimed transgenic mouse without undue experimentation. Without a disclosure enabling one skilled in the art to produce a transgenic mouse without undue experimentation, the reference would not be applicable as prior art.). A reference contains an "enabling disclosure" if the public was in possession of the claimed invention before the effective filing date of the claimed invention for applications or patents subject to the first inventor to file provisions of the AIA or at the time the invention was made for applications or patents subject to pre-AIA law. "Such possession is effected if one of ordinary skill in the art could have combined the publication’s description of the invention with his [or her] own knowledge to make the claimed invention." _In re Donohue,_ 766 F.2d 531, 226 USPQ 619 (Fed. Cir. 1985).

It is possible to make a **[35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302383.html)**  rejection even if the reference does not itself teach one of ordinary skill how to practice the invention, i.e., how to make the article disclosed or use the method disclosed. If the reference teaches every claimed element of the article or every claimed step of the method, secondary evidence, such as other patents or publications, can be cited to show public possession of the method of making the article or using the method. _In re Donohue,_ 766 F.2d at 533, 226 USPQ at 621. See **[MPEP § 2131.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e203057.html)** for more information on **[35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302383.html)**  rejections using secondary references to show that the primary reference contains an "enabling disclosure."

## II.    **35 U.S.C. 103 REJECTIONS AND USE OF INOPERATIVE PRIOR ART**

"Even if a reference discloses an inoperative device, it is prior art for all that it teaches." _Beckman Instruments_ _v._ _LKB Produkter AB,_ 892 F.2d 1547, 1551, 13 USPQ2d 1301, 1304 (Fed. Cir. 1989). Therefore, "a non-enabling reference may qualify as prior art for the purpose of determining obviousness under **[35 U.S.C. 103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302450.html)**." _Symbol Techs. Inc. v. Opticon Inc.,_ 935 F.2d 1569, 1578, 19 USPQ2d 1241, 1247 (Fed. Cir. 1991).

_[Editor Note: This MPEP section is applicable regardless of whether an application is examined under the AIA or under pre-AIA law. For applications subject to the first inventor to file (FITF) provisions of the AIA, the relevant time is "before the effective filing date of the claimed invention". For applications subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302383.html)**, the relevant time is "at the time of the invention". See **[MPEP § 2150](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d2002f_22805_16e.html)** et seq. Many of the court decisions discussed in this section involved applications or patents subject to **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302383.html)**. These court decisions may be applicable to applications and patents subject to **[AIA 35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//al_d1fbe1_234ed_52.html)**  but the relevant time is before the effective filing date of the claimed invention and not at the time of the invention.]_

## I.    **ONE OF ORDINARY SKILL IN THE ART MUST BE ABLE TO MAKE OR SYNTHESIZE**

Where a process for making the compound is not developed until after the date of invention, the mere naming of a compound in a reference, without more, cannot constitute a description of the compound. _In re Hoeksema,_ 399 F.2d 269, 158 USPQ 596 (CCPA 1968). Note, however, that a reference is presumed operable until applicant provides facts rebutting the presumption of operability. _In re Sasse,_ 629 F.2d 675, 207 USPQ 107 (CCPA 1980). Therefore, applicant must provide evidence showing that a process for making was not known at the relevant time. See the following subsection for the evidentiary standard to be applied.

## II.    **A REFERENCE DOES NOT CONTAIN AN "ENABLING DISCLOSURE" IF ATTEMPTS AT MAKING THE COMPOUND OR COMPOSITION WERE UNSUCCESSFUL BEFORE THE RELEVANT TIME**

When a prior art reference merely discloses the structure of the claimed compound, evidence showing that attempts to prepare that compound were unsuccessful before the relevant time will be adequate to show inoperability. _In re Wiggins,_ 488 F.2d 538, 179 USPQ 421 (CCPA 1973). However, the fact that an author of a publication did not attempt to make the compound disclosed, without more, will not overcome a rejection based on that publication. _In re Donohue,_ 766 F.2d 531, 226 USPQ 619 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (In this case, the examiner had made a rejection under **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302383.html)**  over a publication, which disclosed the claimed compound, in combination with two patents teaching a general process of making the particular class of compounds. The applicant submitted an affidavit stating that the authors of the publication had not actually synthesized the compound. The court held that the fact that the publication’s author did not synthesize the disclosed compound was immaterial to the question of reference operability. The patents were evidence that synthesis methods were well known. The court distinguished _Wiggins,_ in which a very similar rejection was reversed. In _Wiggins,_ attempts to make the compounds using the prior art methods were all unsuccessful.). Compare _In re Hoeksema,_ 399 F.2d 269, 158 USPQ 596 (CCPA 1968) (A claim to a compound was rejected over a patent to _De Boer_ which disclosed compounds similar in structure to those claimed (obvious homologs) and a process of making these compounds. Applicant responded with an affidavit by an expert named Wiley which stated that there was no indication in the _De Boer_ patent that the process disclosed in _De Boer_ could be used to produce the claimed compound and that he did not believe that the process disclosed in _De Boer_ could be adapted to the production of the claimed compound. The court held that the facts stated in this affidavit were legally sufficient to overcome the rejection and that applicant need not show that all known processes are incapable of producing the claimed compound for this showing would be practically impossible.).

# 2121.03    Plant Genetics — What Constitutes Enabling Prior Art [R-01.2024]

##    **THOSE OF ORDINARY SKILL MUST BE ABLE TO GROW AND CULTIVATE THE PLANT**

When the claims are drawn to plants, the reference, combined with knowledge in the prior art, must enable one of ordinary skill in the art to reproduce the plant. _In re_ _LeGrice,_ 301 F.2d 929, 133 USPQ 365 (CCPA 1962) (National Rose Society Annual of England and various other catalogues showed color pictures of the claimed roses and disclosed that applicant had raised the roses. The publications were published more than 1 year before applicant's filing date. The court held that the publications did not place the rose in the public domain. Information on the grafting process required to reproduce the rose was not included in the publications and such information was necessary for those of ordinary skill in the art (plant breeders) to reproduce the rose.). Compare _Ex parte_ _Thomson,_ 24 USPQ2d 1618 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1992) (Seeds were commercially available more than 1 year prior to applicant’s filing date. One of ordinary skill in the art could grow the claimed cotton cultivar from the commercially available seeds. Thus, the publications describing the cotton cultivar had "enabled disclosures." The Board distinguished _In re LeGrice_ by finding that the catalogue picture of the rose of _In re LeGrice_ was the only evidence in that case. There was no evidence of commercial availability in enabling form since the asexually reproduced rose could not be reproduced from seed. Therefore, the public would not have possession of the rose by its picture alone, but the public would have possession of the cotton cultivar based on the publications and the availability of the seeds.). In _In re Elsner,_ 381 F.3d 1125, 1126, 72 USPQ2d 1038, 1040 (Fed. Cir. 2004), prior to the critical date of a plant patent application, the plant had been sold in Germany and a foreign Plant Breeder’s Rights (PBR) application for the same plant had been published in the Community Plant Variety Office _Official Gazette_. The court held that when (i) a publication identifies the plant, (ii) a foreign sale occurs that puts one of ordinary skill in the art in possession of the plant itself, and (iii) such possession permits asexual reproduction of the plant without undue experimentation by one of ordinary skill in the art, then that combination of facts and events directly conveys the essential knowledge of the invention and constitutes a **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 102(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302383.html##d0e302395)**  statutory bar._Id._ at 1129, 72 USPQ2d at 1041. Although the court agreed with the Board that foreign sales may enable an otherwise non-enabling printed publication, the case was remanded for additional fact-finding in order to determine if the foreign sales of the plant were known to be accessible to the skilled artisan and if the skilled artisan could have reproduced the plant asexually after obtaining it without undue experimentation. _Id._ at 1131, 72 USPQ2d at 1043. See **[MPEP § 2152.02(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d20033_2254b_3e0.html)** for information on foreign sales being prior art for applications subject to the first inventor to file provisions of the AIA.

# 2121.04    Apparatus and Articles — What Constitutes Enabling Prior Art [R-10.2019]

##    **PICTURES MAY CONSTITUTE AN "ENABLING DISCLOSURE"**

Pictures and drawings may be sufficiently enabling to put the public in the possession of the article pictured. Therefore, such an enabling picture may be used to reject claims to the article. However, the picture must show all the claimed structural features and how they are put together. _In re Bager,_ 47 F.2d 951, 953, 8 USPQ 484, 486 (CCPA 1931) ("Description for the purposes of anticipation can be by drawings alone as well as by words.") (citing _Jockmus v. Leviton,_ 28 F.2d 812 (2d Cir. 1928)). See also **[MPEP § 2125](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e202147.html)** for a discussion of drawings as prior art.

# 2122    Discussion of Utility in the Prior Art [R-01.2024]

##    **UTILITY NEED NOT BE DISCLOSED IN REFERENCE**

In order to constitute anticipatory prior art, a reference must identically disclose the claimed compound, but no utility need be disclosed by the reference. _In re_ _Schoenwald,_ 964 F.2d 1122, 1124, 22 USPQ2d 1671, 1673 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (The application claimed compounds used in ophthalmic compositions to treat dry eye syndrome. The examiner found a printed publication which disclosed the claimed compound but did not disclose a use for the compound. The court found that the claim was anticipated since the compound and a process of making it were taught by the reference. The court explained that "no utility need be disclosed for a reference to be anticipatory of a claim to an old compound." It is enough that the claimed compound is taught by the reference.). See also _Impax Labs. Inc. v. Aventis Pharm. Inc.,_ 468 F.3d 1366, 1383, 81 USPQ2d 1001, 1013 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (citing _Rasmusson v. SmithKline Beecham Corp.,_ 413 F.3d 1318, 1326, 75 USPQ2d 1297, 1302 (Fed. Cir. 2005)); ("[P]roof of efficacy is not required for a prior art reference to be enabling for purposes of anticipation.").

# 2123    Rejection Over Prior Art’s Broad Disclosure Instead of Preferred Embodiments [R-07.2022]

## I.    **PATENTS ARE RELEVANT AS PRIOR ART FOR ALL THEY CONTAIN**

"The use of patents as references is not limited to what the patentees describe as their own inventions or to the problems with which they are concerned. They are part of the literature of the art, relevant for all they contain." _In re Heck,_ 699 F.2d 1331, 1332-33, 216 USPQ 1038, 1039 (Fed. Cir. 1983) (quoting _In re Lemelson,_ 397 F.2d 1006, 1009, 158 USPQ 275, 277 (CCPA 1968)).

A reference may be relied upon for all that it would have reasonably suggested to one having ordinary skill in the art, including nonpreferred embodiments. _Merck & Co. v._ _Biocraft Labs., Inc._ 874 F.2d 804, 10 USPQ2d 1843 (Fed. Cir. 1989), _cert. denied,_ 493 U.S. 975 (1989). See also _Upsher-Smith Labs. v. Pamlab, LLC,_ 412 F.3d 1319, 1323, 75 USPQ2d 1213, 1215 (Fed. Cir. 2005) (reference disclosing optional inclusion of a particular component teaches compositions that both do and do not contain that component); _Celeritas Technologies Ltd. v. Rockwell International Corp.,_ 150 F.3d 1354, 1361, 47 USPQ2d 1516, 1522-23 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (The court held that the prior art anticipated the claims even though it taught away from the claimed invention. "The fact that a modem with a single carrier data signal is shown to be less than optimal does not vitiate the fact that it is disclosed.").

See also **[MPEP § 2131.05](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e203351.html)** and **[§ 2145](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e212553.html)**, subsection X.D., which discuss prior art that teaches away from the claimed invention in the context of anticipation and obviousness, respectively.

## II.    **NONPREFERRED AND ALTERNATIVE EMBODIMENTS CONSTITUTE PRIOR ART**

Disclosed examples and preferred embodiments do not constitute a teaching away from a broader disclosure or nonpreferred embodiments. _In re Susi,_ 440 F.2d 442, 169 USPQ 423 (CCPA 1971). "A known or obvious composition does not become patentable simply because it has been described as somewhat inferior to some other product for the same use." _In re Gurley,_ 27 F.3d 551, 554, 31 USPQ2d 1130, 1132 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (The invention was directed to an epoxy impregnated fiber-reinforced printed circuit material. The applied prior art reference taught a printed circuit material similar to that of the claims but impregnated with polyester-imide resin instead of epoxy. The reference, however, disclosed that epoxy was known for this use, but that epoxy impregnated circuit boards have "relatively acceptable dimensional stability" and "some degree of flexibility," but are inferior to circuit boards impregnated with polyester-imide resins. The court upheld the rejection concluding that applicant’s argument that the reference teaches away from using epoxy was insufficient to overcome the rejection since "Gurley asserted no discovery beyond what was known in the art." _Id._ at 554, 31 USPQ2d at 1132.). Furthermore, "[t]he prior art’s mere disclosure of more than one alternative does not constitute a teaching away from any of these alternatives because such disclosure does not criticize, discredit, or otherwise discourage the solution claimed…." _In re Fulton,_ 391 F.3d 1195, 1201, 73 USPQ2d 1141, 1146 (Fed. Cir. 2004).

# 2124    Exception to the Rule That the Reference Must be Prior Art [R-01.2024]

##    **IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES A FACTUAL REFERENCE NEED NOT ANTEDATE THE FILING DATE**

In certain circumstances, references cited to show a universal fact need not be available as prior art before the effective filing date of applicant’s claimed invention. _In re Wilson,_ 311 F.2d 266, 135 USPQ 442 (CCPA 1962). Such facts include the characteristics and properties of a material or a scientific truism. Some specific examples in which later publications showing factual evidence can be cited include situations where the facts shown in the reference are evidence "that, as of an application’s filing date, undue experimentation would have been required, _In re Corneil,_ 347 F.2d 563, 568, 145 USPQ 702, 705 (CCPA 1965), or that a parameter absent from the claims was or was not critical, _In re Rainer,_ 305 F.2d 505, 507 n.3, 134 USPQ 343, 345 n.3 (CCPA 1962), or that a statement in the specification was inaccurate, _In re Marzocchi,_ 439 F.2d 220, 223 n.4, 169 USPQ 367, 370 n.4 (CCPA 1971), or that the invention was inoperative or lacked utility, _In re Langer,_ 503 F.2d 1380, 1391, 183 USPQ 288, 297 (CCPA 1974), or that a claim was indefinite, _In re Glass,_ 492 F.2d 1228,1232 n.6, 181 USPQ 31, 34 n.6 (CCPA 1974), or that characteristics of prior art products were known, _In re Wilson,_ 311 F.2d 266, 135 USPQ 442 (CCPA 1962)." _In re Koller,_ 613 F.2d 819, 824 n.5, 204 USPQ 702, 706 n.5 (CCPA 1980) (quoting _In re Hogan,_ 559 F.2d 595, 605 n.17, 194 USPQ 527, 537 n.17 (CCPA 1977) (emphasis in original)). See also _Amgen Inc. v. Sanofi,_ 872 F.3d 1367, 1375, 124 USPQ2d 1354, 1359 (Fed. Cir. 2017)(post-effective-filing-date evidence could be relied upon to show that patent failed to disclose a representative number of species of a claimed genus, and to show that patentees may have engaged in undue experimentation to enable the full scope of the claims before the effective filing date). However, it is impermissible to use a later factual reference showing the state of the art existing after the effective filing date of the claimed invention to determine whether the application is enabled or described as required under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824.html)**, first paragraph. _In re Koller,_ 613 F.2d 819, 823 n. 5, 204 USPQ 702, 706 n.5 (CCPA 1980). Post-effective-filing-date evidence offered to illuminate the post-effective-filing-date state of the art is improper. _Amgen,_ 872 F.3d at 1374, 124 USPQ2d at 1359. References which do not qualify as prior art because they postdate the claimed invention may be relied upon to show the level of ordinary skill in the art at or around the relevant time. See _Ex parte Erlich,_ 22 USPQ2d 1463 (Bd. Pat. App. & Inter. 1992).

## I.    **OVERVIEW**

**[The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA), Public Law 112-29, sec. 14](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//aiasec14taxstrategy.html)**, 125 Stat. 284 (September 16, 2011) provides that for purposes of evaluating an invention for novelty and nonobviousness under **[35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302383.html)**  and **[35 U.S.C. 103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302450.html)**, any strategy for reducing, avoiding, or deferring tax liability (hereinafter "tax strategy"), whether known or unknown at the relevant time, shall be deemed insufficient to differentiate a claimed invention from the prior art. As a result, applicants will no longer be able to rely on the novelty or non-obviousness of a tax strategy embodied in their claims to distinguish them from the prior art. Any tax strategy will be considered indistinguishable from all other publicly available information that is relevant to a patent’s claim of originality. This provision aims to keep the ability to interpret the tax law and to implement such interpretation in the public domain, available to all taxpayers and their advisors.

The term "tax liability" is defined for purposes of this provision as referring to any liability for a tax under any federal, state, or local law, or the law of any foreign jurisdiction, including any statute, rule, regulation, or ordinance that levies, imposes, or assesses such tax liability.

There are two exclusions to this provision. The first is that the provision does not apply to that part of an invention that is a method, apparatus, technology, computer program product, or system, that is used solely for preparing a tax or information return or other tax filing, including one that records, transmits, transfers, or organizes data related to such filing.

The second is that the provision does not apply to that part of an invention that is a method, apparatus, technology, computer program product, or system, that is used solely for financial management, to the extent that it is severable from any tax strategy or does not limit the use of any tax strategy by any taxpayer or tax advisor.

This provision took effect on September 16, 2011, and applies to any patent application that is pending on, or filed on or after, September 16, 2011, and to any patent issued on or after September 16, 2011. Accordingly, this provision will apply in a reexamination or other post-grant proceeding only to patents issued on or after September 16, 2011.

## II.    **EXAMINATION GUIDANCE FOR CLAIMS RELATING TO TAX STRATEGIES**

The following procedure should be followed when examining claims relating to tax strategies.

- 1. Construe the claim in accordance with **[MPEP § 2111](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e200352.html)** _et seq._
- 2. Analyze the claim for compliance with **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302376.html)**  and **[112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302824.html)**  in accordance with current guidance, which is unaffected by this provision.
- 3. Identify any limitations relating to a tax strategy, as defined above (note the listed exclusions).
    - a. Inventions that fall within the scope of **[AIA section 14](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//aiasec14taxstrategy.html)**  include those tax strategies especially suitable for use with tax-favored structures that must meet certain requirements, such as employee benefit plans, tax-exempt organizations, or other entities that must be structured or operated in a particular manner to obtain certain tax consequences.
    - b. Thus, **[AIA section 14](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//aiasec14taxstrategy.html)**  applies if the effect of an invention is to aid in satisfying the qualification requirements for a desired tax-favored entity status, to take advantage of the specific tax benefits offered in a tax-favored structure, or to allow for tax reduction, avoidance, or deferral not otherwise automatically available in such entity or structure.
- 4. Evaluate the claim in view of the prior art under **[35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302383.html)**  and **[103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302450.html)**, treating any limitations relating to a tax strategy as being within the prior art, and not as a patentable difference between the claim and the prior art. This approach is analogous to the treatment of printed matter limitations in a claim as discussed at **[MPEP § 2112.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e201273.html)**, subsection III.

Form paragraph **[7.06.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//fp7.06.01.html)** may be used to indicate claim limitation(s) interpreted as a tax strategy.

# ¶ 7.06.01    Claim Limitation Relating to a Tax Strategy Deemed To Be Within the Prior Art under 35 U.S.C. 102 and/or 103

Claim limitation "**[1]**" has been interpreted as a strategy for reducing, avoiding, or deferring tax liability ("tax strategy") pursuant to Section 14 of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act. Accordingly, this claim limitation is being treated as being within the prior art and is insufficient to differentiate the invention of claim **[2]** from the prior art.

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 1, recite the claim limitation that relates to a tax strategy. For more information see **[MPEP § 2124.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//ch2100_d1b13f_20224_b9.html)**.

2. In bracket 2, insert claim number(s), pluralize "claim" as appropriate.

## III.    **EXAMPLES DIRECTED TO COMPUTER-IMPLEMENTED METHODS**

A computer-implemented method that is deemed novel and non-obvious would not be affected by this provision even if used for a tax purpose. For example, a novel and non-obvious computer-implemented method for manipulating data would not be affected by this provision even if the method organized data for a future tax filing. However, a prior art computer-implemented method would not become non-obvious by implementing a novel and non-obvious tax strategy. That is, the presence of limitations relating to the tax strategy would not cause a claim that is otherwise within the prior art to become novel or non-obvious over the prior art.

Thus, for purposes of applying art to a software-related invention under **[35 U.S](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e197004.html#//d0e302383.html)**
