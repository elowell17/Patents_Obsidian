*****

- (b) MAINTENANCE FEES
    - (1) IN GENERAL. — The Director shall charge the following fees for maintaining in force all patents based on applications filed on or after December 12, 1980:
        - (A) Three years and 6 months after grant, $980.
        - (B) Seven years and 6 months after grant, $2,480.
        - (C) Eleven years and 6 months after grant, $4,110.
    - (2) GRACE PERIOD; SURCHARGE. — Unless payment of the applicable maintenance fee under paragraph (1) is received in the Office on or before the date the fee is due or within a grace period of 6 months thereafter, the patent shall expire as of the end of such grace period. The Director may require the payment of a surcharge as a condition of accepting within such 6-month grace period the payment of an applicable maintenance fee.
    - (3) NO MAINTENANCE FEE FOR DESIGN OR PLANT PATENT. — No fee may be established for maintaining a design or plant patent in force.
- (c) DELAYS IN PAYMENT OF MAINTENANCE FEES. —
    - (1) ACCEPTANCE. — The Director may accept the payment of any maintenance fee required by subsection (b) after the 6-month grace period if the delay is shown to the satisfaction of the Director to have been unintentional. The Director may require the payment of the fee specified in subsection (a)(7) as a condition of accepting payment of any maintenance fee after the 6-month grace period. If the Director accepts payment of a maintenance fee after the 6-month grace period, the patent shall be considered as not having expired at the end of the grace period.
    - (2) EFFECT ON RIGHTS OF OTHERS.— A patent, the term of which has been maintained as a result of the acceptance of a payment of a maintenance fee under this subsection, shall not abridge or affect the right of any person or that person’s successors in business who made, purchased, offered to sell, or used anything protected by the patent within the United States, or imported anything protected by the patent into the United States after the 6-month grace period but prior to the acceptance of a maintenance fee under this subsection, to continue the use of, to offer for sale, or to sell to others to be used, offered for sale, or sold, the specific thing so made, purchased, offered for sale, used, or imported. The court before which such matter is in question may provide for the continued manufacture, use, offer for sale, or sale of the thing made, purchased, offered for sale, or used within the United States, or imported into the United States, as specified, or for the manufacture, use, offer for sale, or sale in the United States of which substantial preparation was made after the 6-month grace period but before the acceptance of a maintenance fee under this subsection, and the court may also provide for the continued practice of any process that is practiced, or for the practice of which substantial preparation was made, after the 6-month grace period but before the acceptance of a maintenance fee under this subsection, to the extent and under such terms as the court deems equitable for the protection of investments made or business commenced after the 6-month grace period but before the acceptance of a maintenance fee under this subsection.

    - (3) For a continuing (continuation, division, continuation-in-part) application claiming the benefit of a prior patent application under **[35 U.S.C. 120](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e303023313.html)**, the actual United States filing date of the continuing application.
    - (4) For a reissue application, including a continuing reissue application claiming the benefit of a reissue application under **[35 U.S.C. 120](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e303023313.html)**, [the] United States filing date of the original non-reissue application on which the patent reissued is based.
    - (5) For an international application which has entered the United States as a Designated Office under **[35 U.S.C. 371](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e307164.html)**, the international filing date granted under **[Article 11(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e363237.html##d0e363245)**  of the Patent Cooperation Treaty which is considered to be the United States filing date under **[35 U.S.C. 363](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e306994.html)**.
- (d) Maintenance fees may be paid in patents without surcharge during the periods extending respectively from:
    - (1) 3 years through 3 years and 6 months after grant for the first maintenance fee,
    - (2) 7 years through 7 years and 6 months after grant for the second maintenance fee, and
    - (3) 11 years through 11 years and 6 months after grant for the third maintenance fee.
- (e) Maintenance fees may be paid with the surcharge set forth in **[§ 1.20(h)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e316217.html##d0e316403)**  during the respective grace periods after:
    - (1) 3 years and 6 months and through the day of the 4th anniversary of the grant for the first maintenance fee.
    - (2) 7 years and 6 months and through the day of the 8th anniversary of the grant for the second maintenance fee, and

- (g) Unless the maintenance fee and any applicable surcharge is paid within the time periods set forth in paragraphs (d), (e) or (f) of this section, the patent will expire as of the end of the grace period set forth in paragraph (e) of this section. A patent which expires for the failure to pay the maintenance fee will expire at the end of the same date (anniversary date) the patent was granted in the 4th, 8th, or 12th year after grant.
- (h) The periods specified in **[§§ 1.362(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e326870.html##d0e326931)**  and **[37 CFR 1.362(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e326870.html##d0e326947)**  with respect to a reissue application, including a continuing reissue application thereof, are counted from the date of grant of the original non-reissue application on which the reissued patent is based.

Maintenance fees are required to be paid on all patents based on applications filed on or after December 12, 1980, except for plant patents and design patents. Furthermore, maintenance fees are required for a reissue patent unless the patent being reissued did not require maintenance fees. See subsection I below for more information regarding the payment of maintenance fees in reissue utility patents and original utility patents for which a reissue application is pending.

Application filing dates for purposes of determining whether a patent is subject to payment of maintenance fees are as follows:

- (A) For an application not claiming benefit of an earlier application, the actual United States filing date of the application.
- (B) For an application claiming benefit of an earlier foreign application under **[35 U.S.C. 119(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e302921.html)**  - **[(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e302921.html##d0e302947)**, the actual United States filing date of the application.
- (C) For a continuing (continuation, division, continuation-in-part) application claiming the benefit of a prior patent application under **[35 U.S.C. 120](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e303023313.html)**, the actual United States filing date of the continuing application.
- (D) For a reissue application, including a continuing reissue application claiming the benefit of a reissue application under **[35 U.S.C. 120](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e303023313.html)**, the United States filing date of the original nonreissue application on which the patent reissued is based.
- (E) For an international application that has entered the United States as a Designated Office under **[35 U.S.C. 371](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e301581.html)**, the international filing date granted under **[Article 11(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e363237.html##d0e363245)**  of the Patent Cooperation Treaty which is considered to be the United States filing date under **[35 U.S.C. 363](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e306994.html)**.

The term of a utility patent that can be maintained in force by the payment of maintenance fees may be lengthened by any patent term extension under **[35 U.S.C. 156](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e303884.html)**  or adjustment under **[35 U.S.C. 154](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e303482.html)**, or may be reduced if there is any disclaimed term. Subject to the payment of maintenance fees and any patent term extension, adjustment, or disclaimer, the patent term begins on the date the patent issues and ends 20 years from the date the application was filed, or if the application claims the benefit of an earlier filed U.S. application or applications (excluding provisional applications), the patent term ends 20 years from the date the earliest such application was filed (hereafter, 20 year term). For utility and plant applications filed prior to June 8, 1995, the patent term is the greater of the 20 year term or 17 years from the patent issue date subject to any disclaimer or term extension.

## I.    **REISSUE UTILITY PATENTS AND ORIGINAL UTILITY PATENTS FOR WHICH AN APPLICATION FOR REISSUE IS PENDING**

Effective January 16, 2018, each reissue utility patent requires its own maintenance fee payment during the unexpired part of the term of the original patent (unless the original patent was filed before December 12, 1980). This practice requires a maintenance fee to be paid in each reissue patent in force on (i.e., issued before) the maintenance fee due date. This includes all reissue patents that replace the same original patent ("multiple reissued patents") and have maintenance fees due on or after January 16, 2018. This practice also includes a requirement for maintenance fee payments in original patents that are not surrendered because one or more reissue applications of the same original patent are still pending on the maintenance fee due date. In summary, for maintenance fees due on or after January 16, 2018, a separate payment of the maintenance fee is required for each reissue patent based on a single original patent, and for the original patent if there is a pending reissue application based on the same original patent, to maintain each reissue patent and the original patent in force beyond the 4th, 8th, or 12th anniversary of the grant date of the original patent. The due date for a maintenance fee is the last day the maintenance fee may be paid without a surcharge under **[37 CFR 1.362(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e326870.html##d0e326931)**. See **[MPEP § 2506](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e248200.html)** for more information on the times for submitting maintenance fee payments.

The former practice of requiring only one maintenance fee in the latest issued reissue patent for all reissue patents based on the same original patent and for the original patent was discontinued on January 16, 2018. Accordingly, maintenance fee payments that were due on January 15, 2018 were the last maintenance fees payable under the former practice.

## A.   **_Maintenance Fee Payments for Multiple Reissued Utility Patents_**

Effective January 16, 2018, each reissue patent of an original utility patent that was issued from an application filed on or after December 12, 1980 and that is in force on the relevant maintenance fee due date (i.e., the 3½, 7½, or 11½ year date) requires its own maintenance fee payment.

In some instances, more than one reissue patent will be granted to replace a single original patent. "Multiple reissued patents" that replace a single original patent are provided for in **[35 U.S.C. 251(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e305345912.html##al_d1d85b_2c052_2b7)**. See **[MPEP § 1451](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e142761.html)**. In these instances, each of the reissue utility patents requires payment of its own set of maintenance fees in order to prevent expiration of the reissue patent. The maintenance fee payment schedule established for the original patent continues to apply to each reissue patent such that the maintenance fee due dates are based on the date of the original patent grant. Based on the maintenance fee due dates, the time periods for paying maintenance fees in reissue utility patents are set forth in paragraphs (d) and (e) of **[37 CFR 1.362](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e326870.html)**. See **[MPEP § 2506](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e248200.html)** for more information on the times for submitting maintenance fee payments. To prevent expiration of any reissue patent, including each reissue patent based on a single original patent, any maintenance fee with a due date on or after January 16, 2018 must be paid in each reissue patent in force on the maintenance fee due date.

## B.   **_Maintenance Fee Payments for Original Utility Patents Not Surrendered by Reissue_**

Effective January 16, 2018, the original patent requires a separate maintenance fee payment if at least one reissue application based on the original patent is pending on the maintenance fee due date (i.e., the 3½, 7½, or 11½ year date) even if a maintenance fee payment is made in reissue patent(s) that have issued from the same original patent.

**[35 U.S.C. 251](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e305345912.html)**  permits reissue only for "the unexpired part of the term of the original patent." An original patent is not surrendered under **[35 U.S.C. 252](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e305365.html)**  until a reissue application, based on the original patent, issues as a reissue patent and no other reissue application, based on the same original patent, is still pending. Because it is the granting of the reissue patent – and not the filing of the reissue application - that effectuates surrender of the original patent under **[35 U.S.C. 252](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e305365.html)**, maintenance fees remain due in the original patent whenever an application for reissue of the original patent is pending on the maintenance fee due date. Specifically, when one or more reissue patents have issued and at least one application for reissue of the same original patent remains pending, the original patent is not surrendered and maintenance fees remain due in the original patent until the last remaining reissue application issues as a reissue patent or becomes abandoned. In other words, while there is an application for reissue pending in a reissue patent family, maintenance fee payments will be required in _both_ the original patent and the corresponding reissue patent(s).

## C.   **_Example_**

A total of three applications were filed for reissue of the same original utility patent, which issued on August 27, 2010. The reissue applications result in first and second reissue patents granted on June 18, 2013 and June 25, 2013, respectively. The third reissue application based on the original patent is scheduled to issue as the third reissue patent on March 20, 2018 (after the February 27, 2018 due date for the 7½ year maintenance fee). The 3½ year maintenance fee, which was due on February 27, 2014, was paid in the second reissue patent on December 6, 2013, under the former practice that required only one set of maintenance fees in the latest issued reissue patent. The 7½ year maintenance fee due date is Tuesday, February 27, 2018, which is 7½ years after the August 27, 2010 issue date of the original patent.

The following steps are used to determine which patents in the patent family (i.e., the original patent and all reissue patents from the original patent) require payment of the 7½ year maintenance fee:

- 1. Determine whether the new practice applies. For the new practice of more than one maintenance fee being due to apply, the reissue patent family based on an original utility patent will include more than one reissue patent, or at least one reissue patent and at least one pending application for reissue, of the same original utility patent and have maintenance fees due on or after January 16, 2018.
    
    In this example, the patent family has two reissue patents and a pending reissue application. The 7½ year maintenance fee due date is February 27, 2018, which is after the January 16, 2018 effective date of the new practice set forth in this notice. Therefore, the new practice applies.
    
- 2. Determine which of the reissue patents in the patent family require separate payment of the maintenance fee.
    
    In this example, the first and second reissue patents were granted in June 2013 and remain in force on January 16, 2018. Therefore, to avoid expiration of the first and second reissue patents, the 7½ year maintenance fee must be separately paid in both the first and second reissue patents, regardless of whether the maintenance fee(s) are paid before, on, or after January 16, 2018. Note that if any of the required maintenance fee payments are made during the grace period beginning on February 28, 2018 and ending on August 27, 2018, the surcharge under **[37 CFR 1.20(h)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e316217.html##d0e316403)**  must be included with each maintenance fee payment made during the grace period.
    
- 3. Determine whether the original utility patent requires separate payment of the maintenance fee.
    
    The maintenance fee must be paid if the maintenance fee due date is before the date the original patent is surrendered (i.e., the date the last remaining application for reissue of the original patent issues as a reissue patent or becomes abandoned). Any time an application for reissue of the original patent is still pending on the maintenance fee due date, the maintenance fee must be paid in the original patent.
    
    In this example, the third reissue application is still pending on the February 27, 2018 maintenance fee due date and is not scheduled to issue as a reissue patent until March 20, 2018. Therefore, the 7½ year maintenance fee must be paid in the original patent to avoid expiration of the third reissue patent. To avoid any uncertainty in the record about payment of the maintenance fee, payment should be made prior to March 20, 2018 because when the third reissue application issues as a reissue patent, the original patent is surrendered and ceases to exist. If the maintenance fee is paid on or after March 20, 2018, payment must still be made in the original patent because the maintenance fee was due before surrender of the original patent. In addition, if the 7½ year maintenance fee is paid during the grace period beginning on February 28, 2018 and ending on August 27, 2018, the maintenance fee payment must include the surcharge under **[37 CFR 1.20(h)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e316217.html##d0e316403)**.
    

In the example above, note that the 7½ year maintenance fee would be the first maintenance fee ever paid in both the original patent and the first reissue patent because the 3½ year maintenance fee was paid (four years ago) in only the second reissue patent under the former practice that required maintenance fee payment in only the latest issued reissue patent. Also, note that if the original utility patent, which issued on August 27, 2010 in the example, was instead issued on June 15, 2010, the 7½ year maintenance fee would be due prior to the January 16, 2018 effective date. In this situation, the 7½ year maintenance fee would only be due in the latest issued reissue patent under the former practice, even if the 7½ year maintenance fee and surcharge under **[37 CFR 1.20(h)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e316217.html##d0e316403)**  are paid on or after the January 16, 2018 effective date during the grace period.

# 2506    Times for Submitting Maintenance Fee Payments [R-10.2019]

Maintenance fees cannot be paid in advance since **[35 U.S.C. 41(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e307164.html)**  permits maintenance fees to be adjusted every year on October 1 to reflect any fluctuations during the previous 12 months in the Consumer Price Index as determined by the Secretary of Labor.

**[37 CFR 1.362(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e326870.html)**  sets forth the time periods when the maintenance fees for a utility patent can be paid without surcharge. Those periods, referred to generally as the "window period," are the 6-month periods preceding each due date. The "due dates" are defined in **[35 U.S.C. 41(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e301581.html)**. The window periods are (1) 3 years to 3 1/2 years after the date of issue for the first maintenance fee payment, (2) 7 years to 7 1/2 years after the date of issue for the second maintenance fee payment, and (3) 11 years to 11 1/2 years after the date of issue for the third and final maintenance fee payment. A maintenance fee paid on the last day of a window period can be paid without surcharge. The last day of a window period is the same day of the month the patent was granted 3 years and 6 months, 7 years and 6 months, or 11 years and 6 months after grant of the patent.

**[37 CFR 1.362(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e326870.html)**  sets forth the time periods when the maintenance fees for a utility patent can be paid with surcharge. Those periods, referred to generally as the "grace period," are the 6-month periods immediately following each due date. The grace periods are (1) 3 1/2 years and through the day of the 4th anniversary of the grant of the patent, (2) 7 1/2 years and through the day of the 8th anniversary of the grant of the patent and, (3) 11 1/2 years and through the day of the 12th anniversary of the grant of the patent. A maintenance fee may be paid with the surcharge on the same date (anniversary date) the patent was granted in the 4th, 8th, or 12th year after grant to prevent the patent from expiring.

Maintenance fees for all reissue patents are due based upon the schedule established for the original utility patent. The filing of a request for _ex parte_ or _inter partes_ reexamination and/or the publication of a reexamination certificate does not alter the schedule of maintenance fee payments of the original patent.

If the day for paying a maintenance fee falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or a federal holiday within the District of Columbia, the maintenance fee may be paid on the next succeeding day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or federal holiday. For example, if the window period for paying a maintenance fee without a surcharge ended on a Saturday, Sunday, or a federal holiday within the District of Columbia, the maintenance fee can be paid without surcharge on the next succeeding day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or a federal holiday within the District of Columbia. Likewise, if the grace period for paying a maintenance fee with a surcharge ended on a Saturday, Sunday, or a federal holiday within the District of Columbia, the maintenance fee can be paid with surcharge on the next succeeding day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or a federal holiday within the District of Columbia. In the latter situation, the failure to pay the maintenance fee and surcharge on the next succeeding day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or a federal holiday within the District of Columbia will result in the patent expiring on a date (4, 8, or 12 years after the date of grant) earlier than the last date on which the maintenance fee and surcharge could be paid. This situation results from the provisions of **[35 U.S.C. 21](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e301434.html)**, but those provisions do not extend the expiration date of the patent if the maintenance fee and any required surcharge are not paid when required. For example, if the grace period for paying a maintenance fee with a surcharge ended on a Saturday, the maintenance fee and surcharge could be paid on the next succeeding business day, e.g., Monday, but the patent will have expired after midnight on Saturday (e.g., on Sunday) if the maintenance fee and surcharge were not paid on the following Monday. Therefore, if the maintenance fee and any applicable surcharge are not paid, the patent will expire as of the end of the grace period as listed above. A patent that expires for failure of payment will expire on the day following the anniversary date the patent was granted in the 4th, 8th, or 12th year after the grant.

See **[MPEP § 501](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e24257.html)**, subsection III for information regarding hand-delivery of papers. Although the receptionist will not process the maintenance fee payment, if the payment is delivered with an itemized postcard, the receptionist will provide a delivery receipt by date stamping the postcard. The maintenance fee payment should be placed in an envelope with MAINTENANCE FEE written in dark ink across the envelope.

# 2511-2514    [Reserved]

# 2515    Information Required for Submission of Maintenance Fee Payment [R-07.2015]

#### _37 C.F.R. 1.366   Submission of maintenance fees._

- (a) The patentee may pay maintenance fees and any necessary surcharges, or any person or organization may pay maintenance fees and any necessary surcharges on behalf of a patentee. A maintenance fee transmittal letter may be signed by a juristic applicant or patent owner. A patentee need not file authorization to enable any person or organization to pay maintenance fees and any necessary surcharges on behalf of the patentee.
- (b) A maintenance fee and any necessary surcharge submitted for a patent must be submitted in the amount due on the date the maintenance fee and any necessary surcharge are paid. A maintenance fee or surcharge may be paid in the manner set forth in **[§ 1.23](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e316783.html)**  or by an authorization to charge a deposit account established pursuant to **[§ 1.25](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e316815.html)**. Payment of a maintenance fee and any necessary surcharge or the authorization to charge a deposit account must be submitted within the periods set forth in **[§ 1.362(d), (e), or (f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e326870.html)**. Any payment or authorization of maintenance fees and surcharges filed at any other time will not be accepted and will not serve as a payment of the maintenance fee except insofar as a delayed payment of the maintenance fee is accepted by the Director in an expired patent pursuant to a petition filed under **[§ 1.378](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e327126.html)**. Any authorization to charge a deposit account must authorize the immediate charging of the maintenance fee and any necessary  surcharge to the deposit account. Payment of less than the required amount, payment in a manner other than that set forth in **[§ 1.23](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e316783.html)**, or in the filing of an authorization to charge a deposit account having insufficient funds will not constitute payment of a maintenance fee or surcharge on a patent. The procedures set forth in **[§ 1.8](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e313726.html)**  or **[§ 1.10](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e313951.html)**  may be utilized in paying maintenance fees and any necessary surcharges.
- (c) In submitting maintenance fees and any necessary surcharges, identification of the patents for which maintenance fees are being paid must include the patent number, and the application number of the United States application for the patent on which the maintenance fee is being paid. If the payment includes identification of only the patent number (_i.e._, does not identify the application number of the United States application for the patent on which the maintenance fee is being paid), the Office may apply the payment to the patent identified by patent number in the payment or may return the payment.
- (d) Payment of maintenance fees and any surcharges should identify the fee being paid for each patent as to whether it is the 3 1/2-, 7 1/2-, or 11 1/2-year fee, whether small entity status is being changed or claimed, the amount of the maintenance fee and any surcharge being paid, and any assigned customer number. If the maintenance fee and any necessary surcharge is being paid on a reissue patent, the payment must identify the reissue patent by reissue patent number and reissue application number as required by paragraph (c) of this section and should also include the original patent number.
- (e) Maintenance fee payments and surcharge payments relating thereto must be submitted separate from any other payments for fees or charges, whether submitted in the manner set forth in **[§ 1.23](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e316783.html)**  or by an authorization to charge a deposit account. If maintenance fee and surcharge payments for more than one patent are submitted together, they should be submitted on as few sheets as possible with the patent numbers listed in increasing patent number order. If the payment submitted is insufficient to cover the maintenance fees and surcharges for all the listed patents, the payment will be applied in the order the patents are listed, beginning at the top of the listing.
- (f) Notification of any change in status resulting in loss of entitlement to small entity status must be filed in a patent prior to paying, or at the time of paying, the earliest maintenance fee due after the date on which status as a small entity is no longer appropriate. See **[§ 1.27(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e316949.html)**.
- (g) Maintenance fees and surcharges relating thereto will not be refunded except in accordance with **[§§ 1.26](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e316905.html)**  and **[1.28(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e317241.html)**.

**[37 CFR 1.366](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e327022.html)**  establishes the guidelines and procedures for submission of maintenance fees, including any necessary surcharges. The patentee may pay maintenance fees and any necessary surcharges or any person or organization may pay maintenance fees and any necessary surcharges on behalf of the patentee without filing in the Office evidence of authorization by the patentee to pay maintenance fees. This will enable patentees to pay the maintenance fees and any necessary surcharges themselves or authorize some person or organization to pay maintenance fees and any necessary surcharges on their behalf. No verification of the authority to pay maintenance fees and any necessary surcharges in a particular patent will be made by the Office. While anyone may pay the maintenance fees and any necessary surcharges on a patent, if the payment is accepted by the Office, any Office notices relating to maintenance fees and any necessary surcharges will be mailed to the "fee address" set forth in **[37 CFR 1.363](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e326984.html)**. If the payment is not accepted by the Office, it will be returned to the person who submitted the payment if a return address is available. It is strongly recommended that the payor should include a return address along with his or her telephone number since the Office may contact the payor in some instances when it is unclear to which patent the fees are to be applied. See **[MPEP § 2530](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e248646.html)**.

A maintenance fee and any necessary surcharge for a patent must be submitted in the amount due on the date the maintenance fee and any necessary surcharge are paid, and at the proper time, i.e., within the periods set forth in **[37 CFR 1.362](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e326870.html)**. If the amount of the maintenance fee is correct on the date it is paid and credited to the patent, a later change in the maintenance fees to reflect a new fee amount will not require a modification in the amount paid.

**[37 CFR 1.366(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e327022.html)**  provides that a maintenance fee payment must include the patent number and the application number on which the maintenance fee is being paid. If the payment includes identification of only the patent number (i.e., does not identify the application number for the patent on which the maintenance fee is being paid), the Office may apply the payment to the patent identified by patent number in the payment or may return the payment. See **[MPEP § 2530](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e248646.html)**. The application number required to be submitted is not that of a prior parent application, but rather the application number of the actual application that matured into the patent for which maintenance fees are to be paid. If the maintenance fee and any necessary surcharge is being paid on a reissue patent, the application number required is that of the reissue application.

If a patent expires because the maintenance fee and any necessary surcharge have not been paid in the manner required by **[37 CFR 1.366](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e327022.html)**, the patentee could proceed under **[37 CFR 1.378](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e327126.html)**  (see **[MPEP § 2590](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e249289.html)**), if appropriate, or could file a petition under **[37 CFR 1.377](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e327097.html)**  (see **[MPEP § 2580](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e249175.html)**) within the period set therein seeking to have the maintenance fee accepted as timely even though not all of the required identifying data was present prior to expiration of the grace period.

Under **[37 CFR 1.366(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e327022.html)**, the following information should also be submitted for each patent on which a maintenance fee or surcharge is paid (**[37 CFR 1.366(d))](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e327022.html)**:

- (A) the fee year (i.e., 3 1/2, 7 1/2, or 11 1/2 year fee);
- (B) the amount of the maintenance fee and any surcharge being submitted;
- (C) any assigned customer number; and
- (D) whether entity status is being changed or claimed with the payment.

Where the payment is a maintenance fee and any necessary surcharge on a reissue patent, in addition to the information requested for all payments, it is requested that the original patent number be furnished. Although the submission of the information requested under **[37 CFR 1.366(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e327022.html)**  is not mandatory, it would expedite the processing of maintenance fee payments.

The Maintenance Fee Transmittal Form, PTO/SB/45 should be used when submitting maintenance fees by mail or by facsimile transmission. This form is available, upon request, from the Maintenance Fee Branch. It is also available from the USPTO website (**[www.uspto.gov/patent/patents-forms#patent](http://www.uspto.gov/patent/patents-forms#patent)** ).

The Office processes fees in the order in which they are presented. If the payment submitted is insufficient to cover the maintenance fees and surcharges for all patents listed, and there is no general authorization to charge a deposit account, the payment will be applied in the order the patents are listed, beginning at the top of the listing.

# 2520    Maintenance Fee Amounts [R-01.2024]

**[37 CFR 1.20(e)-(h)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e316217.html)**  sets the fee amounts for the maintenance fees and the grace period surcharge. The maintenance fee amounts are subject to adjustment to reflect fluctuations occurring in the Consumer Price Index pursuant to **[35 U.S.C. 41(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e301581.html)**. The maintenance fee amounts (**[37 CFR 1.20(e)-(h)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e316217.html)** ) are subject to a 60% reduction for small entities pursuant to **[35 U.S.C. 41(h)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e301581.html)**  and an 80% reduction for micro entities. The Maintenance Fee Branch may be contacted or the USPTO Fee Information website (**[www.uspto.gov/Fees](http://www.uspto.gov/Fees)** ) may be accessed for the current maintenance fee amounts.

The term of a patent might be shortened, e.g., by a terminal disclaimer. If a patent will expire part way between the due dates set in **[35 U.S.C. 41(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e301581.html)**, or between the latest due date and the term set in **[35 U.S.C. 154](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e303482.html)**, it is still required that the entire maintenance fee amount for the due date be paid. The maintenance fee amount cannot be prorated to cover only the amount of time past the due date before the patent expires.

**[37 CFR 1.366(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e327022.html)**  provides that maintenance fees and surcharges relating thereto will not be refunded except in accordance with **[37 CFR 1.26](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e316905.html)**  and **[1.28(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e317241.html)**. A patentee cannot obtain a refund of a maintenance fee that was due and payable on the patent. Any duplicate payment will be refunded to the fee submitter.

# 2521    [Reserved]

# 2522    Methods of Payment [R-10.2019]

The method of payment for the maintenance fee and any necessary surcharge is set forth in **[37 CFR 1.23](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e316783.html)**. The payment shall be made in U.S. dollars and in the form of a cashier’s or certified check, Treasury note, national bank notes, or United States Postal Service money order as provided in **[37 CFR 1.23(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e316783.html)**. If the maintenance fee and any necessary surcharge is sent in any other form, the Office may delay or cancel the credit until collection is made. For example, a personal or other uncertified check drawn on a U.S. bank that is not immediately negotiable, e.g., because it lacks a signature or due to insufficient funds, will not constitute payment of a maintenance fee and/or surcharge.

The maintenance fee can be charged to a credit card as set forth in **[37 CFR 1.23(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e316783.html)**, but credit for the payment is subject to actual receipt of the fee by the Office. Credit Card Payment Form (PTO-2038) should be used for payment of fees by credit card unless the payment is submitted over the internet. If credit card information is provided on a form or document other than the form provided by the Office for the payment of fees by credit card, the Office will not be liable if the credit card number becomes public knowledge. See **[MPEP § 509](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e30377.html)**.

Any remittance from a foreign country must be payable and immediately negotiable in the United States for the full amount of the maintenance fee and/or surcharge required.

**[37 CFR 1.366(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e327022.html)**  provides that maintenance fees and any necessary surcharge may be paid by authorization to charge a deposit account established pursuant to **[37 CFR 1.25](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e316815.html)**. The authorization to charge the deposit account must be submitted within an appropriate window or grace period and must be limited to maintenance fees and surcharges payable on the date of submission. The authorization to charge the deposit account cannot be submitted prior to the third, seventh, or eleventh year after grant of the patent. If an authorization to charge a deposit account were submitted to pay the maintenance fee due at 3 years and 6 months after grant, a new authorization to charge a deposit account or other form of payment will have to be submitted at the appropriate time for each of the maintenance fees due at 7 years and 6 months and 11 years and 6 months. Any payment or authorization filed at any time other than that set forth in **[37 CFR 1.362(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e326870.html##d0e326931)**, **[(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e326870.html##d0e326947)**, or **[(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e326870.html##d0e326966)**  will not serve as a payment of the maintenance fee, except insofar as a delayed payment of the maintenance fee is accepted by the Director pursuant to **[37 CFR 1.378](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e327126.html)**. See **[MPEP § 2590](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e249289.html)**. A payment of less than the required amount, a payment in a manner other than that set forth in **[37 CFR 1.23](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e316783.html)**, or the filing of an authorization to charge a deposit account having insufficient funds, will not constitute payment of a maintenance fee on a patent. The authorization is required to permit the immediate charging of the maintenance fee to the deposit account. An authorization would be improper if it only authorized the maintenance fee to be charged at a later date, e.g., on the last possible day of payment without surcharge. Such an authorization would not serve as payment of the maintenance fee. Any payment which fails to result in the entire proper amount of the maintenance fee being present on the due date will not constitute payment of the maintenance fee.

Maintenance fee payments and any surcharges relating thereto must be submitted separately from any other payments for fees or charges, whether submitted in the manner set forth in **[37 CFR 1.23](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e316783.html)**  or by authorization to charge a deposit account. See **[37 CFR 1.366(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e327022.html)**. Maintenance fee payments and surcharge payments relating thereto that are commingled with payments for other fees or charges, e.g., application filing fees, issue fees, document supply fees, etc., will not be accepted. Maintenance fees require processing by a separate area of the Office and are not processed in the same manner as other fees and charges. Maintenance fees for a number of patents can be submitted together in one submission and one payment. **[37 CFR 1.366(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e327022.html)**  specifies that if maintenance fee payments for more than one patent are submitted together, they should be submitted on as few sheets as possible, listing the patent numbers in increasing patent number order. If the payment submitted is insufficient to cover the maintenance fees and any surcharges for all the listed patents, the payment will be applied in the order the patents are listed. In such a circumstance the maintenance fee and any surcharge for one or more of the last listed patents will not be paid.

Money orders and checks must be made payable to the Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office. (Checks made payable to the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks will continue to be accepted. See **[37 CFR 1.23(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e316783.html)** ). Remittances from foreign countries must be payable and immediately negotiable in the United States for the full amount required.

# 2530    Special Acceptance of Maintenance Fee Payments Containing Informalities [R-07.2015]

It is strongly recommended that a maintenance fee submission by mail or facsimile include both a telephone number and a mailing address for the fee submitter because, provided the fee is sufficient, the Office may attempt to contact the submitter by telephone and/or by mail to confirm the patent to which the fee is to be applied. If the Office specially accepts a payment under any one of scenarios I – III below, a Notice of Special Acceptance of Patent Maintenance Fee (PTO-2143) will be mailed to the submitter that identifies the patent number and application number to which the maintenance fee was applied and requests the submitter to verify that the payment was applied as intended. If the payment was not applied to the intended patent, a petition (such as a petition under **[37 CFR 1.377](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e327097.html)** ) must be filed. If the petition is not filed within 2 months of the date of the notice (PTO-2143), the petition may be dismissed as untimely, and relief may have to be pursued under **[37 CFR 1.378(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e327126.html##d0e327134)**  - **[(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e327126.html##d0e327166)**.

## I.    **PATENT NUMBER SUPPLIED BUT NO APPLICATION NUMBER SUPPLIED**

If a maintenance fee payment identifies only the patent number (i.e., does not identify the application number for the patent on which the maintenance fee is being paid), the Office may apply the payment to the patent identified by the patent number in the payment or may return the payment. See **[37 CFR 1.366(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e327022.html)**.

## II.    **PATENT NUMBER AND APPLICATION NUMBER SUPPLIED BUT THEY DO NOT CORRESPOND**

When a patent number and an application number are both supplied, but they do not correspond to the same patent, the Office will generally apply the payment to the patent identified by the patent number, if possible. Even if the payment is sufficient and timely to pay the maintenance fee due in the patent identified by the patent number, the Office may return the payment if additional information on the payment submission is inconsistent with the patent identified by the patent number. The Office may even apply the payment to the patent identified by the application number if the additional information corroborates that patent. Such may be the case, for example, where the fee submitter is the addressee named in the correspondence address or fee address of the patent identified by the application number.

## III.    **NO PATENT NUMBER SUPPLIED BUT APPLICATION NUMBER SUPPLIED**

If a maintenance fee is due on the patent identified by the application number and the payment submitted is sufficient, the Office may apply the payment to the patent (provided additional corroborating information is present) or may return the payment.

# 2531    Payment Late or Insufficient [R-07.2015]

Examples of when a payment of maintenance fees and any necessary surcharges will be considered to be late or insufficient include instances when:

- (A) Though a payment was received, additional funds are required due to surcharge or fee increase;
- (B) Though a payment was received in an amount for small entity, the patented file records do not indicate that an assertion of small entity status was received; or
- (C) The payment was received after the patent expired.

If the Office considers a payment to be late or insufficient, a notice (e.g., a Notice of Non-Acceptance of Patent Maintenance Fee (PTO-2142)) will be sent to the "fee submitter." Reply to the notice is required prior to expiration of the grace period provided by **[37 CFR 1.362(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e326870.html)**  in order to avoid the expiration of the patent. If a reply is not received prior to expiration of the patent, then an appropriate petition under **[37 CFR 1.377](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e327097.html)**  or **[37 CFR 1.378](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e327126.html)**  is required. See **[MPEP § 2580](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e249175.html)** and **[§ 2590](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e249289.html)**.

If a payment is deemed insufficient because the payment was submitted in a discounted amount but entitlement to the entity status (small or micro) corresponding to the discounted amount was not established, an Underpayment Notice or Non-Acceptance Notice will be mailed to the fee submitter. See **[MPEP § 2550](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e248961.html)** for information on establishing or changing an entity status for the purpose of paying a maintenance fee.

# 2532    Duplicate Payments [R-08.2017]

In the event a maintenance fee is submitted (hereafter, duplicate payment) in the required amount (including any necessary surcharge) within the payment window for the patent identified for payment, but the same maintenance fee for that patent was already paid by a previous fee submitter (hereafter, first fee submitter), the Office intends to treat the duplicate payment from the second fee submitter as follows:

- (A) If the duplicate payment does not comply with **[37 CFR 1.366(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e327022.html)**  by not containing both the patent number and the corroborating application number, the Office will return the duplicate payment to the second fee submitter with an indication that the maintenance fee for the patent was already paid.
- (B) If the duplicate payment does comply with **[37 CFR 1.366(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e327022.html)**  by containing both the patent number and the corroborating application number, the Office will verify that the first payment was properly processed.
    - (1) If the first payment was properly processed, the Office will return the duplicate payment to the second fee submitter. In this event the returned payment will be accompanied by identification of the first fee submitter.
    - (2) If a review of the Office record of the first maintenance fee payment reveals that the first payment was not properly processed (e.g., did not comply with **[37 CFR 1.366(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e327022.html)**  or was not specially accepted in accordance with **[MPEP § 2530](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e248646.html)**), the Office will attempt to determine whether the first payment should have been applied to a patent other than the patent identified under **[37 CFR 1.366(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e327022.html)**  by the second fee submitter. Based on this determination the Office will: (a) attempt to apply the duplicate payment (and retract the first payment); or (b) return the duplicate payment to the second fee submitter with identification of the first fee submitter.

# 2540    Fee Address for Maintenance Fee Purposes [R-08.2017]

#### _37 C.F.R. 1.363   Fee address for maintenance fee purposes._

- (a) All notices, receipts, refunds, and other communications relating to payment or refund of maintenance fees will be directed to the correspondence address used during prosecution of the application as indicated in **[§ 1.33(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//aia_d0e317491.html##aia_d0e317499)**  unless:
    - (1) A fee address for purposes of payment of maintenance fees is set forth when submitting the issue fee, or
    - (2) A change in the correspondence address for all purposes is filed after payment of the issue fee, or
    - (3) A fee address or a change in the "fee address" is filed for purposes of receiving notices, receipts and other correspondence relating to the payment of maintenance fees after the payment of the issue fee, in which instance, the latest such address will be used.
- (b) An assignment of a patent application or patent does not result in a change of the "correspondence address" or "fee address" for maintenance fee purposes.
- (c) A fee address must be an address associated with a Customer Number.

Generally, notices, receipts, and other communications relating to the payment of a maintenance fee will be directed to the correspondence address used during the prosecution of the application, unless a "fee address" for the purpose of payment of the maintenance fee has been designated or a change in the correspondence address has been made (see **[MPEP § 2542](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e248928.html)**). **[37 CFR 1.33(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e317491.html)**  allows a correspondence address or change thereto to be filed during the enforceable life of the patent. Patentees should ensure that the Office is properly notified of the proper "fee address" to which all maintenance fee communications are to be directed.

Under the statutes and rules, the Office has no duty to notify patentee of the requirement to pay maintenance fees or to notify patentee when the maintenance fee is due. It is solely the responsibility of the patentee to ensure that the maintenance fee is paid timely to prevent expiration of the patent. The failure to receive the reminder notice will not shift the burden of monitoring the time for paying a maintenance fee from the patentee to the Office. The Office will attempt to assist patentees through the mailing of a Maintenance Fee Reminder in the grace period. However, the failure to receive a Maintenance Fee Reminder will not relieve the patentee of the obligation to timely pay the appropriate maintenance fee to prevent expiration of the patent. See _Rydeen_ _v._ _Quigg,_ 748 F. Supp. 900, 16 USPQ2d 1876 (D.D.C. 1990), _aff’d_ 937 F.2d 623 (Fed. Cir. 1991) (table), _cert. denied,_ 502 U.S. 1075 (1992). Maintenance fee correspondence will not be directed to more than one address.

**[37 CFR 1.363(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e326984.html##d0e327015)**  states that "[a] fee address must be an address associated with a Customer Number." Only an address represented by a customer number can be established as the fee address for maintenance fee purposes. The use of the following form(s) is suggested when requesting establishment of a fee address: a current version of the "Fee Address" Indication Form (PTO/SB/47), and if necessary, a Request for Customer Number (PTO/SB/125). If a customer number was previously acquired from the Office for the address being designated as the fee address, that customer number should be entered on the "Fee Address" Indication Form (PTO/SB/47) to make the fee address designation. If no customer number was previously acquired from the Office for the address being designated as the fee address, then the "Fee Address" Indication Form (PTO/SB/47) should be accompanied by a completed Request for Customer Number (form PTO/SB/125). See **[MPEP § 403](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e21586.html)** concerning customer number practice.

It is recommended that only a current version of the "Fee Address" Indication Form (PTO/SB/47) available from the USPTO website (**[www.uspto.gov/patent/patents-forms](http://www.uspto.gov/patent/patents-forms)** ) be used when designating a fee address.

At the time of issue fee payment, applicants may designate a fee address by submitting a "Fee Address" Indication Form (PTO/SB/47) as an attachment to the Issue Fee Transmittal (PTOL-85B). After issue fee payment, applicants may designate a fee address by submitting a "Fee Address" Indication Form (PTO/SB/47), and if necessary, a Request for Customer Number (PTO/SB/125), to the address specified on the "Fee Address" Indication Form (PTO/SB/47).

All fee addresses established at the Office will be represented by a customer number, even if the fee address designation lacks an explicit request that a customer number be used for this purpose (e.g., in the event that an outdated "Fee Address" Indication Form (PTO/SB/47), or equivalent form, is submitted without an accompanying Request for Customer Number (PTO/SB/125)).

The current version of the "Fee Address" Indication Form (PTO/SB/47) is available upon request from the Maintenance Fee Branch and from the USPTO website (**[www.uspto.gov](http://www.uspto.gov/)** ). The Request for Customer Number (PTO/SB/125) is available upon request from the Electronic Business Center and from the USPTO website (**[www.uspto.gov](http://www.uspto.gov/)** ). Requests for the establishment of a fee address should be submitted to the Maintenance Fee Branch prior to or at the time of payment of maintenance fees in order to ensure that receipt of payment is directed to the fee address.

Additional patent numbers may be assigned to a customer number at any time, upon written request.

# 2541    [Reserved]

# 2542    Change of Correspondence Address [R-07.2015]

Unless a fee address has been designated, notices, receipts, and other communications relating to the patent will generally be directed to the correspondence address (**[37 CFR 1.33](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e317491.html)** ) used during the prosecution of the application. Practitioners of record when the patent issues who do not wish to receive correspondence relating to maintenance fees must change the correspondence address in the patented file or provide a fee address to which such correspondence should be sent. It is not required that a practitioner file a request for permission to withdraw pursuant to **[37 CFR 1.36](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e317619.html)**  solely for the purpose of changing the correspondence address in a patented file.

The correspondence address should be updated or changed as necessary to ensure that all communications are received in a timely manner. A change of correspondence address may be made as provided in **[pre-AIA 37 CFR 1.33(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e317491.html)**  or **[37 CFR 1.33(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//aia_d0e317491.html##aia_d0e317499)**. The correspondence address may be changed as provided in **[pre-AIA 37 CFR 1.33(a)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e317491.html)**  prior to the filing of an oath or declaration. After an oath or declaration has been executed and filed by at least one inventor, the correspondence address may be changed as provided in **[pre-AIA 37 CFR 1.33(a)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e317491.html)**.

Requests for a change of the correspondence address may be sent to the Office of Patent Application Processing during the enforceable life of the patent. To ensure accuracy and to expedite requests for change to the correspondence address, it is suggested that the request include both the patent number and the application number. The Office form, Change of Correspondence Address, Application (PTO/SB/122) may be used to request a change of correspondence address in a patent application. The Office form, Change of Correspondence Address, Patent (PTO/SB/123) may be used to request a change of correspondence address for an issued patent.

# 2543-2549    [Reserved]

# 2550    Entity Status Discounts [R-01.2024]

Reduced maintenance fees are available for patentees that can establish entitlement to small or micro entity status.

A paper changing the entity status of the patent can be included with a maintenance fee payment submitted by mail, facsimile, or hand delivery. For maintenance fee payments to be made over the internet using the Patent Maintenance Fees Storefront (**[https://fees.uspto.gov/ Maintenance Fees](https://fees.uspto.gov/MaintenanceFees)** ), any change in entity status must be made prior to submitting the payment. Before submitting a payment via the Patent Maintenance Fees Storefront in an entity status different from the entity status of record, it is suggested that the entity status entitlement document (i.e., the certification of micro entity status or written assertion of small entity status) or the document for removal of entity status (i.e., notification of loss of entitlement to micro entity status under **[37 CFR 1.29(i)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//ar_d1fc9c_19092_1c8.html##ar_d1fc9c_19802_31f)**  and/or notification of loss of entitlement to small entity status under **[37 CFR 1.27(g)(2))](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//aia_d0e316949.html##aia_d0e317215)**  as appropriate, be filed by either making the entity status change as a registered user of the USPTO patent electronic filing system or by faxing the document to 571-273-6500 (the maintenance fee transmittal fax number). For information relating to the USPTO patent electronic filing system, including how to update entity status, contact the Electronic Business Center (EBC) at 866-217-9197 or ebc@uspto.gov.

## I.    **CLAIMING ENTITLEMENT TO AN ENTITY STATUS DISCOUNT**

In order to establish small entity status for the purpose of paying a maintenance fee, a written assertion of entitlement to small entity status must be filed prior to or with the maintenance fee paid as a small entity. **[37 CFR 1.27(c)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//aia_d0e316949.html##aia_d0e317085)**  specifies who can sign and file the written assertion of small entity status. A written assertion of small entity status is only required to be filed once and will remain effective until changed. See **[MPEP §§ 509.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e30961.html)** and **[509.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e31381.html)** regarding the requirements for qualifying as a small entity and the requirements for making an assertion of small entity status.

In order to establish micro entity status for the purpose of paying a maintenance fee, a written certification of micro entity status must be filed prior to or at the time the maintenance fee is paid in the micro entity amount. A certification of micro entity status must be signed by a person authorized under **[37 CFR 1.33(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//aia_d0e317491.html##aia_d0e317540)**. See **[MPEP § 509.04](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//ch500_d1ff69_210b3_1ca.html)** regarding the requirements for qualifying as a micro entity as well as the requirements for certifying micro entity status.

The refund provisions of **[37 CFR 1.28(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e317241.html##d0e317249)**  for later submitted small entity assertions do apply to maintenance fees. However, the process in **[37 CFR 1.28(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e317241.html##d0e317249)**  for later establishment of small entity status is not applicable to later submitted micro entity certifications. Accordingly, no refunds are available for later establishment of micro entity status.

## II.    **REMOVAL OF ENTITY STATUS**

Notification of any change in status resulting in loss of entitlement to an entity status must be filed in a patent prior to paying, or at the time of paying, the earliest maintenance fee due after the date on which status as a small or micro entity is no longer appropriate. **[37 CFR 1.27(g)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//aia_d0e316949.html##aia_d0e317215)**  requires that a notification of loss of entitlement to small entity status be in the form of a specific written notification, rather than only payment of the undiscounted fee. See **[MPEP § 509.03(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//ch500_d2e7d5_13c38_20d.html)**. Similarly, **[37 CFR 1.29(i)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//ar_d1fc9c_19092_1c8.html##ar_d1fc9c_19802_31f)**  provides that notification of a loss of entitlement to micro entity status must be filed in the application or patent prior to paying, or at the time of paying, any fee after the date on which status as a micro entity is no longer appropriate. Form SB/460 "Notification of Loss of Micro Entity Status" may be used to notify the Office of a loss of entitlement to micro entity status. See **[MPEP § 509.04(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//ch500_d1ff69_271ef_147.html)** for further information regarding notifying the Office of a loss of entitlement to micro entity status, including notifying the Office of a loss of entitlement to both micro and small entity status. All notifications to the Office regarding loss of entity status must be signed by a party identified in **[37 CFR 1.33(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//aia_d0e317491.html##aia_d0e317540)**. **[37 CFR 1.366(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e327022.html##d0e327077)**  serves as a reminder to patentees of the necessity to check for the loss of small entity status prior to paying each maintenance fee on a patent. This is also a requirement of **[37 CFR 1.27(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//aia_d0e316949.html##aia_d0e317207)**. Similarly **[37 CFR 1.29(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//aia_d0e316949.html##aia_d0e317207)**  serves as a reminder of the necessity to check for the loss of micro entity status prior to paying any fee in the micro entity amount.

If status as a small or micro entity has been previously established by filing an assertion of small entity status or certification of micro entity status, and such status is checked and found to be proper, no notification is required. It is not necessary to file a new assertion establishing small or micro entity status at this point if the status as a small or micro entity has been established and is still proper. After establishing small or micro entity status, it is not necessary to file a new assertion of small entity status or certification of micro entity status, even if rights have been transferred from one small entity to another, or from one micro entity to another. The requirement is to notify the Office of the loss of entitlement and to pay the maintenance fee in the proper amount, where appropriate.

## III.    **PAYMENTS NOT MATCHING THE ENTITY STATUS OF RECORD**

If a payment is submitted that conflicts with the Office record of the patentee’s entity status, a notice relating to entity status will be sent to the fee submitter. An Overpayment Notice will be sent if Office records indicate establishment of an entity status (small or micro) entitling the patentee to a reduction in the fee amount submitted. An Underpayment Notice will be sent if Office records indicate that the patentee has not established entitlement to the entity status (small or micro) corresponding to the discounted amount submitted.

Where an Overpayment Notice is sent, the required reply depends on whether the entity status of record is correct. If the patentee determines entitlement to the entity status of record no longer exists or cannot be verified, the appropriate loss of entitlement notification must be filed. See **[37 CFR 1.27(g)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//aia_d0e316949.html##aia_d0e317215)**  regarding notification of loss of entitlement to small entity status. See **[37 CFR 1.29(i)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//ar_d1fc9c_19092_1c8.html##ar_d1fc9c_19802_31f)**  regarding notification of loss of entitlement to micro entity status. The loss of entitlement notification must be filed by mail, facsimile, or via the USPTO patent electronic filing system because the online payment system cannot accept entity status documents. A non-extendable ONE MONTH period from the mailing date of the notice will be provided for filing a notification of loss of entitlement to small or micro entity status. However, if additional money is required to complete an undiscounted payment of the maintenance fee and any required surcharge under **[37 CFR 1.362(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e326870.html##d0e326947)**, the reply (including the additional money and the loss of entity status entitlement notice) must be filed within the earlier of: (A) the non-extendable ONE MONTH period from the mailing date of the notice; or (B) any time remaining under **[37 CFR 1.362](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e326870.html)**, including the grace period provided by **[37 CFR 1.362(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e326870.html##d0e326947)**. Absent a timely reply to the Overpayment Notice, the Office will apply the maintenance fee in the reduced amount corresponding to the entity status of record and refund the overpayment amount. Accordingly, if the patentee is actually entitled to the entity status of record, no reply to the Overpayment Notice is necessary.

Where an Underpayment Notice is sent, the required reply depends on whether the entity status of record is correct. If the patentee determines that the entity status of record is correct, the reply including the additional money required for a sufficient payment in the correct higher amount, including any necessary surcharge under **[37 CFR 1.362(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e326870.html##d0e326954)**, must be timely filed. If the patentee determines the entity status of record is not correct, the reply must include any additionally required money including any necessary surcharge under **[37 CFR 1.362(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e326870.html##d0e326954)**, and the appropriate entity status document (e.g., written assertion of small entity status under **[37 CFR 1.27](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//aia_d0e316949.html)**  or certification of micro entity status under **[37 CFR 1.29](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//ar_d1fc9c_19092_1c8.html)** ). The entity status document must be filed by mail, facsimile, or via the USPTO patent electronic filing system because the online payment system (i.e., the Patent Maintenance Fees Storefront (**[https://fees.uspto.gov/Maintenance Fees](https://fees.uspto.gov/MaintenanceFees)** )) cannot accept entity status documents. Whether or not the entity status of record is correct, the reply must be filed within the earlier of: (A) a non-extendable ONE MONTH period from the mailing date of the notice; or (B) any time remaining under **[37 CFR 1.362](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e326870.html)**, including the grace period provided by **[37 CFR 1.362(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e326870.html##d0e326947)**. Note that if a previously unpaid surcharge under **[37 CFR 1.362(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e326870.html##d0e326947)**  has come due by the time the reply is filed, sufficient payment will require payment of the surcharge as well as any additional money required to complete the required maintenance fee amount. Absent a timely reply to the Underpayment Notice, the Office will return the amount received. If the amount received was returned, payment of the maintenance fee and any necessary surcharge in the correct amount must be filed within the time remaining under **[37 CFR 1.362](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e326870.html)**, including the grace period provided by **[37 CFR 1.362(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e326870.html##d0e326947)**. Note that an entity status document may also be required to be filed with the payment in order to establish what the correct amount is (e.g., if the patentee determines that the entity status of record is not correct). If the payment was returned and there is no time remaining in the grace period provided by **[37 CFR 1.362(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e326870.html##d0e326947)**, a petition under **[37 CFR 1.378](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e327126.html)**  for acceptance of a delayed maintenance fee payment must be filed in order to seek acceptance of an unintentionally delayed maintenance fee. See **[MPEP § 2590](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e249289.html)**.

# 2560    Revocation of Power of Attorney and Withdrawal of Attorney [R-07.2015]

The revocation or withdrawal of an attorney may be submitted at any time; however, a revocation or withdrawal of an attorney filed after issuance of a patent is not normally processed.

It should be noted that an assignment does not act as a revocation of power of attorney for authorization previously given. However, the assignee may revoke a previous power of attorney. See **[37 CFR 3.71](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e336679.html)**  and **[3.73](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e336732.html)**.

# 2570    Maintenance Fee Payment Status Requests [R-08.2017]

The Maintenance Fee Branch will respond to requests for the maintenance fee payment status of patents. Maintenance fee status information for a patent of interest can be obtained over the internet by entering the patent number and the corresponding application number in the appropriate spaces on the webpage available at **[https://fees.uspto.gov/ MaintenanceFees](https://fees.uspto.gov/MaintenanceFees)**. In addition, maintenance fee status can be requested by telephone. Telephone status requests are limited to two patent numbers per telephone call. See **[MPEP § 1730](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e163385.html)** for the telephone number.

# 2571-2574    [Reserved]

# 2575    Notices [R-01.2024]

Under the statutes and the regulations, the Office has no duty to notify patentees when their maintenance fees are due. It is the responsibility of the patentee to ensure that the maintenance fees are paid to prevent expiration of the patent. The Office will, however, provide some notices as reminders that maintenance fees are due, but the notices, errors in the notices or in their delivery, or the lack or tardiness of notices will in no way relieve a patentee from the responsibility to make timely payment of each maintenance fee to prevent the patent from expiring by operation of law. The notices provided by the Office are courtesies in nature and intended to aid patentees. The Office’s provision of notices in no way shifts the burden of monitoring the time for paying maintenance fees on patents from the patentee to the Office.

## I.    **STANDARD NOTICES**

The patent grant currently includes a reminder notice that maintenance fees may be due. The Notice of Allowance currently includes a reminder notice that maintenance fees may be due.

## II.    **OFFICIAL GAZETTE NOTICE**

A notice will appear in each issue of the _Official Gazette_ which will indicate which patents have been granted 3, 7, and 11 years earlier, that the window period has opened, and that maintenance fee payments will now be accepted for those patents.

Another _Official Gazette_ notice published after expiration of the grace period will indicate any patent which has expired due to nonpayment of maintenance fees and any patents which have been reinstated. An annual compilation of such expirations and reinstatements will also be published.

## III.    **MAINTENANCE FEE REMINDERS**

Since patentees are expected to maintain their own record and docketing systems and since it is expected that most patentees will pay their maintenance fees during the window period to avoid payment of a surcharge, the Office will not send any reminder notices to the patentee until after the grace period has begun. This will reduce and simplify the mailing of notices but still give patentees an opportunity to pay their maintenance fee with surcharge during the grace period before expiration of their patents. The Office will mail any Maintenance Fee Reminder to the fee address as set forth in **[37 CFR 1.363](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e326984.html)**. See **[MPEP § 2540](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e248803.html)**.

## IV.    **RECEIPT NOTICES**

Upon request, the Office will issue a receipt for payment of maintenance fees submitted by mail or facsimile after entry of the maintenance fee payment. Such a receipt, which is sent to the fee address (if no fee address, then the correspondence address), will provide an opportunity for the patentee or fee submitter to check if the Office has properly credited the payment.

## V.    **EXPIRATION NOTICES**

The Office will mail a Notice of Patent Expiration to the fee address as set forth in **[37 CFR 1.363](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e326984.html)**  when Office records indicate that a patent has expired for failure to pay a required maintenance fee.

# 2580    Review of Decision Refusing to Accept and Record Payment of a Maintenance Fee Filed Prior to Expiration of Patent [R-10.2019]

#### _37 C.F.R. 1.377   Review of decision refusing to accept and record payment of a maintenance fee filed prior to expiration of patent._

- (a) Any patentee who is dissatisfied with the refusal of the Patent and Trademark Office to accept and record a maintenance fee which was filed prior to the expiration of the patent may petition the Director to accept and record the maintenance fee.
- (b) Any petition under this section must be filed within two months of the action complained of, or within such other time as may be set in the action complained of, and must be accompanied by the fee set forth in **[§ 1.17(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//eff_20130320_d0e315199.html)**. The petition may include a request that the petition fee be refunded if the refusal to accept and record the maintenance fee is determined to result from an error by the Patent and Trademark Office.
- (c) Any petition filed under this section must comply with the requirements of **[§ 1.181(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e324913.html##d0e324949)**  and must be signed by an attorney or agent registered to practice before the Patent and Trademark Office, or by the patentee, the assignee, or other party in interest.

**[37 CFR 1.377](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e327097.html)**  provides a mechanism for review of a decision refusing to accept and record payment of a maintenance fee filed prior to the expiration of a patent. **[37 CFR 1.377(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e327097.html)**  permits a patentee who is dissatisfied with the refusal of the Office to accept and record a maintenance fee which was filed prior to the expiration of the patent to petition the Director to accept and record the maintenance fee. This petition may be used, for example, in situations where an error is present in the identifying data required by **[37 CFR 1.366(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e327022.html)**  with the maintenance fee payment, i.e., either the patent number or the application number is incorrect. See **[MPEP § 2515](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e248359.html)** and **[§ 2530](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e248646.html)**. A petition under **[37 CFR 1.377](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e327097.html)**  would not be appropriate where there is a complete failure to include at least one correct mandatory identifier as required by **[37 CFR 1.366(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e327022.html)**  for the patent since no evidence would be present as to the patent on which the maintenance fee was intended to be paid. If the maintenance fee payment with an incorrect mandatory identifier was made near the end of the grace period, the patent might expire since the Office would not credit the fee to the patent. A petition under **[37 CFR 1.377](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e327097.html)**  would not be appropriate where the patentee paid a maintenance fee on one patent when the patentee intended to pay the maintenance fee on a different patent but through error identified the wrong patent number and application number. Likewise, a petition under **[37 CFR 1.377](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e327097.html)**  would not be appropriate where the entire maintenance fee payment, including any necessary surcharge, was not filed prior to expiration of the patent.

Any petition filed under **[37 CFR 1.377](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e327097.html)**  must be filed within 2 months of the action complained of, or within such other time as may be set in the action complained of. The petition must be accompanied by the proper petition fee (**[37 CFR 1.17(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//eff_20130320_d0e315199.html)** ). The petition may include a request that the petition fee be refunded if the refusal to accept and record the maintenance fee is determined to have resulted from an error by the Office.

Any petition filed under **[37 CFR 1.377](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e327097.html)**  must comply with the requirements of **[37 CFR 1.181(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e324913.html)**  and must be signed by an attorney or agent registered to practice before the Office, or by the patentee, the assignee, or other party in interest. A person or organization whose only responsibility insofar as the patent is concerned is the payment of a maintenance fee is not a party in interest for purposes of **[37 CFR 1.377](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e327097.html)**. If the petition is signed by a person not registered to practice before the Office, the petition must indicate whether the person signing the petition is the patentee, assignee, or other party in interest. An assignee must comply with the requirements of **[pre-AIA 37 CFR 3.73(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e336732.html)**, for applications filed prior to September 16, 2012 or **[37 CFR 3.73(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//aia_d0e336732.html##aia_d0e336784)**  for applications filed on or after September 16, 2012, which are discussed in **[MPEP §§ 324](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e19816.html)** and **[325](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//ch300_d1fdcf_1b3c0_2e5.html)**, respectively.

# 2590    Acceptance of Delayed Payment of Maintenance Fee in Expired Patent to Reinstate Patent [R-01.2024]

#### _37 C.F.R. 1.378   Acceptance of delayed payment of maintenance fee in expired patent to reinstate patent._

- (a) The Director may accept the payment of any maintenance fee due on a patent after expiration of the patent if, upon petition, the delay in payment of the maintenance fee is shown to the satisfaction of the Director to have been unintentional. If the Director accepts payment of the maintenance fee upon petition, the patent shall be considered as not having expired, but will be subject to the conditions set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 41(c)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e301581.html)**.
- (b) Any petition to accept an unintentionally delayed payment of a maintenance fee must include:
    - (1) the required maintenance fee set forth in **[§ 1.20(e) through (g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e316217.html##d0e316346)**;
    - (2) the petition fee as set forth in **[§ 1.17(m)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//eff_20130320_d0e315199.html##eff_20130320_d0e315732)**; and
    - (3) A statement that the delay in payment of the maintenance fee was unintentional. The Director may require additional information where there is a question whether the delay was unintentional.
- (c) Any petition under this section must be signed in compliance with **[§ 1.33(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//aia_d0e317491.html##aia_d0e317540)**.
- (d) Reconsideration of a decision refusing to accept a delayed maintenance fee may be obtained by filing a petition for reconsideration within two months of the decision, or such other time as set in the decision refusing to accept the delayed payment of the maintenance fee.
- (e) If the delayed payment of the maintenance fee is not accepted, the maintenance fee will be refunded following the decision on the petition for reconsideration, or after the expiration of the time for filing such a petition for reconsideration, if none is filed.

**[37 CFR 1.378(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e327126.html)**  provides that the Director of the Office may accept the payment of any maintenance fee due on a patent based on an expiration of the patent if, upon petition, the delay in payment of the maintenance fee is shown to the satisfaction of the Director of the Office to have been unintentional. See subsection I below for explanation. The appropriate petition fee set forth in **[37 CFR 1.17(m)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//eff_20130320_d0e315199.html##eff_20130320_d0e315732)**  must be paid as a condition of accepting payment of the maintenance fee. If multiple maintenance fees due on a single patent have not been paid, a separate petition fee is required for each delayed maintenance fee payment. A statement that the delay in payment of the maintenance fee was unintentional is also required with respect to each delayed maintenance fee payment (a delay of more than two years after the date of nonpayment of a maintenance fee requires additional information of the facts and circumstances surrounding the entire delay to support a conclusion that the entire delay was indeed ‘‘unintentional.’’). See _Clarification of the Practice for Requiring Additional Information in Petitions Filed in Patent Applications and Patents Based on Unintentional Delay,_ 85 FR 12222-24 (March 2, 2020). While the patentee can include the statements of unintentional delay in a single petition (if desired), a separate petition fee is required for each delayed maintenance fee payment. If the Director of the Office accepts payment of the maintenance fee upon petition, the patent shall be considered as not having expired but will be subject to the intervening rights and provisions of **[35 U.S.C. 41(c)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e301581.html)**.

Any petition under **[37 CFR 1.378(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e327126.html)**  should be marked on the front page of the communication to the attention of the Office of Petitions and addressed as follows:

**[37 CFR 1.378(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e327126.html##d0e327191)**  provides a mechanism for obtaining reconsideration of a decision refusing to accept a maintenance fee upon petition filed pursuant to paragraph (a). This mechanism is a petition for reconsideration which may be filed within 2 months of, or such other time as set in, the decision refusing to accept the delayed payment of the maintenance fee. The decision on the petition for reconsideration, may provide that no further reconsideration or review of the matter will be undertaken by the Director of the Office. The maintenance fee submitted will be refunded if the delayed payment of the maintenance fee is not accepted. The refund will be made following the decision on the petition for reconsideration if the decision provides that no further reconsideration or review of the matter will be undertaken, or, upon request, after the expiration of the time for filing a petition for reconsideration, if none is filed.

## I.    **UNINTENTIONAL DELAY**

See **[MPEP § 711.03(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e81972.html)** for a general discussion of the "unintentional" delay standard.

In addition to the timeliness deadline set forth in the preceding paragraph, a petition filed under the unintentional standard of **[37 CFR 1.378(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e327126.html)**  must include:

- (A) the required maintenance fee set forth in **[37 CFR 1.20(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e316217.html##d0e316346)**  through **[(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e316217.html##ar_d20034_1e03d_380)**;
- (B) the petition fee set forth in **[37 CFR 1.17(m)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//eff_20130320_d0e315199.html##eff_20130320_d0e315732)**; and
- (C) a statement that the delay in payment of the maintenance fee was unintentional.

A person seeking reinstatement of an expired patent should not make a statement that the delay in payment of the maintenance fee was unintentional unless the entire delay was unintentional, including the period from discovery that the maintenance fee was not timely paid until payment of the maintenance fee. See _Rembrandt Technologies LP v. Comcast of Fla./Pa., LP_, 899 F.3d 1254, 1273, 127 USPQ2d 1826, 1838 (Fed. Cir. 2018). For example, a statement that the delay in payment of the maintenance fee was unintentional would not be proper when the patentee becomes aware of an unintentional failure to timely pay the maintenance fee and then intentionally delays filing a petition for reinstatement of the patent under **[37 CFR 1.378](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e327126.html)**. While the Office reserves the right to request additional information whenever there is a question as to whether the delay is unintentional, a person filing a petition seeking reinstatement of an expired patent more than two years after the date of expiration for nonpayment of a maintenance fee is required to provide additional explanation of the circumstances surrounding the delay that establishes that the entire delay was unintentional. See also **[MPEP § 711.03(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e81972.html)** for further discussion of the "unintentional" delay standard.

When a petition to accept unintentionally delayed payment of a maintenance fee in an expired patent is filed no more than two years from the date the patent expired, the petition may be automatically processed and immediately decided using the web-based ePetition process via the UPSTO patent electronic filing system. If the ePetition process is not available or desired, petitioner should use PTO/SB/66 form found on the USPTO forms website at **[www.uspto.gov/PatentForms](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/www.uspto.gov/PatentForms)**  to file a petition to accept unintentionally delayed payment of a maintenance fee in an expired patent. The petition will be processed by the Office of Petitions.

# 2591    Intervening Rights in Reinstated Patents [R-08.2012]

Intervening rights in reinstated patents are provided by **[35 U.S.C. 41(c)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e301581.html)**  which is reproduced in **[MPEP § 2501](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e247906.html#//d0e247910.html)**. No patent, the term of which has been maintained as a result of the acceptance of a late payment of a maintenance fee, shall abridge or affect the right of any person or his or her successors in business who made, purchased, imported, or used after the 6-month grace period but prior to the acceptance of the late maintenance fee anything protected by the patent, to continue the use or importation of, or to sell to others to be used or sold, the specific things made, purchased, imported, or used. A court before which such matter is in question may provide for the continued manufacture, use, importation, or sale of the thing made, purchased, imported, or used as specified, or for the manufacture, use, importation, or sale of which substantial preparation was made after the 6-month grace period but before the acceptance of the late maintenance fee, and it may also provide for the continued practice of any process, practiced, or for the practice of which substantial preparation was made, after the 6-month grace period but prior to the acceptance of the late maintenance fee, to the extent and under such terms as the court deems equitable for the protection of investments made or business commenced after the 6-month grace period but before the acceptance of the late maintenance fee.
