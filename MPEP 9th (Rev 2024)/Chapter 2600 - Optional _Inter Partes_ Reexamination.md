# 2601    Introduction [R-01.2024]

The optional _inter partes_ reexamination procedure was added to the existing _ex parte_ reexamination procedure on November 29, 1999 in the American Inventors Protection Act of 1999 (the AIPA), Public Law 106-113, app. I, title IV, 113 Stat. 1501, 1501A-552 through 1501A-591. **[Sections 311](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e249708.html#//d0e306631.html)**  – **[318](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e249708.html#//d0e306840.html)**  of title 35 of the United States Code were added by the AIPA and were subsequently amended on November 2, 2002 by Public Law 107-273, div. C, title III, subtitles A and B, 116 Stat. 1758, 1899 through 1906. The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (the AIA), Public Law 112-29, 125 Stat. 284, was enacted on September 16, 2011 and replaced the optional _inter partes_ reexamination procedure with the _inter partes_ review process. Pursuant to the AIA, the Office does not accept requests for _inter partes_ reexamination filed on or after September 16, 2012 (see **[37 CFR 1.913(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e249708.html#//d0e334822.html##ar_d1b14e_2317e_95)** ), but instead accepts petitions to conduct _inter partes_ review. For any _inter partes_ reexamination filed prior to September 16, 2012, the provisions of **[35 U.S.C. 311](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e249708.html#//d0e306631.html)**  – **[35 U.S.C. 318](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e249708.html#//d0e306840.html)**  as they were in effect prior to September 16, 2012 continue to apply to the _inter partes_ reexamination proceedings.

Guidance on the optional _inter partes_ reexamination procedure is no longer being reproduced in the Manual of Patent Examining Procedure (MPEP). For more information on the former practice, see revision 07.2022 of the 9th Edition of the MPEP.

The _ex parte_ reexamination option is still available. See **[MPEP §§ 2209](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e249708.html#//d0e221775.html)** to **[2296](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e249708.html#//d0e237508.html)** for guidance on the procedures for _ex parte_ reexamination proceedings.
