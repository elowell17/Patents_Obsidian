# 1601    Introduction: The Act, Scope, Type of Plants Covered [R-01.2024]

The right to a plant patent stems from:

#### _35 U.S.C. 161   Patents for plants._

Whoever invents or discovers and asexually reproduces any distinct and new variety of plant, including cultivated sports, mutants, hybrids, and newly found seedlings, other than a tuber propagated plant or a plant found in an uncultivated state, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions and requirements of this title.

The provisions of this title relating to patents for inventions shall apply to patents for plants, except as otherwise provided.

Asexually propagated plants are those that are reproduced by means other than from seeds, such as by the rooting of cuttings, by layering, budding, grafting, inarching, apomictic seeds, bulbs, division, slips, rhizomes, runners, corms, tissue culture, nucellar embryos, etc. Plants capable of sexual reproduction are not excluded from consideration if they have also been asexually reproduced.

With reference to tuber propagated plants, for which a plant patent cannot be obtained, the term "tuber" is used in its narrow horticultural sense as meaning a short, thickened portion of an underground branch. Such plants covered by the term "tuber propagated" include the Irish potato and the Jerusalem artichoke. This exception is made because this group alone, among asexually reproduced plants, is propagated by the same part of the plant that is sold as food. S. Rep. No. 71-315, at 5 (1930).

The term "plant" has been interpreted to mean "plant" in the ordinary and accepted sense and not in the strict scientific sense and thus excludes bacteria. _In re Arzberger,_ 112 F. 2d 834, 46 USPQ 32 (CCPA 1940). The term "plant" thus does not include asexual propagating material, _per se._ _Ex parte Hibberd,_ 227 USPQ 443, 447 (Bd. Pat. App. & Int. 1985). A "plant" in its ordinary meaning includes: a living plant organism which expresses a set of characteristics determined by its single, genetic makeup or genotype, which can be duplicated through asexual reproduction, but cannot otherwise be "made" or "manufactured." This ordinary meaning includes cultivated sports, mutants, hybrids, or transformed plants, where sports or mutants may be spontaneous or induced, and hybrids may be natural, from a planned breeding program, or somatic in source. While natural plant mutants might have naturally occurred, they must have been discovered in a cultivated area. Algae and macro-fungi are also regarded as plants.

Invention for purposes of a plant patent is a two-step process:

- 1) Discovery involves the identification of a novel plant in any cultivated area, involves the identification or recognition of an off­type plant in a monoculture of a known variety or the identification of a desirable mutant which was either spontaneous or induced, or results from the identification or recognition of an outstanding individual within the progeny of a cross made in a planned breeding program .
- 2) Asexual reproduction, including observation of the resulting propagules or clones for a sufficient amount of time to have concluded that such specimens are identical to the parent plant in all characteristics, which tests the stability and uniformity of the claimed plant to assure that the plant's unique characteristics are not due to disease, infection, or exposure to agents which cause a change in the plant's appearance which is transitory and not due to a change in the genotype of the plant.

Each of the above steps must be satisfied before filing a plant application. Filing of an application before the second step of invention has been completed will result in rejection of the claim as being premature and nonstatutory.

**[35 U.S.C. 161](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e304416.html)**  originated as an amendment to the pre-existing patent statute with the Plant Patent Act of 1930. As enacted, the "invents or discovers" requirement limited patent protection to plants "that were created as a result of plant breeding or other agricultural and horticultural efforts and that were created by the inventor." _In re Beineke,_ 690 F.3d 1344, 1352, 103 USPQ2d 1872, 1877 (Fed. Cir. 2012). The plant patent provisions were separated from the utility patent provisions in the Patent Act of 1952 to create **[35 U.S.C. 161](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e304416.html)**. _Id._ at 1348 n.2, 103 USPQ2d 1875 n.2. **[35 U.S.C. 161](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e304416.html)**  was amended in 1954 to extend protection to "newly found seedlings," provided they were found in a cultivated state, but did not otherwise alter the scope of plant patent protection. _Id._ at 1352-53, 103 USPQ2d at 1878-79. In _Beineke,_ the Federal Circuit held that two century-old oak trees found on the lawn of a home were ineligible for patent protection under **[35 U.S.C. 161](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e304416.html)**  because they were not created from inception by human activity and created by the inventor as required by the 1930 Act, nor were they "newly found seedlings" under the 1954 amendment. _Id._ at 1348, 1352, 103 USPQ2d at 1875, 1879.

In reviewing the history of the Plant Patent Act, the Supreme Court explained:

> Prior to 1930, two factors were thought to remove plants from patent protection. The first was the belief that plants, even those artificially bred, were products of nature for purposes of the patent law…. The second obstacle to patent protection for plants was the fact that plants were thought not amenable to the "written description" requirement of the patent law. See 35 U.S.C. § 112. … In enacting the Plant Patent Act, Congress addressed both of these concerns. It explained at length its belief that the work of the plant breeder "in aid of nature" was patentable invention. S. Rep. No. 315, 71st Cong., 2d Sess., 6-8 (1930); H.R. Rep. No. 1129, 71st Cong., 2d Sess., 7-9 (1930). And it relaxed the written description requirement in favor of "a description … as complete as is reasonably possible." 35 U.S.C. § 162.

_Diamond v. Chakrabarty,_ 447 U.S. 303, 311-312, 206 USPQ 193 (1980).

An asexually reproduced plant may alternatively be protected under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e302376.html)**, provided the written description requirement can be satisfied. See **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e302824912.html)**. In _J.E.M. Ag Supply, Inc. v. Pioneer Hi-Bred Int’l, Inc.,_ the Supreme Court held that patentable subject matter under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e302376.html)**  includes newly developed plants, even though plant protection is also available under the Plant Patent Act (**[35 U.S.C. 161](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e304416.html)** -**[164](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e304454.html)** ) and the Plant Variety Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 2321 et. seq.). _J.E.M. Ag Supply, Inc. v. Pioneer Hi-Bred Int’l, Inc.,_ 534 U.S. 124, 143-46, 122 S.Ct. 593, 605-06, 60 USPQ2d 1865, 1874 (2001) (The scope of coverage of **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e302376.html)**  is not limited by the Plant Patent Act or the Plant Variety Protection Act; each statute has different requirements and protections). An application filed under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e302376.html)**  may claim the same asexually reproduced plant that is claimed under **[35 U.S.C. 161](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e304416.html)**, as well as plant materials and processes involving plant materials. See **[MPEP § 2105](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e197008.html)**.

The filing of a terminal disclaimer may be used in appropriate situations to overcome an obviousness-type double patenting rejection based on claims to the asexually reproduced plant and/or fruit and propagating material thereof in an application under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e302376.html)**  and the claim to the same asexually reproduced plant in an application under **[35 U.S.C. 161.](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e304416.html)** 

#### _35 U.S.C. 163   Grant._

In the case of a plant patent, the grant shall include the right to exclude others from asexually reproducing the plant, and from using, offering for sale, or selling the plant so reproduced, or any of its parts, throughout the United States, or from importing the plant so reproduced, or any parts thereof, into the United States.

As provided in **[35 U.S.C. 161](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e304416.html)**, the rights associated with a plant patent include the rights associated with a utility patent, and the "right to exclude" has additional terms provided in **[35 U.S.C. 163](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e304443.html)**.

A plant patent is regarded as limited to one plant, or genome. A plant derived from a sport or a mutant is unlikely to have the same genome as the original plant, and thus would not be covered by the plant patent to the original plant. Such plant derived from a sport or a mutant may itself be protected under a separate plant patent, subject to meeting the requirements of patentability.

A plant patent issuing from an application filed after June 7, 1995 has a term which expires 20 years after the filing date of the application, or any earlier filing date claimed under **[35 U.S.C. 120](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e303023313.html)**, **[121](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e303040.html)**  or **[365(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e307034.html)**. See **[MPEP § 2701](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e271945.html)**. Plant patent applications are examined with respect to the same statutory provisions as other national applications (see **[MPEP § 1608](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e162045.html)**) and will be published pursuant to **[35 U.S.C. 122(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e303054.html##d0e303063)**. See **[MPEP § 324](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e19816.html)** (for applications filed before September 16, 2012), **[325](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//ch300_d1fdcf_1b3c0_2e5.html)** (for applications filed on or after September 16, 2012), or **[402](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e20563.html)** for information on legal representation in patent applications.

_[Editor Note: Applicable only to patent applications filed under 35 U.S.C. 111(a) or 363 on or after September 16, 2012.]_

The inventor named for a plant patent application must be the person who has invented or discovered and asexually reproduced the new and distinct variety of plant for which a patent is sought. The inventor's oath or declaration, in addition to the averments required by **[§ 1.63](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//aia_d0e319759.html)**  or **[§ 1.64](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//aia_d0e319924.html)**, must state that the inventor has asexually reproduced the plant. Where the plant is a newly found plant, the inventor's oath or declaration must also state that it was found in a cultivated area.

#### _37 C.F.R. 1.162 (pre-AIA).   Applicant, oath or declaration._

_[Editor Note: **Not applicable** to patent applications filed under 35 U.S.C. 111(a) or 363 on or after September 16, 2012.]_

The applicant for a plant patent must be the person who has invented or discovered and asexually reproduced the new and distinct variety of plant for which a patent is sought (or as provided in §§ 1.42, 1.43 and 1.47). The oath or declaration required of the applicant, in addition to the averments required by § 1.63, must state that he or she has asexually reproduced the plant. Where the plant is a newly found plant, the oath or declaration must also state that it was found in a cultivated area.

The inventor's oath or declaration, in addition to the averments required by **[37 CFR 1.63](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//aia_d0e319759.html)**  or **[37 CFR 1.64](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//aia_d0e319924.html)**, (or, for applications filed before September 16, 2012, **[pre-AIA 37 CFR 1.63](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e319759.html)** ) must state that the inventor has asexually reproduced the plant. Where the plant is a newly found plant, the inventor's oath or declaration must also state that it was found in a cultivated area.

A Plant Patent Application (**[35 U.S.C. 161](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e304416.html)** ) Declaration, Form PTO/AIA/09, may be used to submit a declaration in a plant application filed on or after September 16, 2012. See **[MPEP § 602.01(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//ch600_d1ff64_29e5e_a0.html)**.

**[35 U.S.C. 100(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e302338313.html##d0e302367313)**  defines the term "inventor" as the individual or, if a joint invention, the individuals collectively who invented or discovered the subject matter of the invention. In an application for a plant patent, there can be joint inventors, as there may be multiple steps in developing a plant invention. For example, if one person discovered a new and distinct plant and asexually reproduced the plant, such person would be a sole inventor. If one person discovered or selected a new and distinct plant, and a second person asexually reproduced the plant and ascertained that the clone(s) of the plant were identical to the original plant in every distinguishing characteristic, the second person would properly be considered a joint inventor. See _Ex parte Kluis,_ 70 USPQ 165 (Bd. App. 1945). If a group of staff or collaborators contributed to the final plant invention, everyone would be considered joint inventors. However, an inventor may direct that the step of asexual reproduction be performed by a custom propagation service or tissue culture enterprise. Those performing the service would not be considered joint inventors.

#### _37 C.F.R. 1.164   Claim._

The claim shall be in formal terms to the new and distinct variety of the specified plant as described and illustrated, and may also recite the principal distinguishing characteristics. More than one claim is not permitted.

The specification should include a complete detailed description of the plant and the characteristics thereof that distinguish the same over related known varieties, and its antecedents, expressed in botanical terms in the general form followed in standard botanical textbooks or publications dealing with the varieties of the kind of plant involved (evergreen tree, dahlia plant, rose plant, apple tree, etc.), rather than a mere broad nonbotanical characterization such as commonly found in nursery or seed catalogs. The specification should also include the origin or parentage and the genus and species designation of the plant variety sought to be patented. The Latin name of the genus and species of the plant claimed should be stated and preceded by the heading set forth in **[37 CFR 1.163(c)(4)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e324410.html)**. The specification must particularly point out where, e.g., location or place of business, and in what manner the variety of plant has been asexually reproduced.

Form Paragraphs 16.01, 16.09, and 16.10 may be used to object to the disclosure under **[37 CFR 1.163(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e324410.html)**.

# ¶ 16.01    Specification, Manner of Asexually Reproducing

The application is objected to under **[37 CFR 1.163(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e324410.html)**  because the specification does not "particularly point out where and in what manner the variety of plant has been asexually reproduced." Correction is required.

# ¶ 16.09    Specification, Less Than Complete Description

The disclosure is objected to under **[37 CFR 1.163(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e324410.html)**  because the specification presents less than a full and complete botanical description and the characteristics which distinguish over related known varieties. More specifically: **[1]**.

# ¶ 16.10    Specification, Location of Plant Not Disclosed

The disclosure is objected to under **[37 CFR 1.163(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e324410.html)**  because the specification does not particularly point out the location and character of the area where the plant was discovered.

Where color is a distinctive feature of the plant, the color should be positively identified in the specification by reference to a designated color as given by a recognized color dictionary or color chart.

Form Paragraphs 16.02 and 16.03 may be used to object to the disclosure or reject the claim, respectively, because of a lack of a clear and complete disclosure with regard to colors.

# ¶ 16.02    Colors Specified Do Not Correspond With Those Shown

The disclosure is objected to under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e302824.html)**, first paragraph, because the **[1]** colors specified fail to correspond with those shown.

# ¶ 16.03    Rejection, 35 U.S.C. 112(a) or pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112, 1st Paragraph, Non-Support for Colors

The claim is rejected under **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**  or **[pre-AIA 35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e302824.html)**, first paragraph, as being unsupported by a clear and complete disclosure with regard to **[1]** colors, for the following reasons: **[2]**.

If the written description of a plant is deficient in certain respects (see, e.g., _In re Greer,_ 484 F.2d 488, 179 USPQ 301 (CCPA 1973)), a clarification or additional description of the plant, or even a wholesale substitution of the original description so long as not totally inconsistent and unrelated to the original description and photograph of the plant may be submitted in reply to an Office action. Such submission will not constitute new matter under **[35 U.S.C. 132](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e303187.html)**. _Jessel v. Newland,_ 195 USPQ 678, 684 (Dep. Comm’r Pat. 1977).

The rules on Deposit of Biological Materials, **[37 CFR 1.801](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e333189.html)** -**[1.809](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e333576.html)**, do not apply to plant patent applications in view of the reduced disclosure requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 162](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e304430.html)**, even where a deposit of a plant has been made in conjunction with a utility application (**[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e302376.html)** ).

A plant patent is granted only on the entire plant. Only one claim is necessary and only one is permitted. A method claim in a plant patent application is improper. An example of a proper claim would be "A new and distinct variety of hybrid tea rose plant, substantially as illustrated and described herein."

# 1606    Drawings [R-01.2024]

#### _37 C.F.R. 1.165   Plant drawings._

- (a) Plant patent drawings should be artistically and competently executed and must comply with the requirements of **[§ 1.84](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e320999.html)**. View numbers and reference characters need not be employed unless required by the examiner. The drawing must disclose all the distinctive characteristics of the plant capable of visual representation.
- (b) The drawings may be in color. The drawing must be in color if color is a distinguishing characteristic of the new variety. Two copies of color drawings or photographs must be submitted.

If the drawings, including watercolor renderings, or photographs are in color, two color copies of each drawing or photograph are required. If the required copies of the drawings are not included, the application will be accorded a filing date, but correction will be required before the application is forwarded for examination.

#### _37 C.F.R. 1.84   Standards for drawings._

*****

- (c) __Identification of drawings.__ Identifying indicia should be provided, and if provided, should include the title of the invention, inventor’s name, and application number, or docket number (if any) if an application number has not been assigned to the application. If this information is provided, it must be placed on the front of each sheet within the top margin. Each drawing sheet submitted after the filing date of an application must be identified as either "Replacement Sheet" or "New Sheet" pursuant to § **[1.121(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e323020.html)**. If a marked-up copy of any amended drawing figure including annotations indicating the changes made is filed, such marked-up copy must be clearly labeled as "Annotated Sheet" pursuant to § **[1.121(d)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e323020.html)**.

*****

- (e) _Type of paper._ Drawings submitted to the Office must be made on paper which is flexible, strong, white, smooth, non-shiny, and durable. All sheets must be reasonably free from cracks, creases, and folds. Only one side of the sheet may be used for the drawing. Each sheet must be reasonably free from erasures and must be free from alterations, overwritings, and interlineations. Photographs must be developed on paper meeting the sheet-size requirements of paragraph (f) of this section and the margin requirements of paragraph (g) of this section. See paragraph (b) of this section for other requirements for photographs.
- (f) _Size of paper._ All drawing sheets in an application must be the same size. One of the shorter sides of the sheet is regarded as its top. The size of the sheets on which drawings are made must be:
    
    - (1) 21.0 cm. by 29.7 cm. (DIN size A4), or
    - (2) 21.6 cm. by 27.9 cm. (8 1/2 by 11 inches).
- (g) _Margins._ The sheets must not contain frames around the sight (_i.e.,_ the usable surface), but should have scan target points (_i.e.,_ cross-hairs) printed on two cater-corner margin corners. Each sheet must include a top margin of at least 2.5 cm. (1 inch), a left side margin of at least 2.5 cm. (1 inch), a right side margin of at least 1.5 cm. (5/8 inch), and a bottom margin of at least 1.0 cm. (3/8 inch), thereby leaving a sight no greater than 17.0 cm. by 26.2 cm. on 21.0 cm. by 29.7 cm. (DIN size A4) drawing sheets, and a sight no greater than 17.6 cm. by 24.4 cm. (6 15/16 by 9 5/8 inches) on 21.6 cm. by 27.9 cm. (8 1/2 by 11 inch) drawing sheets.

*****

- (i) _Arrangement of views._ One view must not be placed upon another or within the outline of another. All views on the same sheet should stand in the same direction and, if possible, stand so that they can be read with the sheet held in an upright position. If views wider than the width of the sheet are necessary for the clearest illustration of the invention, the sheet may be turned on its side so that the top of the sheet, with the appropriate top margin to be used as the heading space, is on the right-hand side. Words must appear in a horizontal, left-to-right fashion when the page is either upright or turned so that the top becomes the right side, except for graphs utilizing standard scientific convention to denote the axis of abscissas (of X) and the axis of ordinates (of Y).

*****

- (t) _Numbering of sheets of drawings._ The sheets of drawings should be numbered in consecutive Arabic numerals, starting with 1, within the sight as defined in paragraph (g) of this section. These numbers, if present, must be placed in the middle of the top of the sheet, but not in the margin. The numbers can be placed on the right-hand side if the drawing extends too close to the middle of the top edge of the usable surface. The drawing sheet numbering must be clear and larger than the numbers used as reference characters to avoid confusion. The number of each sheet should be shown by two Arabic numerals placed on either side of an oblique line, with the first being the sheet number and the second being the total number of sheets of drawings, with no other marking.
- (u) _Numbering of views._
    
    - (1) The different views must be numbered in consecutive Arabic numerals, starting with 1, independent of the numbering of the sheets and, if possible, in the order in which they appear on the drawing sheet(s). Partial views intended to form one complete view, on one or several sheets, must be identified by the same number followed by a capital letter. View numbers must be preceded by the abbreviation "FIG." Where only a single view is used in an application to illustrate the claimed invention, it must not be numbered and the abbreviation "FIG." must not appear.
    - (2) Numbers and letters identifying the views must be simple and clear and must not be used in association with brackets, circles, or inverted commas. The view numbers must be larger than the numbers used for reference characters.

*****

- (x) _Holes._ No holes should be made by applicant in the drawing sheets.

Form Paragraphs 16.06, 16.07, and 16.11 may be used to object to the drawing disclosure.

# ¶ 16.06    Color Drawings Must Be in Duplicate

The disclosure is objected to under **[37 CFR 1.165(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e324521.html)**  because applicant has not provided copies of the color drawing in duplicate. Correction is required.

# ¶ 16.07    Drawing Figures Not Competently Executed

The disclosure is objected to under **[37 CFR 1.165(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e324521.html)**  because Fig. **[1]** not artistically and/or competently executed.

# ¶ 16.11    Drawings in Improper Scale

The disclosure is objected to under **[37 CFR 1.165(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e324521.html)**  because the drawings are of an inadequate scale to show the distinguishing features of the plant.

# 1607    Specimens [R-08.2012]

#### _37 C.F.R. 1.166   Specimens._

The applicant may be required to furnish specimens of the plant, or its flower or fruit, in a quantity and at a time in its stage of growth as may be designated, for study and inspection. Such specimens, properly packed, must be forwarded in conformity with instructions furnished to the applicant. When it is not possible to forward such specimens, plants must be made available for official inspection where grown.

Specimens of the plant variety, its flower or fruit, should not be submitted unless specifically called for by the examiner.

Form Paragraph 16.13 may be used to require specimens.

# ¶ 16.13    Specimens Are Required

Applicant **[1]** required to submit **[2]** in accordance with **[37 CFR 1.166](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e324543.html)**.

# 1608    Examination [R-11.2013]

Plant applications are subject to the same examination process as any other national application. As such, the statutory provisions with regard to patentable subject matter, utility, novelty, obviousness, disclosure, and claim specificity requirements apply (**[35  U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e302376.html)**, **[102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e302383.html)**, **[103](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e302450.html)**, and **[112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e302824.html)** ). The sole exception in terms of applicability of these statutory provisions is set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 162](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e304430.html)**.

The prior art considered by the examiner is developed by a search of appropriate subclasses of the United States patent classification system as well as patent and nonpatent literature data bases. Where appropriate, a report may be obtained from the Agricultural Research Service, Horticultural Research Branch, Department of Agriculture. See **[MPEP § 1609](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e162098.html)**.

# 1609    Report of Agricultural Research Service [R-01.2024]

#### _35 U.S.C. 164   Assistance of Department of Agriculture._

The President may by Executive order direct the Secretary of Agriculture, in accordance with the requests of the Director, for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of this title with respect to plants (1) to furnish available information of the Department of Agriculture, (2) to conduct through the appropriate bureau or division of the Department research upon special problems, or (3) to detail to the Director officers and employees of the Department.

#### _37 C.F.R. 1.167   Examination._

Applications may be submitted by the Patent and Trademark Office to the Department of Agriculture for study and report.

The authority for submitting plant applications to the Department of Agriculture for report is given in:

> _Executive Order No. 5464, October 17, 1930. Facilitating the consideration of applications for plant patents._
> 
> I, Herbert Hoover, President of the United States of America, under the authority conferred upon me by act of May 23, 1930 (Public No. 245) [now **[35 U.S.C. 164](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e304454.html)** ], entitled "An act to provide for plant patents," and by virtue of all other powers vested in me relating thereto, do hereby direct the Secretary of Agriculture: (1) to furnish the Commissioner of Patents such available information of the Department of Agriculture, or (2) to conduct through the appropriate bureau or division of the department such research upon special problems, or (3) to detail to the Commissioner of Patents such officers and employees of the department, as the Commissioner may request for the purpose of carrying said act into effect.

Where the examiner considers it necessary to the examination of the plant patent application, a copy of the file and drawing of the application are forwarded to the National Program Leader for Horticultural Crops, Agricultural Research Service (ARS), U.S. Department of Agriculture, along with a request for a report as to whether the plant variety disclosed is new and distinct over known plant varieties. As the report is merely advisory to the Office, it is placed in the file but is not given a paper number. The copy of the report is customarily utilized by the examiner in the preparation of an action on the application.

The report may embody criticisms and objections to the disclosure, may offer suggestions for correction of such, or the report may merely state that:

> "Examination of the specification submitted indicates that the variety described is not identical with others with which our specialists are familiar."

# 1610    The Action [R-01.2024]

The action on the application by the examiner will include all matters as provided for in other types of patent applications. See **[37 CFR 1.161](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e324375.html)**.

With reference to the examination of the claim, the language must be such that it is directed to the "new and distinct variety of plant." This is important as under no circumstance should the claim be directed to a new variety of flower or fruit in contradistinction to the plant bearing the flower or the tree bearing the fruit. This is in spite of the fact that it is accepted and general botanical parlance to say "A variety of apple or a variety of blackberry" to mean a variety of apple tree or a variety of blackberry plant.

Where the application is otherwise allowable, a claim which recites, for example "A new variety of apple characterized by," may be amended by the insertion of - tree - after "apple" by an examiner’s amendment.

By the same token, the title of the invention must relate to the entire plant and not to its flower or fruit, thus: Apple Tree, Rose Plant.

Care should also be exercised that the specification does not contain unwarranted advertising, for example, "the disclosed plant being grown in the XYZ Nurseries of Topeka, Kansas." It follows, also, that in the drawings any showing in the background of a plant, as a sign carrying the name of an individual, nursery, etc., is objectionable and deletion thereof is required. Nor should the specification include laudatory expressions, such as, "The rose is prettier than any other rose." Such expressions are wholly irrelevant. Where the fruit is described, statements in the specification as to the character and quality of products made from the fruit are not necessary and should be deleted.

The Office action may include so much of any report of the ARS as the examiner deems necessary, or may embody no part of it. In the event of an interview, the examiner, at their discretion, may show the entire report to the inventor or attorney.

Form Paragraph 16.12 may be used to reference portions of the ARS report.

# ¶ 16.12    Report From U.S. Dept. of Agriculture

This application has been submitted to the U.S. Department of Agriculture for a report. Pertinent portions follow: **[1]**

The report of the ARS is not in the nature of a publication and matters raised therein within the personal knowledge of the specialists of the ARS are not sufficient basis for a rejection unless it is first ascertained by the examiner that the same can be supported by affidavits by said specialists (**[37 CFR 1.104(d)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e322124.html)** ). See _Ex parte Rosenberg,_ 46 USPQ 393 (Bd. App. 1939).

Form Paragraphs 16.04 and 16.08, as appropriate, may be used to reject the claim.

# ¶ 16.04    Rejection, 35 U.S.C. 102

The claim is rejected under **[35 U.S.C. 102](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e302383.html)**  as failing to patentably distinguish over **[1]**.

# ¶ 16.08    Rejection, 35 U.S.C. 112

The claim is rejected under **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e302824.html)**  **[1]** because **[2]**.

# 1611    Issue [R-11.2013]

The preparation of a plant patent application for issue involves the same procedure as for other applications (**[37 CFR 1.161](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e324375.html)** ), with the exception that where there are color drawings, the better one of the two judged, for example, by its sharpness or cleanliness is selected to be printed in the patent.

The International Patent Classification symbols, most recent edition, should be placed on the Issue Classification form of all plant patent applications being sent to issue.

All plant patent applications should contain an abstract when allowed.

# 1612    UPOV Convention [R-11.2013]

The International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (generally known by its French acronym as "UPOV Convention") was adopted on December 2, 1961, by a Diplomatic Conference held in Paris.

The UPOV Convention has been revised on November 10, 1972, on October 23, 1978, and on March 19, 1991, in order to reflect technological developments in plant breeding and experience acquired with the application of the UPOV Convention. As of December 5, 2012, 71 states and organizations were party to the UPOV Convention.

![List of members of the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/graphics/E9_R-01.2024/1612-1.png "List of members of the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants")

Most states adhere to either the 1978 text or the 1991 text. The United States adheres to the 1991 text, and has a reservation under Article 35(2) of the text (which allows plant patents rather than breeder’s rights certificates to be granted).

The 1961, 1978, and 1991 texts guarantee to plant breeders in each member state both national treatment and the right of priority in all other member states. In many states, new plant varieties are protected by breeders’ rights laws rather than patent laws. Accordingly, the Paris (Industrial Property) Convention cannot always be relied on to provide these and other rights.

Insofar as the patenting of asexually reproduced plants in the United States is concerned, both national treatment and the right of priority have been accorded to foreign plant breeders since enactment of the plant patent law in 1930 (now **[35 U.S.C. 161](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e304416.html)** -**[164](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e304454.html)** ). See **[MPEP § 1613](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e162350.html)** for the right of priority based upon an application for plant breeder’s rights.

Application of the UPOV Convention in the United States does not affect the examination of plant patent applications, except in one instance. It is now necessary as a condition for receiving a plant patent to register a variety denomination for that plant. Inclusion of the variety denomination in the patent comprises its registration. The registration process in general terms consists of inclusion of a proposed variety denomination in the plant patent application. The examiner must evaluate the proposed denomination in light of UPOV Convention, Article 13. Basically, this Article requires that the proposed variety denomination not be identical with or confusingly similar to other names utilized in the United States or other UPOV member countries for the same or a closely related species. In addition, the proposed denomination must not mislead the average consumer as to the characteristics, value, or identity of the patented plant. Ordinarily, the denomination proposed for registration in the United States must be the same as the denomination registered in another member state of UPOV.

Pursuant to **[37 CFR 1.76(b)(3)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//aia_d0e320348.html##aia_d0e320395)**, the Latin name and the variety denomination for the plant claimed may be included in an application data sheet (ADS). The Office, pursuant to the UPOV Convention, has been asked to compile a database of the plants patented and the database must include the Latin name and the variety denomination of each patented plant. Having this information in an ADS will make the process of compiling this database more efficient.

Form Paragraph 16.05 may be used to object to the disclosure as lacking a common or market name or "denomination" of the plant.

# ¶ 16.05    Name or Denomination for Plant Missing

The disclosure is objected to under **[37 CFR 1.121(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e323020.html)**  because no "variety denomination" of the instant plant has been set forth in the disclosure. **[37 CFR 1.163(c)(4)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e324410.html)**. Correction by adding such a name is required.

# ¶ 16.05.01    Latin Name of Genus and Species of the Plant Claimed Missing

The disclosure is objected to under **[37 CFR 1.121(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e323020.html)**  because the Latin name of the genus and species of the instant plant has not been set forth in the disclosure. **[37 CFR 1.163(c)(4)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e161282.html#//d0e324410.html)**. Correction by adding such a name is required.
