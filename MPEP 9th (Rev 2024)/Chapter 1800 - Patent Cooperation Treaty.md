# INTRODUCTION [R-07.2022]

This chapter is designed to be a guide for patent examiners in searching and examining applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT). Applicants desiring additional information for filing international applications should obtain a copy of the PCT Applicant’s Guide from the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) in Geneva, Switzerland.

The Articles and Regulations under the PCT are reproduced in Appendix T of this Manual and the Administrative Instructions are reproduced in Appendix AI of this Manual. The text of the _PCT Applicant’s Guide,_ the monthly _PCT Newsletter,_ the weekly _PCT Gazette,_ downloadable PCT forms, and additional information about the processing of international applications are available from WIPO’s website (**[www.wipo.int](http://www.wipo.int/)** ).

PCT applications are processed by the Office of PCT Operations within the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

# 1801    Basic Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) Principles [R-01.2024]

## I.    **MAJOR CONCEPTS OF THE PCT**

The Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) enables the U.S. applicant to file one application, "an international application," in a standardized format in English in the U.S. Receiving Office (the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office), and have that application acknowledged as a regular national or regional filing in as many Contracting States to the PCT as the applicant "designates," i.e., names, as countries or regions in which patent protection is desired. The filing of an international application will automatically constitute the designation of all contracting countries to the PCT on that filing date. In the same manner, the PCT enables foreign applicants to file a PCT international application, designating the United States of America, in their home language in their home patent office and have the application acknowledged as a regular U.S. national filing. The PCT also provides for the establishment of an international search report and written opinion at 16 months from the priority date and publication of the international application after 18 months from the priority date. Upon payment of national fees and the furnishing of any required translation, usually 30 months after the filing of any priority application for the invention, or the international filing date if no priority is claimed, the application will be subjected to national procedures for granting of patents in each of the designated countries. For any countries remaining whose national laws are not compatible with the 30 month period set forth in **[PCT Article 22(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363665.html##d0e363673)**, the filing of a demand for an international preliminary examination electing such countries within 19 months from the priority date will result in an extension of the period for entering the national stage to 30 months from the priority date. An up-to-date list of such countries may be found on WIPO’s website (**[www.wipo.int/ pct/en/texts/reservations/res_incomp.html](http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts/reservations/res_incomp.html)** ). See also subsection V. below. A brief description of the basic flow under the PCT is provided in **[MPEP § 1842](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e171994.html)**.

The PCT offers an alternative route to filing patent applications directly in the patent offices of those countries which are Contracting States of the PCT. It does not preclude taking advantage of the priority rights and other advantages provided under the Paris Convention and the WTO administered Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS Agreement). The PCT provides an additional and optional foreign filing route to patent applicants.

The filing, search and publication procedures are provided for in Chapter I of the PCT. Additional procedures for a preliminary examination of PCT international applications are provided for in optional PCT Chapter II.

In most instances, a national U.S. application is filed first. An international application for the same subject matter will then be filed subsequently within the priority year provided by the Paris Convention and the priority benefit of the U.S. national application filing date will be claimed.

## II.    **RECEIVING OFFICE (RO)**

The international application (IA) must be filed in the prescribed receiving Office (RO)(**[PCT Article 10](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363227.html)** ). The United States Patent and Trademark Office will act as a receiving Office for United States residents and nationals (**[35 U.S.C. 361(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e306949.html)** ). Under **[PCT Rule 19.1(a)(iii)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e368498.html##d0e368505)**, the International Bureau of the World Intellectual Property Organization will also act as a Receiving Office for U.S. residents and nationals. The receiving Office functions as the filing and formalities review organization for international applications. International applications must contain upon filing the designation of at least one Contracting State in which patent protection is desired and must meet certain standards for completeness and formality (**[PCT Articles 11(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363237.html)**  and **[14(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363352.html)** ).

Where a priority claim is made, the date of the earliest-filed application whose priority is claimed is used as the date for determining the timing of international processing, including the various transmittals, the payment of certain international and national fees, and publication of the application. Where no priority claim is made, the international filing date will be considered to be the "priority date" for timing purposes (**[PCT Article 2(xi)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e362923.html)** ).

The international application is subject to the payment of certain fees within 1 month from the date of receipt. See **[PCT Rules 14.1(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e367979.html##d0e368002)**, **[15.3](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e368006.html##d0e368057)**, and **[16.1(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e368100.html##d0e368138)**. The receiving Office will grant an international filing date to the application, collect fees, handle informalities by direct communication with the applicant, and monitor all corrections (**[35 U.S.C. 361(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e306949.html)** ). By 13 months from the priority date, the receiving Office should prepare and transmit a copy of the international application, called the search copy (SC), to the International Searching Authority (ISA); and forward the original, called the record copy (RC), to the International Bureau (IB) (**[PCT Rules 22.1](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e369206.html##d0e369213)**  and **[23](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e369309.html)** ). A second copy of the international application, the home copy (HC), remains in the receiving Office (**[PCT Article 12(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363301.html)** ). Once the receiving Office has transmitted copies of the application, the International Searching Authority becomes the focus of international processing.

## III.    **INTERNATIONAL SEARCHING AUTHORITY (ISA)**

The basic functions of the International Searching Authority (ISA) are to conduct a prior art search of inventions claimed in international applications (it does this by searching in at least the minimum documentation defined by the Treaty (**[PCT Articles 15](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363418.html)**  and **[16](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363461.html)**  and **[PCT Rule 34](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e370400.html)** )) and to issue a written opinion (**[PCT Rule 43bis](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e370901.html)**  ) which will normally be considered to be the first written opinion of the International Preliminary Examining Authority where international preliminary examination is demanded. See **[PCT Rule 66.1bis](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e374653.html##d0e374660)**.

For most applications filed with the United States Receiving Office, the applicant may choose (in the Request form) the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the European Patent Office, the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the Australian Patent Office (IP Australia), the Israel Patent Office (ILPO), the Japan Patent Office (JPO), or the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS) to act as the International Searching Authority. However, IP Australia and JPO may not be competent to act as an International Searching Authority for certain applications filed by nationals or residents of the United States. See **[MPEP §§ 1840.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e171588.html)** - **[1840.07](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//ch1800_d298ed_29d3d_331.html)**. The International Searching Authority is also responsible for checking the content of the title and abstract (**[PCT Rules 37.2](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e370627.html##d0e370644)**  and **[38.2](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e370660.html##d0e370677)** ).

An international search report (ISR) and written opinion will normally be issued by the International Searching Authority within 3 months from the receipt of the search copy (usually about 16 months after the priority date) (**[PCT Rule 42](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e370881.html)** ). Copies of the international search report and prior art cited will be made available to the applicant by the ISA (**[PCT Rules 43](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e370901.html)**  and **[44.1](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e371252.html##d0e371259)** ). The international search report will contain a listing of documents found to be relevant and will identify the claims in the application to which they are pertinent. The written opinion indicates whether each claim appears to satisfy the **[PCT Article 33](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364085.html)**  criteria of "novelty," "inventive step," and "industrial applicability." The written opinion may also indicate defects in the form or content of the international application under the PCT articles and regulations, as well as any observations the ISA wishes to make on the clarity of the claims, the description, and the drawings, or on the question of whether the claims are fully supported by the description.

Once the international search report and written opinion are established, the ISA transmits one copy of each to the applicant and the International Bureau, and international processing continues before the International Bureau. If a Demand for Chapter II examination is not timely filed, the International Bureau communicates a copy of the written opinion established by the ISA (retitled International Preliminary Report on Patentability (Chapter I of the PCT)) to each designated Office after the expiration of 30 months from the priority date.

## IV.    **INTERNATIONAL BUREAU (IB)**

The basic functions of the International Bureau (IB) are to maintain the master file of all international applications and to act as the publisher and central coordinating body under the Treaty. The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) in Geneva, Switzerland performs the duties of the International Bureau.

If the applicant has not filed a certified copy of the priority document in the receiving Office with the international application, requested upon filing that the receiving Office prepare and transmit to the International Bureau a copy of the prior U.S. national application, the priority of which is claimed, or requested the International Bureau to obtain a copy of the earlier application from a digital library, the applicant must submit such a document directly to the International Bureau or the receiving Office not later than 16 months after the priority date (**[PCT Rule 17](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e368311.html)** ). The request (Form PCT/RO/101) contains a box which can be checked requesting the receiving Office to prepare and transmit a copy of a prior application. This is only possible, of course, if the receiving Office is a part of the same national Office where the priority application was filed. The request (Form PCT/RO/101) also contains a box which can be checked requesting the International Bureau to obtain a copy of the earlier application from a digital library. This is only possible if the application is registered in a digital library, made available to the International Bureau within the prescribed time limit, as set forth in **[PCT Rule 17.1(b-bis)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e368311.html##at_d24d84_23240_230)**, and the access code is furnished to the International Bureau.

The applicant has normally 2 months from the date of transmittal of the international search report to amend the claims by filing an amendment and may file a brief statement explaining the amendment directly with the International Bureau (**[PCT Article 19](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363565.html)**  and **[PCT Rule 46](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e371568.html)** ). The International Bureau will then normally publish the international application along with the search report and any amended claims at the expiration of 18 months from the priority date (**[PCT Article 21](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363622.html)** ). For applications filed before July 1, 2014, former PCT Rule 44_ter_ provided that the written opinion of the ISA would not be made publicly available until the expiration of 30 months from the priority date. For applications filed on or after July 1, 2014, the written opinion of the ISA and any informal comments submitted by the applicant are made available to the public in their original language as of the publication date. The international publication includes a front page containing bibliographical data, the abstract, and a figure of the drawing (**[PCT Rule 48](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e371853.html)** ). The publication also contains the search report and any amendments to the claims submitted by the applicant. If the application is published in a language other than English, the search report and abstract are also published in English. The International Bureau publishes a _PCT Gazette_ in the French and English languages which contains information similar to that on the front pages of published international applications, as well as various indexes and announcements (**[PCT Rule 86](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e376690.html)** ). The International Bureau also communicates copies of the publication of the international application to all designated Offices that have requested to receive the publication (**[PCT Article 20](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363585.html)**, **[PCT Rule 47](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e371652.html)**, and **[PCT Rule 93bis.1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e378072.html)**.

## V.    **DESIGNATED OFFICE (DO) and ELECTED OFFICE (EO)**

The designated Office is the national Office (for example, the USPTO) acting for the state or region designated under Chapter I. Similarly, the elected Office is the national Office acting for the state or region elected under Chapter II.

**[PCT Article 22(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363665.html)**  was amended, effective April 1, 2002, to specify that a copy of the international application, a translation thereof (as prescribed), and the national fee are due to the designated Office not later than at the expiration of 30 months from the priority date. Accordingly, the time period for filing the copy of the international application, the translation, and the fee under **[PCT Article 22](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363665.html)**  is the same as the 30 month time period set forth in **[PCT Article 39](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364336.html)**. The USPTO has adopted the 30 month time limit set forth in **[PCT Article 22(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363665.html)**. Most Contracting States have changed their national laws for consistency with **[PCT Article 22(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363665.html)**  as amended. An up-to-date listing of Contracting States that have adopted **[Article 22(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363665.html)**  as amended is maintained at WIPO’s website at **[www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts/ time_limits.html](http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts/time_limits.html)**. At the time of publication of this Chapter, only two countries have not adopted **[Article 22(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363665.html##d0e363673)**  as amended: Luxembourg (LU) and the United Republic of Tanzania (TZ). It is noted that Luxembourg is included in the regional designation "EPO" and that the United Republic of Tanzania is included in the regional designation "ARIPO." For those two remaining Contracting States that have not adopted **[Article 22(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363665.html)**  as amended, if no "Demand" for international preliminary examination has been filed within 19 months of the priority date, the applicant may be required to complete the requirements for entering the national stage within 20 months from the priority date of the international application in the national offices of those states. When entering the national stage following Chapter I or Chapter II, the applicant has the right to amend the application within the time limit set forth in **[PCT Rule 52.1](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e373259.html##d0e373266)**  or **[PCT Rule 78.1](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e376093.html##d0e376100)**, respectively. After this time limit has expired (**[PCT Article 28](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363856.html)**  or **[PCT Article 41](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364395.html)**  and **[PCT Rule 52](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e373259.html)**  or **[PCT Rule 78](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e376093.html)** ), each designated/elected Office will make its own determination as to the patentability of the application based upon its own specific national or regional laws (**[PCT Article 27(5)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363805.html)** ).

If the applicant desires to obtain the benefit of delaying the entry into the national stage until 30 months from the priority date in one or more countries where the 30 month time limit set forth in **[PCT Article 22(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363665.html)**  as amended does not apply, a Demand for international preliminary examination must be filed with an appropriate International Preliminary Examining Authority (IPEA) within 19 months of the priority date.

Those states in which the Chapter II procedure is desired must be "elected" in the Demand.

**[PCT Rule 54bis.1](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e373594.html##d0e373603)**  requires the Demand to be made prior to the expiration of whichever of the following periods expires later:

- (A) three months from the date of transmittal to the applicant of the international search report or of the declaration referred to in **[PCT Article 17(2)(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363501.html##d0e363514)**, and of the written opinion under **[PCT Rule 43bis.1](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e370901.html)**; or
- (B) 22 months from the priority date.

However, applicant may desire to file the Demand by 19 months from the priority date to extend the national stage entry deadline in Luxembourg and the United Republic of Tanzania.

The original Demand is forwarded to the International Bureau by the IPEA. The International Bureau then notifies the various elected Offices that the applicant has entered Chapter II and sends a copy of any amendments filed under **[PCT Article 19](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363565.html)**  and any statement explaining the amendments and the basis for the amendments to the IPEA. See **[PCT Rule 62](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e374402.html)**. The International Bureau also sends the IPEA a copy of the written opinion established by the International Searching Authority (ISA) unless the ISA is also acting as the IPEA. See **[PCT Rule 62.1(i)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e374402.html##d0e374412)**.

## VI.    **INTERNATIONAL PRELIMINARY EXAMINING AUTHORITY (IPEA)**

The International Preliminary Examining Authority (IPEA) normally starts the examination process when it is in possession of:

- (A) the Demand;
- (B) the amount due;
- (C) a translation, if the applicant is required to furnish a translation under **[PCT Rule 55.2](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e373640.html##d0e373660)**;
- (D) either the international search report or a notice of the declaration by the International Searching Authority (ISA) that no international search report will be established; and
- (E) the written opinion established under **[PCT Rule 43bis.1](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e371120.html##d0e371129)**.

The IPEA shall start the international preliminary examination upon receipt of the above materials unless the applicant expressly requests to postpone the start of the international preliminary examination until the expiration of the later of three months from the transmittal of the international search report (or declaration that no international search report will be established) and written opinion; or the expiration of 22 months from the priority date, with the exception of the situations provided for in **[PCT Rule 69.1(b) - (e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e375165.html##d0e375172)**.

The written opinion of the ISA is usually considered the first written opinion of the IPEA unless the IPEA has notified the International Bureau that written opinions established by specified International Searching Authorities shall not be considered a written opinion for this purpose. See **[PCT Rule 66.1bis](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e374653.html##d0e374660)**. Also, the IPEA may, at its discretion, issue further written opinions provided sufficient time is available. See **[PCT Rule 66.4](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e374653.html##d0e374874)**.

The IPEA establishes the international preliminary examination report (entitled "international preliminary report on patentability"), which presents the examiner’s final position as to whether each claim is "novel," involves "inventive step," and is "industrially applicable" by 28 months from the priority date. A copy of the international preliminary examination report is sent to the applicant and to the International Bureau. The International Bureau then communicates a copy of the international preliminary examination report to each elected Office.

The applicant must complete the requirements for entering the national stage by the expiration of 30 months from the priority date to avoid any question of withdrawal of the application as to that elected Office; however, some elected Offices provide a longer period to complete the requirements.

A listing of all national and regional offices, and the corresponding time limits for entering the national stage after PCT Chapter I and PCT Chapter II, may be found on WIPO’s website at: **[www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts/time_limits.html](http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts/time_limits.html)**.

# 1803    Reservations Under the PCT Taken by, and Notifications of Incompatibility Made by, the United States of America [R-07.2022]

The United States of America had originally declared that it was not bound by Chapter II (**[PCT Article 64(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e365412.html)** ), but withdrew that reservation on July 1, 1987.

It has also declared that, as far as the United States of America is concerned, international publication is not required (**[PCT Article 64 (3)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e365412.html)** ). Accordingly, under **[PCT Article 64(3)(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e365412.html##d0e365463)**, if the United States is the only PCT Contracting State designated in an international application, the international application will not be published by the International Bureau (IB) at 18 months. Even though the United States Patent and Trademark Office has pre-grant publication under **[35 U.S.C. 122(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e303054.html)**, the United States has not removed its reservation under **[PCT Article 64(3)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e365412.html)**  because not all United States patent applications are published. See **[35 U.S.C. 122(b)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e303054.html)**. The application will, however, be published under **[35 U.S.C. 122(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e303054.html)**  if it enters the national stage in the United States. It will be published again if it is allowed to issue as a United States patent. This reservation is still in effect.

The U.S. Receiving Office continues to accept applications only in English. See **[35 U.S.C. 361(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e306949.html)**. **[PCT Rules 20.1(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e368649.html##d0e368656)**, **[26.3ter(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e369418.html##d0e369582)**  and **[26.3ter(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e369418.html##d0e369624)**  permit an international filing date to be accorded even though portions of an international application are in a language not acceptable to the Receiving Office. **[PCT Rules 20.1(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e368649.html##d0e368656)**, **[26.3ter(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e369418.html##d0e369582)**  and **[26.3ter(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e369418.html##d0e369624)**  are not compatible with the national law applied by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) as receiving Office. Thus, the USPTO has made a notification of incompatibility with respect to these rules pursuant to **[PCT Rules 20.1(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e368649.html##d0e368656)**, **[26.3ter(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e369418.html##d0e369620)**  and **[26.3ter(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e369418.html##d0e369649)**. As a result, **[PCT Rules 20.1(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e368649.html##d0e368656)**, **[26.3ter(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e369418.html##d0e369582)**  and **[26.3ter(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e369418.html##d0e369624)**  shall not apply to the USPTO as receiving Office for as long as the aforementioned incompatibility exists.

See **[MPEP § 1806](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//ch1800_d1ffcb_1d71d_75.html)** as to who can file an international application.

Only if at least one of the applicants is a resident or national of the United States of America may an international application be filed in the United States Receiving Office. See **[PCT Article 9(1) and (3)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363201.html)**, **[PCT Rules 19.1](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e368498.html##d0e368505)**  and **[19.2](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e368498.html##d0e368543)**, **[35 U.S.C. 361(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e306949.html)**  and **[37 CFR 1.412(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e327307.html)**  and **[1.421](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e327684.html)**. The concepts of residence and nationality are defined in **[PCT Rule 18.1](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e368425.html##d0e368432)**.

International applications may be filed electronically through the USPTO patent electronic filing system. International applications and related papers may also be deposited with the United States Receiving Office by addressing the papers to "Mail Stop PCT" and hand-delivering them to the Office. See **[MPEP § 501](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e24257.html)**, subsection III for information regarding hand-delivery of papers. The mailing address for delivery by the U.S. Postal Service is: Mail Stop PCT, Commissioner for Patents, P.O. Box 1450, Alexandria, Virginia 22313-1450. It should be noted that the Priority Mail Express® provisions of **[37 CFR 1.10](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e313951.html)**  apply to the filing of all applications and papers filed in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, including PCT international applications and related papers and fees. It should be further noted, however, that PCT international applications and papers relating to international applications are specifically excluded from the Certificate of Mailing or Transmission procedures under **[37 CFR 1.8](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e313726.html)**. See **[MPEP § 1834](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e170737.html)**, subsection III. If **[37 CFR 1.8](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e313726.html)**  is improperly used, the date to be accorded the paper will be the date of actual receipt in the Office unless the receipt date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or federal holiday in which case the date of receipt will be the next succeeding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or federal holiday (**[37 CFR 1.6](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e313447.html)** ).

Irrespective of the Certification practice under **[37 CFR 1.8(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e313726.html)**, facsimile transmission (without the benefit of the certificate under **[37 CFR 1.8(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e313726.html)** ) may be used to submit certain papers in international applications. However, facsimile transmission may not be used for the filing of an international application, the filing of color drawings under **[37 CFR 1.437](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e328126.html)**, or the filing of a copy of the international application and the basic national fee to enter the U.S. national stage under **[35 U.S.C. 371](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e307164.html)**. See **[37 CFR 1.6(d)(3)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e313447.html)**  and **[(4)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e313447.html##d0e313529)**, **[1.8(a)(2)(i)(D)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e313726.html)**, and **[1.8(a)(2)(i)(F)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e313726.html)**. The Demand for international preliminary examination may be filed by facsimile transmission. See **[MPEP § 1834.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e170909.html)**.

The United States Receiving Office and PCT Help Desk are available to offer guidance on PCT requirements and procedures. See **[MPEP § 1730](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e163385.html)** for information on contacting the staff and other available means for obtaining information.

**WARNING** - although the United States patent law at **[35 U.S.C. 21(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e301434.html)**  authorizes the Director to prescribe by rule that any paper or fee required to be filed in the Patent and Trademark Office will be considered filed in the Office on the date on which it was deposited with the United States Postal Service, **[PCT Rule 20.1(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e368649.html##d0e368656)**  provides for marking the "date of actual receipt on the request." Although the Priority Mail Express® provisions under **[37 CFR 1.10](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e313951.html)**  have not been contested to date regarding PCT applications, applicants should be aware of a possible different interpretation by foreign authorities.

**[PCT Rule 19.4](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e368498.html##d0e368587)**  provides for transmittal of an international application to the International Bureau as Receiving Office in certain instances. For example, when the international application is filed with the United States Receiving Office and the language in which the international application is filed is not accepted by the United States Receiving Office, or if the applicant does not have the requisite residence or nationality, the application may be forwarded to the International Bureau for processing in its capacity as a Receiving Office. See **[37 CFR 1.412(c)(6)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e327307.html)**. The Receiving Office of the International Bureau will consider the international application to be received as of the date accorded by the United States Receiving Office. This practice will avoid the loss of a filing date in those instances where the United States Receiving Office is not competent to act, but where the international application indicates an applicant to be a national or resident of a PCT Contracting state or is in a language accepted under **[PCT Rule 12.1(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e367227.html##d0e367234)**  by the International Bureau as a Receiving Office. Where questions arise regarding residence or nationality, i.e., the U.S. is not clearly competent, the application will be forwarded to the International Bureau as Receiving Office. Note, where no residence or nationality is indicated, the U.S. is not competent, and the application will be forwarded to the International Bureau as Receiving Office so long as the necessary fee is paid. The fee is an amount equal to the transmittal fee.

If all of the applicants are indicated to be residents and nationals of non-PCT Contracting States, **[PCT Rule 19.4](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e368498.html##d0e368587)**  does not apply, and the application is denied an international filing date.

Any applicant who is a resident or national of a PCT Contracting State may also file their application directly with the International Bureau as receiving Office. An applicant may wish to consider filing directly with the International Bureau as receiving Office instead of the United States Receiving Office in the situation where applicant is filing their international application after the expiration of the 12 month priority period but within two months of the expiration of the priority period, and where applicant desires to request restoration of the right of priority under the in spite of due care standard. See **[MPEP § 1828.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e170589.html)**. An applicant may also request that an application be forwarded to the International Bureau for processing in its capacity as receiving Office in accordance with **[PCT Rule 19.4(a)(iii)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e368498.html##d0e368616)**  in situations where the international application was filed with the United States Receiving Office after the expiration of the 12 month priority period but within two months of the expiration of the priority period, and where applicant desires to request restoration of the right of priority under the in spite of due care standard. However, any transfer request received after substantial processing of the international application by the United States Receiving Office has occurred may be declined.

An international application filed with, or forwarded to, the International Bureau must have a foreign filing license unless: (1) the invention was not made in the United States; or (2) a U.S. national application on the invention was filed at least six months prior to the filing of the international application, the U.S. national application is not subject to a secrecy order under **[37 CFR 5.2](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e337176.html)**, and the international application does not contain modifications, amendments, or supplements changing the general nature of the invention in a manner that would require any corresponding United States application to be or have been available for inspection under **[35 U.S.C. 181](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e304551.html)**. See **[37 CFR 5.11](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e337342.html)**  and **[5.15](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e337491.html)**.

# 1806    Applicants and Inventors [R-07.2015]

Any resident or national of a Contracting State may file an international application. See **[PCT Article 9](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363201.html)**  and **[PCT Rule 18](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e368425.html)**. The applicant can be an individual, corporate entity or other concern. Where there are two or more applicants, at least one of them must be a national or a resident of a Contracting State.

The question of whether an applicant is a resident or national of a Contracting State depends on the national law of that State and is decided by the receiving Office. Also, possession of a real and effective industrial or commercial establishment in a Contracting State may be considered residence in that State, and a legal entity constituted according to the national law of a Contracting State is considered a national of that State.

Where the inventor is not the applicant, indications concerning the inventor must nevertheless be made in the Request where the national law of at least one of the designated States requires that the name of the inventor be furnished at the time of filing a national application (**[PCT Rule 4.1(a)(iv)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e365863.html##d0e365894)** ). See PCT Applicant’s Guide, International Phase, Annexes B1 and B2, for those States and regional patent systems which require such indications. Furthermore, information concerning the inventor is required by most countries for the national phase. In such a case, the check-box "inventor only" should be marked, the inventor’s name and address indicated in Box No. III, and the inventor’s residence and nationality omitted.

- (a) Only residents or nationals of the United States of America may file international applications in the United States Receiving Office. If an international application does not include an applicant who is indicated as being a resident or national of the United States of America, and at least one applicant:
    - (1) Has indicated a residence or nationality in a PCT Contracting State, or
    - (2) Has no residence or nationality indicated, applicant will be so notified and, if the international application includes a fee amount equivalent to that required by § **[1.445(a)(4)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e328174.html##d0e328222)**, the international application will be forwarded for processing to the International Bureau acting as a Receiving Office (see also § **[1.412(c)(6)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e327307.html##d0e327395)** ).
- (b) Although the United States Receiving Office will accept international applications filed by any resident or national of the United States of America for international processing, for the purposes of the designation of the United States, an international application must be filed, and will be accepted by the Patent and Trademark Office for the national stage only if filed, by the inventor or as provided in §§ **[1.422](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//aia_d0e327758.html)**  or **[1.423](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//aia_d0e327768.html)**. Joint inventors must jointly apply for an international application.
- (c) For the purposes of designations other than the United States, international applications may be filed by the assignee or owner.
- (d) A registered attorney or agent of the applicant may sign the international application Request and file the international application for the applicant. A separate power of attorney from each applicant may be required.
- (e) Any indication of different applicants for the purpose of different Designated Offices must be shown on the Request portion of the international application.
- (f) Requests for changes in the indications concerning the applicant, agent, or common representative of an international application shall be made in accordance with **[PCT Rule 92bis](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e378036.html)**  and may be required to be signed by all applicants.
- (g) Requests for withdrawals of the international application, designations, priority claims, the Demand, or elections shall be made in accordance with **[PCT Rule 90bis](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377369.html)**  and must be signed by all applicants. A separate power of attorney from the applicants will be required for the purposes of any request for a withdrawal in accordance with **[PCT Rule 90bis](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377369.html)**  which is not signed by all applicants. The submission of a separate power of attorney may be excused upon the request of another applicant where one or more inventors cannot be found or reached after diligent effort. Such a request must be accompanied by a statement explaining to the satisfaction of the Director the lack of the signature concerned.

#### _37 C.F.R. 1.422  (pre-AIA) When the inventor is dead._

[Editor Note: Applicable to patent applications filed under **[35 U.S.C. 363](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e306994313.html)**  before September 16, 2012]

In case of the death of the inventor, the legal representative (executor, administrator, etc.) of the deceased inventor may file an international application which designates the United States of America.

#### _37 C.F.R. 1.423  (pre-AIA) When the inventor is insane or legally incapacitated._

[Editor Note: Applicable to patent applications filed under **[35 U.S.C. 363](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e306994313.html)**  before September 16, 2012]

In case an inventor is insane or otherwise legally incapacitated, the legal representative (guardian, conservator, etc.) of such inventor may file an international application which designates the United States of America.

For international applications having international filing dates before September 16, 2012, only inventors (and legal representatives of deceased or legally incapacitated inventors) can be applicants for purposes of the designation of the United States. Therefore, for the purpose of entering the national stage in the United States of America, the inventor(s) must be indicated in the PCT Request as "applicant and inventor" for at least the United States.

A legal representative of a deceased inventor may be indicated in the international application as an applicant for the purposes of the United States. In such a case, the indication in the Request (in Box II or III, as appropriate) for the legal representative should be made as follows: SMITH, Alfred, legal representative of JONES, Bernard (deceased), followed by indications of the address, nationality and residence of the legal representative. The legal representative should be indicated as an "applicant only" except where the legal representative is also an inventor, in which case the legal representative should be indicated as an "applicant and inventor." The name of the deceased inventor should also appear in a separate box (in Box III) with the indication of "deceased" (e.g., "JONES, Bernard (deceased))" and identified as an "inventor only" and not as an applicant.

#### _37 C.F.R. 1.455  Representation in international applications._

- (a) Applicants of international applications may be represented by attorneys or agents registered to practice before the United States Patent and Trademark Office or by an applicant appointed as a common representative ( **[PCT Art. 49](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364541.html)**, **[Rules 4.8](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e365863.html##d0e366095)**  and **[90](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377138.html)**  and § **[11.9](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e350728.html)** ). If applicants have not appointed an attorney or agent or one of the applicants to represent them, and there is more than one applicant, the applicant first named in the request and who is entitled to file in the U.S. Receiving Office shall be considered to be the common representative of all the applicants. An attorney or agent having the right to practice before a national office with which an international application is filed and for which the United States is an International Searching Authority or International Preliminary Examining Authority may be appointed to represent the applicants in the international application before that authority. An attorney or agent may appoint an associate attorney or agent who shall also then be of record ( **[PCT Rule 90.1(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377138.html##d0e377145)** ). The appointment of an attorney or agent, or of a common representative, revokes any earlier appointment unless otherwise indicated ( **[PCT Rule 90.6(b) and (c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377138.html##d0e377327)** ).
- (b) Appointment of an agent, attorney or common representative (**[PCT Rule 4.8](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e365863.html##d0e366095)** ) must be effected either in the Request form, signed by applicant, in the Demand form, signed by applicant, or in a separate power of attorney submitted either to the United States Receiving Office or to the International Bureau.
- (c) Powers of attorney and revocations thereof should be submitted to the United States Receiving Office until the issuance of the international search report.
- (d) The addressee for correspondence will be as indicated in section **[108](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e278956.html)**  of the Administrative Instructions.

#### _PCT Rule 90_

#### _Agents and Common Representatives_

*****

# 90.4 Manner of Appointment of Agent or Common Representative

- (a) The appointment of an agent shall be effected by the applicant signing the request, the demand or a separate power of attorney. Where there are two or more applicants, the appointment of a common agent or common representative shall be effected by each applicant signing, at his choice, the request, the demand or a separate power of attorney.
- (b) Subject to **[Rule 90.5](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377138.html##d0e377280)**, a separate power of attorney shall be submitted to either the receiving Office or the International Bureau, provided that, where a power of attorney appoints an agent under **[Rule 90.1(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377138.html##d0e377145)**, (b-_bis_), (c), or (d)(ii), it shall be submitted to the International Searching Authority, the Authority specified for supplementary search or the International Preliminary Examining Authority, as the case may be.
- (c) If the separate power of attorney is not signed, or if the required separate power of attorney is missing, or if the indication of the name or address of the appointed person does not comply with **[Rule 4.4](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e365863.html##d0e365989)**, the power of attorney shall be considered nonexistent unless the defect is corrected.
- (d) Subject to paragraph (e), any receiving Office, any International Searching Authority, any Authority competent to carry out supplementary searches, any International Preliminary Examining Authority and the International Bureau may waive the requirement under paragraph (b) that a separate power of attorney be submitted to it, in which case paragraph (c) shall not apply.
- (e) Where the agent or the common representative submits any notice of withdrawal referred to in **[Rules 90bis.1](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377369.html##d0e377378)**  to **[90bis.4](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377369.html##d0e377490)**, the requirement under paragraph (b) for a separate power of attorney shall not be waived under paragraph (d).

*****

Where an appointment of an agent or common representative is effected by a separate power of attorney, that power of attorney must be submitted to either the receiving Office or the International Bureau. However, a power of attorney appointing an agent or subagent to represent the applicant specifically before the International Searching Authority or the International Preliminary Examining Authority must be submitted directly to that Authority. See **[PCT Rule 90.4(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377138.html##d0e377231)**.

The Customer Number Practice set forth in **[MPEP § 403](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e21586.html)** may not be used in the international phase to appoint an agent or designate a correspondence address. A power of attorney making use of the Customer Number Practice in the international phase to indicate the name or address of an appointed person will be considered nonexistent unless the defect is corrected. See **[PCT Rule 90.4(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377138.html##d0e377231)**. A Customer Number may be used in the international phase solely for purposes of viewing the international application in the USPTO patent electronic filing system. See **[MPEP § 1809](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//ch1800_d1ffca_1926f_3b5.html)**.

## I.    **"GENERAL" POWER OF ATTORNEY**

#### _PCT Rule 90_

#### _Agents and Common Representatives_

*****

# 90.5 General Power of Attorney

- (a) Appointment of an agent in relation to a particular international application may be effected by referring in the request, the demand or a separate notice to an existing separate power of attorney appointing that agent to represent the applicant in relation to any international application which may be filed by that applicant (i.e., a "general power of attorney"), provided that:
    - (i) the general power of attorney has been deposited in accordance with paragraph (b), and
    - (ii) a copy of it is attached to the request, the demand or the separate notice, as the case may be; that copy need not be signed.
- (b) The general power of attorney shall be deposited with the receiving Office, provided that, where it appoints an agent under **[Rule 90.1(b), (c) or (d)(ii)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377138.html##d0e377145)**, it shall be deposited with the International Searching Authority, the Authority specified for supplementary search or the International Preliminary Examining Authority, as the case may be.
- (c) Any receiving Office, any International Searching Authority, any Authority competent to carry out supplementary searches and any International Preliminary Examining Authority may waive the requirement under paragraph (a)(ii) that a copy of the general power of attorney is attached to the request, the demand or the separate notice, as the case may be.
- (d) Notwithstanding paragraph (c), where the agent submits any notice of withdrawal referred to in **[Rules 90bis.1](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377138.html)**  to **[90bis.4](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377138.html)**  to the receiving Office, the Authority specified for supplementary search, the International Preliminary Examining Authority or the International Bureau, as the case may be, a copy of the general power of attorney shall be submitted to that Office, Authority or Bureau.

*****

"General" powers of attorney are recognized for the purpose of filing and prosecuting an international application before the international authorities. See **[PCT Rule 90.5](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377138.html##d0e377280)**.

Any general power of attorney must be filed with the receiving Office if the appointment was for the purposes of the international phase generally, or with the International Searching Authority or International Preliminary Examining Authority if the appointment was specifically to represent the applicant before that Authority. The appointment will then be effective in relation to any particular application filed by that applicant provided that the general power of attorney is referred to in the request, the Demand or a separate notice, and that a copy of the general power of attorney is attached to that request, Demand or separate notice. That copy of the signed original need not, itself, be separately signed.

## II.    **WAIVER OF REQUIREMENT FOR A POWER OF ATTORNEY**

Pursuant to **[PCT Rules 90.4(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377138.html##d0e377231)**  and **[90.5(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377138.html##d0e377280)**, which are applicable to international applications having an international filing date on or after January 1, 2004, the receiving Office, International Bureau, International Searching Authority and International Preliminary Examining Authority may waive the requirement for a separate power of attorney or copy of the general power of attorney in all cases except with respect to notice of withdrawals under **[PCT Rule 90bis](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377138.html)**  (i.e., notices withdrawing international applications, designations, priority claims, demands or elections). The USPTO, when acting in its capacity as a receiving Office, International Searching Authority, or International Preliminary Examining Authority, will in most cases waive the requirement for a separate power of attorney and copy of the general power of attorney. However, a separate power of attorney or copy of the general power of attorney may still be required in certain cases, e.g., where an agent’s authority to act on behalf of the applicant is in doubt or where waiver could result in harm to an applicant as in the case of the removal of an applicant.

Model power of attorney and general power of attorney forms are available online from WIPO’s website (**[www.wipo.int/pct/en/index.html](http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/index.html)** ).

# 90.6 Revocation and Renunciation

- (a) Any appointment of an agent or common representative may be revoked by the persons who made the appointment or by their successors in title, in which case any appointment of a sub-agent under **[Rule 90.1(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377138.html##d0e377145)**  by that agent shall also be considered as revoked. Any appointment of a sub-agent under **[Rule 90.1(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377138.html##d0e377145)**  may also be revoked by the applicant concerned.
- (b) The appointment of an agent under **[Rule 90.1(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377138.html##d0e377145)**  shall, unless otherwise indicated, have the effect of revoking any earlier appointment of an agent made under that Rule.
- (c) The appointment of a common representative shall, unless otherwise indicated, have the effect of revoking any earlier appointment of a common representative.
- (d) An agent or a common representative may renounce his appointment by a notification signed by him.
- (e) **[Rule 90.4(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377138.html##d0e377231)**  and (c) shall apply, _mutatis mutandis_, to a document containing a revocation or renunciation under this Rule.

#### _37 C.F.R. 1.455  Representation in international applications._

- (a) Applicants of international applications may be represented by attorneys or agents registered to practice before the United States Patent and Trademark Office or by an applicant appointed as a common representative (**[PCT Art. 49](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364541.html)**  , **[Rules 4.8](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e365863.html##d0e366095)**  and **[90](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377138.html)**  and § **[11.9](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e350728.html)** ). If applicants have not appointed an attorney or agent or one of the applicants to represent them, and there is more than one applicant, the applicant first named in the request and who is entitled to file in the U.S. Receiving Office shall be considered to be the common representative of all the applicants. An attorney or agent having the right to practice before a national office with which an international application is filed and for which the United States is an International Searching Authority or International Preliminary Examining Authority may be appointed to represent the applicants in the international application before that authority. An attorney or agent may appoint an associate attorney or agent who shall also then be of record (**[PCT Rule 90.1(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377138.html##d0e377145)** ). The appointment of an attorney or agent, or of a common representative, revokes any earlier appointment unless otherwise indicated (**[PCT Rule 90.6(b) and (c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377138.html##d0e377327)** ).
- (b) Appointment of an agent, attorney or common representative (**[PCT Rule 4.8](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e365863.html##d0e366095)** ) must be effected either in the Request form, signed by applicant, in the Demand form, signed by applicant, or in a separate power of attorney submitted either to the United States Receiving Office or to the International Bureau.
- (c) Powers of attorney and revocations thereof should be submitted to the United States Receiving Office until the issuance of the international search report.
- (d) The addressee for correspondence will be as indicated in section **[108](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e278956.html)**  of the Administrative Instructions.

The appointment of an agent or a common representative can be revoked. The document containing the revocation must be signed by the persons who made the appointment or by their successors in title. The appointment of a sub-agent may also be revoked by the applicant concerned. If the appointment of an agent is revoked, any appointment of a sub-agent by that agent is also considered revoked. Also, as an agent may not be appointed by Customer Number Practice in the international phase (see **[MPEP § 1807](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e164506.html)**), an appointment of an agent may not be revoked by reference to a Customer Number.

The appointment of an agent for the international phase in general automatically has the effect, unless otherwise indicated, of revoking any earlier appointment of an agent. The appointment of a common representative similarly has the effect, unless otherwise indicated, of revoking any earlier appointment of a common representative.

Renunciation of an appointment may be made by means of a notification signed by the agent or common representative. The applicant is informed of the renunciation by the International Bureau.

The rules for signing and submission of a power of attorney set forth in **[PCT Rule 90.4(b) and (c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377138.html##d0e377231)**  also apply to a revocation or renunciation of an appointment. See **[PCT Rule 90.6(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377138.html##d0e377327)**.

U.S. attorneys or agents wishing to withdraw from representation in international applications may request to do so. To expedite the handling of requests for permission to withdraw as attorney, the request should be submitted to the International Bureau or to the receiving Office at Mail Stop PCT and should indicate the present mailing addresses of the attorney who is withdrawing and of the applicant. The Office will not accept address changes to a new practitioner or law firm absent the filing of a power of attorney to the new representative. Because the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) does not recognize law firms, each attorney of record must sign the notice of withdrawal, or the notice of withdrawal must contain a clear indication of one attorney signing on behalf of another.

In accordance with **[37 CFR 11.116](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//ar_d1fd14_19838_35a.html)**, the USPTO will usually require the practitioner(s) to certify that he, she or they have: (1) given reasonable notice to the client, prior to the expiration of the reply period, that the practitioner(s) intends to withdraw from employment; and (2) delivered to the client or a duly authorized representative of the client all papers and property (including funds) to which the client is entitled. Furthermore, as **[37 CFR 11.116](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//ar_d1fd14_19838_35a.html)**  permits withdrawal from representation before the Office for reasons set forth in **[37 CFR 11.116(a) and (b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//ar_d1fd14_19838_35a.html##ar_d1fd14_19856_202)**, if the reasons for withdrawal do not conform to one of the mandatory or permissive reasons set forth in **[37 CFR 11.116](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//ar_d1fd14_19838_35a.html)**, the Office will not approve the request.

The Office will not approve requests from practitioners to withdraw from applications where the requesting practitioner was not appointed in a power of attorney but is acting, or has acted, in a representative capacity pursuant to **[37 CFR 1.34](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e317605.html)**. In these situations, the practitioner is responsible for the correspondence the practitioner files in the application while acting in a representative capacity. As such, there is no need for the practitioner to obtain the permission of the Office to withdraw from representation.

Practitioners should note that the International Bureau will not record a change in the agent if the requested change is received by it after the expiration of 30 months from the priority date. See **[PCT Rule 92bis](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e378036.html)**. Where a request to withdraw from representation is filed with the USPTO after the expiration of this time period, the request may not be treated on the merits.

For withdrawal of attorney or agent in the national stage, see **[MPEP § 402.06](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e21157.html)**.

# 1809    Access to the USPTO patent electronic filing system [R-01.2024]

Status information relating to patent applications is available through the USPTO patent electronic filing system, which has a public view and a private view. The public view provides access to all issued patents and published patent applications. Private view allows registered Patent Center users to access information for applications associated with the user that has not been made public, in addition to what is also available through the public view. To have access to the private view, the applicant must be a registered user in Patent Center. Further information can be found at **[www.uspto.gov/NewPatentFilers](http://www.uspto.gov/NewPatentFilers)**.

To associate a new international application that is being filed via the USPTO patent electronic filing system with an existing customer number, enter the customer number in the appropriate field when filling in the application data. The customer number will allow access to the application in the USPTO patent electronic filing system but may not be used to establish or change the correspondence address.

To associate a previously filed international application to a customer number, a request must be made. Applicant must provide the customer number, international application number, registration number and signature of applicant or attorney of record. Form PTO-2248 may be obtained from the USPTO website (**[www.uspto.gov/patents-getting-started/ international-protection/patent-cooperation-treaty/ pct-chapter-i-forms](http://www.uspto.gov/patents-getting-started/international-protection/patent-cooperation-treaty/pct-chapter-i-forms)** ). The form can be mailed or transmitted by facsimile to Mail Stop EBC, Commissioner for Patents, P.O. Box 1450, Alexandria, VA 22313-1450. The fax number is 571-273-0177.

The ability to view the status of the international application on the USPTO patent electronic filing system does not allow an applicant to change the correspondence address or appoint or change an agent with the customer number. See **[MPEP § 1807](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e164506.html)**. Such a change must be made under **[PCT Rule 92bis](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e378036.html)**  through the submission of a written request to the U.S. receiving Office or the International Bureau.

The international filing, transmittal, and search fee payable is the international filing, transmittal, and search fee in effect on the receipt date of the international application. If the international filing, transmittal and search fees are not paid within one month from the date of receipt of the international application and prior to the sending of a notice of deficiency, which imposes a late payment fee (§ **[1.445(a)(6)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e328174.html##ar_it_310c5_2ca93_114)** ), the applicant will be notified and given a one month non-extendable time limit within which to pay the deficient fees plus the late payment fee.
- (d) If the payment needed to cover the transmittal fee, the international filing fee, the search fee, and the late payment fee pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section is not timely made in accordance with **[PCT Rule 16bis.1(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e368190.html##d0e368199)**, the Receiving Office will declare the international application withdrawn under **[PCT Article 14(3)(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363352.html)**.

##    **THE "INTERNATIONAL FILING DATE"**

An international filing date is accorded to the earliest date on which the requirements under **[PCT Article 11(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363237.html)**  were satisfied. If the requirements under **[PCT Article 11(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363237.html)**  are not satisfied as of the date of initial receipt of the international application papers, the receiving Office will invite applicant to correct the deficiency within a set time limit. See **[PCT Article 11(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363237.html)**  and **[PCT Rule 20.3](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e368649.html##d0e368720)**. In such case, the international filing date will be the date on which a timely filed correction is received by the receiving Office. If the defect under PCT Article **[11(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363237.html)**  is that the purported international application fails to contain a portion which on its face appears to be a description or claims, and if the application, on its initial receipt date, contained a priority claim and a proper incorporation by reference statement, the initial receipt date may be retained as the international filing date if the submitted correction was completely contained in the earlier application. See **[PCT Rules 4.18](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e365863.html##d0e366394)**  and **[20.6](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e368649.html##d0e368933)**. If the defect under **[PCT Article 11(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363237.html)**  is not timely corrected, the receiving Office will promptly notify the applicant that the application is not and will not be treated as an international application. See **[PCT Rule 20.4](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e368649.html##d0e368804)**. Where all the sheets pertaining to the same international application are not received on the same day by the receiving Office, in most instances, the date of receipt of the application will be amended to reflect the date on which the last missing sheets were received. As an amended date of receipt may cause the priority claim to be forfeited, applicants should assure that all sheets of the application are deposited with the receiving Office on the same day. If the application, on its initial receipt date, contained a priority claim and a proper incorporation by reference statement, the initial receipt date may be retained as the international filing date if the submitted correction was completely contained in the earlier application. Again see **[PCT Rules 4.18](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e365863.html##d0e366394)**  and **[20.6](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e368649.html##d0e368933)**.

An all too common occurrence is that applicants will file an international application in the U.S. Receiving Office and no applicant has a U.S. residence or nationality. Applicants are cautioned to be sure that at least one applicant is a resident or national of the U.S. before filing in the U.S. Receiving Office. Where no applicant indicated on the request papers is a resident or national of the United States, the USPTO is not a competent receiving Office for the international application under **[PCT Rule 19.1(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e368498.html##d0e368505)**. Nonetheless, the date the international application was filed in the USPTO will not be lost as a filing date for the international application if at least one applicant is a resident or national of any PCT Contracting State. Under **[PCT Rule 19.4](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e368498.html##d0e368587)**, the USPTO will receive the application on behalf of the International Bureau as receiving Office (**[PCT Rule 19.4(a))](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e368498.html##d0e368587)**  and, upon payment of a fee equal to the transmittal fee, the USPTO will promptly transmit the international application to the International Bureau under **[PCT Rule 19.4(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e368498.html##d0e368587)**. However, if all of the applicants are indicated to be both residents and nationals of non-PCT Contracting States, **[PCT Rule 19.4](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e368498.html##d0e368587)**  does not apply, and the application is denied an international filing date.

The USPTO is also not competent to receive international applications that are not in the English language and, upon payment of a fee equal to the transmittal fee, the USPTO will forward such applications to the International Bureau under **[PCT Rule 19.4](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e368498.html##d0e368587)**  provided they are in a language accepted by the International Bureau as receiving Office.

A discussion of **[PCT Rule 19.4](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e368498.html##d0e368587)**  is also included in **[MPEP § 1805](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e164352.html)**.

##    **SIGNATURE OF APPLICANT OR AGENT**

Pursuant to **[PCT Rule 4.15](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e365863.html##d0e366296)**, the international application must be signed in Box No. X of the request by the applicant, or, where there are two or more applicants, by all of them. However, under **[PCT Rule 26.2bis,](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e369418.html##d0e369454)**  it is sufficient for purposes of **[PCT Article 14(1)(a)(i)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363352.html##d0e363365)**  that the application is signed by only one of the applicants. The United States Receiving Office will not issue an invitation to applicants to furnish missing signatures where the request is signed by at least one of the applicants. Notwithstanding **[PCT Rule 26.2bis,](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e369418.html##d0e369441)**  any designated/elected office, in accordance with its national law, can still require confirmation of the international application by the signature of any applicant for such designated state who has not signed the request. **[PCT Rule 51bis.1(a)(vi).](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e372964.html##d0e372975)**  Pursuant to **[37 CFR 1.4(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e313174.html)**, the request filed may be either an original, or a copy thereof.

The international application may be signed by an agent. Pursuant to **[37 CFR 1.34](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e317605.html)**, a patent practitioner acting in a representative capacity must set forth his or her registration number on submitted papers.

The requirement for the submission of a separate power of attorney may be waived by the receiving Office. The United States Receiving Office will, in most cases, waive the requirement for a separate power of attorney. See **[MPEP § 1807](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e164506.html)**.

The United States Receiving Office will accept signatures meeting the requirements of either **[37 CFR 1.4(d)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e313174.html##d0e313239)**  with respect to handwritten signatures or **[37 CFR 1.4(d)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e313174.html##d0e313257)**  with respect to S-signatures. For handwritten signatures, the name of each person signing the international application should be indicated (preferably typewritten) next to the signature. For S-signatures, the signer’s name must be presented in printed or typed form preferably immediately below or adjacent the S-signature, and must be reasonably specific enough so that the identity of the signer can be readily recognized. See **[MPEP § 502.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e26345.html)**, subsection II. Pursuant to **[37 CFR 1.4(d)(2)(ii)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e313174.html##d0e313285)**, a patent practitioner using an S-signature must supply his or her registration number either as part of the S-signature, or immediately below or adjacent to the S-signature.

Where a person signs on behalf of a legal entity (an organization such as a corporation, university, nonprofit organization, or governmental agency), his or her name and the capacity in which he or she signs should be indicated. Proof of the person’s authority to sign on behalf of the legal entity will be required if that person does not possess apparent authority to sign on behalf of the legal entity and that person has not submitted a statement that he or she is authorized to sign on behalf of the legal entity (discussed below). An officer (President, Vice-President, Secretary, Treasurer, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer or Chief Financial Officer) of an organization is presumed to have authority to sign on behalf of that organization. The signature of the chairman of the board is also acceptable, but not the signature of an individual director. Variations of these titles (such as vice-president for sales, executive vice-president, assistant treasurer, vice-chairman of the board of directors) are acceptable. In general, a person having a title (manager, director, administrator, general counsel) that does not clearly set forth that person as an officer of the organization is not presumed to be an officer or to have the authority to sign on behalf of the organization. However, an exception is made with respect to foreign juristic applicants. This is because in foreign countries, a person who holds the title "Manager" or "Director" is normally an officer or the equivalent thereof; therefore, those terms are generally acceptable as indicating proper persons to sign applications for foreign applicants. However, titles such as "Manager of Patents," suggesting narrowly limited duties, are not acceptable. An attorney does not generally have apparent authority to sign on behalf of an organization.

Proof that a person has the authority to sign on behalf of a legal entity may take the form of a copy of a resolution of the board of directors, a provision of the bylaws, or a copy of a paper properly delegating authority to that person to sign the international application on behalf of the legal entity.

It is acceptable to have a person sign the international application on behalf of a legal entity if that person submits a statement that the person has the authority to sign the international application on behalf of the legal entity. This statement should be on a separate paper and must not appear on the Request (or Demand) form itself. The statement must include a clause such as "The undersigned (whose title is supplied below) is empowered to sign the Request on behalf of the applicant."

The international application can be filed without applicant’s signature on the request. The lack of any required signature on the request is a correctable defect under **[PCT Article 14(1)(a)(i) and (b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363352.html)**, and can be remedied by filing a copy of the request (or, where the request has been signed by an agent, of a power of attorney) duly signed by the applicant within the time limit fixed by the receiving Office for the correction of this defect.

# 1821    The Request [R-01.2024]

A general overview of certain aspects of the request follows.

#### _37 C.F.R. 1.434  The request._

- (a) The request shall be made on a standardized form (**[PCT Rules 3](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e365795.html)**  and **[4](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e365863.html)** ). Copies of printed Request forms are available from the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Letters requesting printed forms should be marked "Mail Stop PCT."
- (b) The Check List portion of the Request form should indicate each document accompanying the international application on filing.
- (c) All information, for example, addresses, names of States and dates, shall be indicated in the Request as required by **[PCT Rule 4](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e365863.html)**  and Administrative Instructions **[110](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e279050.html)**  and **[201](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e279223.html)**.
- (d) For the purposes of the designation of the United States of America, an international application shall include:
    - (1) The name of the inventor; and;
    - (2) A reference to any prior-filed national application or international application designating the United States of America, if the benefit of the filing date for the prior-filed application is to be claimed.
- (e) An international application may also include in the Request a declaration of the inventors as provided for in PCT Rule **[4.17(iv)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e365863.html##d0e366328)**.

The Request must either be made on a standardized form PCT/RO/101 to be filled in with the required indications or be presented as a computer printout complying with the PCT Administrative Instructions. The Request form PCT/RO/101 may be downloaded for free from WIPO’s website (**[www.wipo.int/pct/en/forms/](https://www.wipo.int/pct/en/forms/)** ). Applicants may also obtain an English language Request form free of charge from the United States Patent and Trademark Office using the following address: Mail Stop PCT, Commissioner for Patents, P.O. Box 1450, Alexandria, Virginia 22313-1450.

As an alternative to using the standardized Request form PCT/RO/101, applicants may use WIPO’s ePCT system to generate a computer printout of the Request complying with the PCT Administrative Instructions. ePCT incorporates and expands the functionality of WIPO’s prior PCT-SAFE software. As of July 1, 2022, WIPO no longer develops, distributes, or supports PCT-SAFE. ePCT is a web-based application that does not require installation and subsequent periodic updates of any software on the user's computer. The ePCT system validates user-entered data and creates a zip file containing the Request and fee calculation sheet in PDF format. Submission of the ePCT zip file with an international application filed electronically (i.e., via the USPTO patent electronic filing system) entitles the applicant to a reduction of the international filing fee. For information on ePCT, see **[https://pct.wipo.int/ePCT](https://pct.wipo.int/ePCT)**.

For inventions made in the United States, applicants should be mindful of certain foreign filing restrictions and the potential need to obtain a foreign filing license when using WIPO’s ePCT system. See **[MPEP § 1832](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e170680.html)** and _Facilitating the Use of the World Intellectual Property Organization’s ePCT System To Prepare International Applications for Filing With the United States Receiving Office_, 85 Fed. Reg. 61604 (Sept. 30, 2020).

The Request contains a petition for the international application to be processed according to the PCT and must also contain certain indications. It must contain the title of the invention. It must identify the applicant and the agent (if any), and must contain the designation of at least one Contracting State.

The Request may not contain any matter that is not specified in **[PCT Rules 4.1](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e365863.html##d0e365870)**  to **[4.17](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e365863.html##d0e366328)**  or permitted under **[PCT Rule 4.18(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e365863.html##d0e366394)**  by the Administrative Instructions. Any additional material will be deleted _ex officio_. See **[PCT Rule 4.18(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e365863.html##d0e366394)**  and Administrative Instructions Section **[303](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e280026.html)**.

## I.    **DATES**

Each date appearing in the international application or in any correspondence must be indicated by the Arabic number of the day, the name of the month and the Arabic number of the year, in that order. In the request, after, below or above that indication, the date should be repeated in parentheses with a two-digit Arabic numeral each for the number of the day and for the number of the month and followed by the number of the year in four digits, in that order and separated by periods, slashes or hyphens after the digit pairs of the day and of the month, for example, "20 March 2020 (20.03.2020)," "20 March 2020 (20/03/2020)," or "20 March 2020 (20-03-2020)." See Administrative Instructions Section **[110](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e279050.html)**.

## II.    **SUPPLEMENTAL BOX**

This box is used for any material which cannot be placed in one of the previous boxes because of space limitations. The supplemental information placed in this box should be clearly entitled with the Box number from which it is continued, e.g., "Continuation of Box No. IV." For indicating the international application as a continuation or continuation-in-part of an earlier application, see **[MPEP § 1828.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//ch1800_d1ffca_27201_348.html)**.

## III.    **FILE REFERENCE**

The applicant or the applicant’s agent may indicate a file reference in the box provided for this purpose on the first sheet of the Request form, on each page of the other elements of the international application, on the first sheet of the demand form, and in any other correspondence relating to the international application. **[PCT Rule 11.6(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e366850.html##d0e366945)**  indicates that the file reference may be included in the top margin of the sheets of the international application. As provided in Administrative Instructions Section **[109](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e279033.html)**, the file reference may be composed either of letters of the Latin alphabet or Arabic numerals, or both. It may not exceed 25 characters including spaces. If the file reference exceeds 25 characters, the receiving Office may _ex officio_ truncate the reference number to 25 characters and notify the applicant. The receiving Office, the International Bureau, the International Searching Authority and the International Preliminary Examining Authority (International Authorities) will use the file reference in correspondence with the applicant.

## IV.    **TITLE OF INVENTION**

The Request must contain the title of the invention; the title must be short (preferably 2 to 7 words) and precise (**[PCT Rule 4.3](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e365863.html##d0e365979)** ). The title in Box No. I of the Request is considered to be the title of the application. The title appearing on the first page of the description (**[PCT Rule 5.1(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e366450.html##d0e366457)** ) and on the page containing the abstract should be consistent with the title indicated in Box No. I of the Request form.

A title should not be changed by the examiner merely because it contains words which are not considered descriptive of the invention. Words, for example, such as "improved" or "improvement of" are acceptable. If the title is otherwise not descriptive of the invention, a change to a more descriptive title should be made and the applicant informed thereof in the search report.

Where the title is missing or is inconsistent with the title in the description, the receiving Office invites the applicant to correct the missing or inconsistent title.

## V.    **APPLICANT**

See **[MPEP § 1806](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//ch1800_d1ffcb_1d71d_75.html)** regarding who can be an applicant.

## VI.    **NAMES**

The name of a natural person must be indicated by the family name followed by the given name(s). Academic degrees or titles or other indications which are not part of the person’s name must be omitted. The family name should preferably be written in capital letters.

The name of a legal entity must be indicated by its full official designation (preferably in capital letters).

## VII.    **ADDRESSES**

Addresses must be indicated in such a way as to satisfy the requirements for prompt postal delivery at the address indicated and must consist of all the relevant administrative units up to and including the house number (if any). The address must also include the country.

## VIII.    **DESIGNATION OF STATES**

#### _PCT Administrative Instructions Section 209_

#### _Indications as to Deposited Biological Material on a Separate Sheet_

- (a) To the extent that any indication with respect to deposited biological material is not contained in the description, it may be given on a separate sheet. Where any such indication is so given, it shall preferably be on Form PCT/RO/134 and, if furnished at the time of filing, the said Form shall, subject to paragraph (b), preferably be attached to the request and referred to in the check list referred to in **[Rule 3.3(a)(ii)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e365795.html##d0e365838)**.
- (b) For the purposes of designated Offices, which have so notified the International Bureau under **[Rule 13 bis.7(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e367565.html)**, paragraph (a) applies only if the said Form or sheet is included as one of the sheets of the description of the international application at the time of filing.

#### _37 C.F.R. 1.435  The description._

- (a) The application must meet the requirements as to the content and form of the description set forth in **[PCT Rules 5](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e366450.html)**, **[9](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e366731.html)**, **[10](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e366800.html)**, and **[11](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e366850.html)**  and sections **[204](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e279262.html)**  and **[208](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e279429.html)**  of the Administrative Instructions.
- (b) In international applications designating the United States the description must contain upon filing an indication of the best mode contemplated by the inventor for carrying out the claimed invention.

The description must disclose the invention in a manner sufficiently clear and complete for it to be carried out by a person skilled in the art. It must start with the title of the invention as appearing in Box No. I of the request. **[PCT Rule 5](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e366450.html)**  contains detailed requirements as to the manner and order of the description, which, generally, should be in six parts. Those parts should have the following headings: "Technical Field," "Background Art," "Disclosure of Invention," "Brief Description of Drawings," "Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention" or, where appropriate, "Mode(s) for Carrying Out the Invention," and "Industrial Applicability," where applicable.

For international applications having an international filing date before July 1, 2022, headings for "Sequence Listing" and "Sequence Listing Free Text" should also be used where applicable. See Section 204 of the Administrative Instructions (in effect before July 1, 2022), which may be found at: **[www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text/584509](https://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text/584509)**.

For international applications having an international filing date on or after July 1, 2022, the description may include a sequence listing. Where applicable, the sequence listing should be included as a separate part of the description complying with the standard provided for in the PCT Administrative Instructions.

For more information on filing nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence listings, see **[MPEP § 1823.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e169024.html)**. For information on reference to deposited biological material, see **[MPEP § 1823.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e168618.html)**.

The details required for the disclosure of the invention so that it can be carried out by a person skilled in the art depend on the practice of the national Offices. It is therefore recommended that due account be taken of national practice in the United States of America when the description is drafted. The need to amend the description during the national phase may thus be avoided.

This applies likewise to the need to indicate the "best mode for carrying out the invention." If at least one of the designated Offices requires the indication of the best mode (for instance, the United States Patent and Trademark Office), that best mode must be indicated in the description.

A description drafted with due regard to what is said in these provisions will be accepted by all the designated Offices. It might require more care than the drafting of a national patent application, but certainly much less effort than the drafting of multiple applications, which is necessary where the PCT route is not used for filing in several countries.

# 1823.01    Reference to Deposited Biological Material [R-07.2015]

#### _PCT Rule 13bis_

#### _Inventions Relating to Biological Material_

# 13_bis_.1 Definition

For the purposes of this Rule, "reference to deposited biological material" means particulars given in an international application with respect to the deposit of a biological material with a depositary institution or to the biological material so deposited.

# 13 _bis_.2  References (General)

Any reference to deposited biological material shall be made in accordance with this Rule and, if so made, shall be considered as satisfying the requirements of the national law of each designated State.

# 13 _bis_.3  References: Contents; Failure to Include Reference or Indication

- (a) A reference to deposited biological material shall indicate:
    - (i) the name and the address of the depositary institution with which the deposit was made;
    - (ii) the date of deposit of the biological material with that institution;
    - (iii) the accession number given to the deposit by that institution; and
    - (iv) any additional matter of which the International Bureau has been notified pursuant to **[Rule 13 bis .7(a)(i)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e367637.html##d0e367843)**, provided that the requirement to indicate that matter was published in the Gazette in accordance with **[Rule 13bis.7(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e367637.html##d0e367843)**  at least two months before the filing of the international application.
    - (b) Failure to include a reference to deposited biological material or failure to include, in a reference to deposited biological material, an indication in accordance with paragraph (a), shall have no consequence in any designated State whose national law does not require such reference or such indication in a national application.

# 13 _bis_.4  References: Time Limit for Furnishing Indications

- (a) Subject to paragraphs (b) and (c), if any of the indications referred to in **[Rule 13 bis.3(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e367637.html##d0e367672)**  is not included in a reference to deposited biological material in the international application as filed but is furnished to the International Bureau:
    - (i) within 16 months from the priority date, the indication shall be considered by any designated Office to have been furnished in time;
    - (ii) after the expiration of 16 months from the priority date, the indication shall be considered by any designated Office to have been furnished on the last day of that time limit if it reaches the International Bureau before the technical preparations for international publication have been completed.
- (b) If the national law applicable by a designated Office so requires in respect of national applications, that Office may require that any of the indications referred to in **[Rule 13bis.3(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e367637.html##d0e367672)**  be furnished earlier than 16 months from the priority date, provided that the International Bureau has been notified of such requirement pursuant to **[Rule 13bis.7(a)(ii)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e367637.html##d0e367843)**  and has published such requirement in the Gazette in accordance with **[Rule 13bis.7(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e367637.html##d0e367843)**  at least two months before the filing of the international application.
- (c) Where the applicant makes a request for early publication under **[Article 21(2)(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363622.html)**, any designated Office may consider any indication not furnished before the technical preparations for international publication have been completed as not having been furnished in time.
- (d) The International Bureau shall notify the applicant of the date on which it received any indication furnished under paragraph (a), and:
    - (i) if the indication was received before the technical preparations for international publication have been completed, publish the indication furnished under paragraph (a), and an indication of the date of receipt, together with the international application;
    - (ii) if the indication was received after the technical preparations for international publication have been completed, notify that date and the relevant data from the indication to the designated Offices.

# 13 _bis_.5  References and Indications for the Purposes of One or More Designated States; Different Deposits for Different Designated States; Deposits with Depositary Institutions Other than Those Notified

- (a) A reference to deposited biological material shall be considered to be made for the purposes of all designated States, unless it is expressly made for the purposes of certain of the designated States only; the same applies to the indications included in the reference.
- (b) References to different deposits of the biological material may be made for different designated States.
- (c) Any designated Office may disregard a deposit made with a depositary institution other than one notified by it under **[Rule 13bis.7(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e367637.html##d0e367878)**.

# 13 _bis_.6  Furnishing of Samples

Pursuant to **[Articles 23](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363691.html)**  and **[40](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364373.html)**, no furnishing of samples of the deposited biological material to which a reference is made in an international application shall, except with the authorization of the applicant, take place before the expiration of the applicable time limits after which national processing may start under the said Articles. However, where the applicant performs the acts referred to in **[Articles 22](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363665.html)**  or **[39](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364336.html)**  after international publication but before the expiration of the said time limits, the furnishing of samples of the deposited biological material may take place, once the said acts have been performed. Notwithstanding the previous provision, the furnishing of samples of the deposited biological material may take place under the national law applicable by any designated Office as soon as, under that law, the international publication has the effects of the compulsory national publication of an unexamined national application.

# 13 _bis_.7 National Requirements: Notification and Publication

- (a) Any national Office may notify the International Bureau of any requirement of the national law:
    - (i) that any matter specified in the notification, in addition to those referred to in **[Rule 13bis.3(a)(i)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e367637.html##d0e367687)**, **[(ii)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e367637.html##d0e367691)**  and **[(iii)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e367637.html##d0e367695)**, is required to be included in a reference to deposited biological material in a national application;
    - (ii) that one or more of the indications referred to in **[Rule 13bis.3(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e367637.html##d0e367683)**  are required to be included in a national application as filed or are required to be furnished at a time specified in the notification which is earlier than 16 months from the priority date.
- (b) Each national Office shall notify the International Bureau of the depositary institutions with which the national law permits deposits of biological materials to be made for the purposes of patent procedure before that Office or, if the national law does not provide for or permit such deposits, of that fact.
- (c) The International Bureau shall promptly publish in the Gazette requirements notified to it under paragraph (a) and information notified to it under paragraph (b).

#### _PCT Administrative Instructions Section 209_

#### _Indications as to Deposited Biological Material on a Separate Sheet_

- (a) To the extent that any indication with respect to deposited biological material is not contained in the description, it may be given on a separate sheet. Where any such indication is so given, it shall preferably be on Form PCT/RO/134 and, if furnished at the time of filing, the said Form shall, subject to paragraph (b), preferably be attached to the request and referred to in the check list referred to in **[Rule 3.3(a)(ii)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e365795.html##d0e365822)**.
- (b) For the purposes of designated Offices, which have so notified the International Bureau under **[Rule 13bis.7(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e367637.html##d0e367854)**, paragraph (a) applies only if the said Form or sheet is included as one of the sheets of the description of the international application at the time of filing.

##    **REFERENCES TO DEPOSITED BIOLOGICAL MATERIAL IN THE CASE OF MICROBIOLOGICAL INVENTIONS**

The PCT does not require the inclusion of a reference to a biological material and/or to its deposit with a depositary institution in an international application; it merely prescribes the contents of any "reference to deposited biological material" (defined as "particulars given... with respect to the deposit of biological material... or to the biological material so deposited") which is included in an international application, and when such a reference must be furnished. It follows that the applicant may see a need to make such a reference only when it is required for the purpose of disclosing the invention claimed in the international application in a manner sufficient for the invention to be carried out by a person skilled in the art that is, when the law of at least one of the designated States provides for the making, for this purpose, of a reference to a deposited biological material if the invention involves the use of a biological material that is not available to the public. Any reference to a deposited biological material furnished separately from the description will be included in the publication of the international application.

A reference to a deposited biological material made in accordance with the requirements of the PCT must be regarded by each of the designated Offices as satisfying the requirements of the national law applicable in that Office with regard to the contents of such references and the time for furnishing them.

A reference may be made for the purposes of all designated States or for one or only some of the designated States. A reference is considered to be made for the purpose of all designated States unless it is expressly made for certain designated States only. References to different deposits may be made for the purposes of different designated States.

There are two kinds of indication which may have to be given with regard to the deposit of the biological material, namely:

- (A) indications specified in the PCT Regulations themselves; and
- (B) additional indications by the national (or regional) Office of (or acting for) a State designated in the international application and which have been published in the _PCT Gazette_; these additional indications may relate not only to the deposit of the biological material but also to the biological material itself.

The indications in the first category are:

(1) the name and the address of the depositary institution with which the deposit was made;

(2) the date of the deposit with that institution; and

(3) the accession number given to the deposit by that institution.

U.S. requirements include the name and address of the depository institution at the time of filing, the date of the deposit or a statement that the deposit was made on or before the priority date of the international application and, to the extent possible, a taxonomic description of the biological material. See Annex L of the PCT Applicant’s Guide.

The national laws of some of the national (or regional) Offices require that, besides indications concerning the deposit of a biological material, an indication be given concerning the biological material itself, such as, for example, a short description of its characteristics, at least to the extent that this information is available to the applicant. These requirements must be met in the case of international applications for which any such Office is a designated Office, provided that the requirements have been published in the _PCT Gazette_. Annex L of the PCT Applicant’s Guide indicates, for each of the national (or regional) Offices, the requirements (if any) of this kind which have been published.

If any indication is not included in a reference to a deposited biological material contained in the international application as filed, it may be furnished to the International Bureau within 16 months after the priority date unless the International Bureau has been notified (and, at least 2 months prior to the filing of the international application, it has published in the _PCT Gazette_) that the national law requires the indication to be furnished earlier. However, if the applicant makes a request for early publication, all indications should be furnished by the time the request is made, since any designated Office may regard any indication not furnished when the request is made as not having been furnished in time.

No check is made in the international phase to determine whether a reference has been furnished within the prescribed time limit. However, the International Bureau notifies the designated Offices of the date(s) on which indications, not included in the international application as filed, were furnished to it. Those dates are also mentioned in the publication of the international application. Failure to include a reference to a deposited biological material (or any indication required in such a reference) in the international application as filed, or failure to furnish it (or the indication) within the prescribed time limit, has no consequence if the national law does not require the reference (or indication) to be furnished in a national application. Where there is a consequence, it is the same as that which applies under the national law.

To the extent that indications relating to the deposit of a biological material are not given in the description, because they are furnished later, they may be given in the "optional sheet" provided for that purpose. If the sheet is submitted when the international application is filed, a reference to it should be made in the check list contained on the last sheet of the Request form. Should certain States be designated, e.g., Israel, Japan, Korea, Mexico, or Turkey , such a sheet must, if used, be included as one of the sheets of the description at the time of filing; otherwise the indications given in it will not be taken into account by the respective patent offices of those designated States in the national phase. Requirements of the various Offices are set forth in Annex L of the PCT Applicant’s Guide, available online at **[www.wipo.int/pct/en/appguide](http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/appguide)**. If the sheet is furnished to the International Bureau later, it must be enclosed with a letter.

Each national (or regional) Office whose national law provides for deposits of biological material for the purposes of patent procedure notifies the International Bureau of the depositary institutions with which the national law permits such deposits to be made. Information on the institutions notified by each of those Offices is published by the International Bureau in the _PCT Gazette_.

A reference to a deposit cannot be disregarded by a designated Office for reasons pertaining to the institution with which the biological material was deposited if the deposit referred to is one made with a depositary institution notified by that Office. Thus, by consulting the _PCT Gazette_ or Annex L of the PCT Applicant’s Guide, the applicant can be sure that he has deposited the biological material with an institution which will be accepted by the designated Office.

International Searching Authorities and International Preliminary Examining Authorities are not expected to request access to deposited biological material. However, in order to retain the possibility of access to a deposited biological material referred to in an international application which is being searched or examined by such an Authority, the PCT provides that the Authorities may, if they fulfill certain conditions, ask for samples. Thus, an Authority may only ask for samples if it has notified the International Bureau (in a general notification) that it may require samples and the International Bureau has published the notification in the _PCT Gazette_. The only Authority which has made such a notification (and thus the only Authority which may request samples) is the Japan Patent Office. If a sample is asked for, the request is directed to the applicant, who then becomes responsible for making the necessary arrangements for the sample to be provided.

The furnishing of samples of a deposit of a biological material to third persons is governed by the national laws applicable in the designated Offices. **[PCT Rule 13bis.6(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e367565.html)**, however, provides for the delaying of any furnishing of samples under the national law applicable in each of the designated (or elected) Offices until the start of the national phase, subject to the ending of this "delaying effect" brought about by the occurrence of either of the following two events:

- (A) the applicant has, after international publication of the international application, taken the steps necessary to enter the national phase before the designated Office.
- (B) international publication of the international application has been effected, and that publication has the same effects, under the national law applicable in the designated Office, as the compulsory national publication of an unexamined national application (in other words, the international application has qualified for the grant of "provisional protection").

Any sequence listing, whether forming part of the international application or not forming part of the international application, shall comply with Annex C. Sequences and references to sequences included in the main part of the description, claims and drawings shall also comply with Annex C.

## I.    **REQUIREMENTS FOR SEQUENCE LISTINGS UNDER WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OFFICE STANDARD ST.26 (WIPO STANDARD ST.26)**

[Editor Note: This subsection is applicable to all international applications, including national phase applications, having an international filing date on or after July 1, 2022, that disclose one or more nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences as defined in WIPO Standard ST.26.]

Patent applications that disclose a nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence(s) by enumeration of its residues, as defined in WIPO Standard ST.26, must present each sequence and associated sequence data in a standardized electronic eXtensible Markup Language (XML) format as a separate part of the specification. This standardized format is set forth in WIPO Standard ST.26 and applies to sequence listings in international applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) and in national and regional applications filed in the intellectual property offices (IPOs) of WIPO member states. As a result, a single sequence listing in compliance with WIPO Standard ST.26 can be prepared for use in all IPOs of WIPO member states.

Where an international application, filed under the PCT, contains a disclosure of nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences that are required to be listed within a sequence listing, **[PCT Rule 5.2](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e366450.html##d0e366501)**  requires that the description shall include a sequence listing part of the description complying with the standard provided for in the Administrative Instructions. In accordance with Section 208 of the Administrative Instructions, any sequence listing, whether forming part of the international application or not forming part of the international application, shall comply with **[Annex C](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e285466.html##aai_it_35ef5_20add_3db)**  of the Administrative Instructions. Where applicant has not provided a sequence listing in accordance with **[Annex C](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e285466.html##aai_it_35ef5_20add_3db)**  of the Administrative Instructions and the USPTO acts as International Searching Authority (ISA) or International Preliminary Examining Authority (IPEA), the ISA/IPEA may invite applicant to furnish a sequence listing, with a late furnishing fee, under **[PCT Rule 13ter](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e367886.html)** . This invitation will specify a time limit for a proper response. A proper response to such an invitation would include, the submission of a sequence listing in accordance with **[Annex C](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e285466.html##aai_it_35ef5_20add_3db)**  of the Administrative Instructions, the late furnishing fee specified in **[37 CFR 1.445(a)(5)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e328174.html##ar_it_2bf24_2594d_31f)**, and a statement to the effect that the sequence listing does not go beyond the disclosure of the international application as filed. If a sequence listing compliant with WIPO Standard ST.26 has not been furnished to the ISA/IPEA within the time limit set forth in the invitation, the ISA/IPEA will only search/examine the international application to the extent that a meaningful search or examination can be performed without the sequence listing. See **[PCT Rule 13ter.1(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e367886.html##d0e367921)**. Where the application discloses sequences that are required to be within a sequence listing, it is advisable for the applicant to submit a sequence listing compliant with WIPO Standard ST.26 together with the international application on the international filing date rather than to wait for an invitation by the International Searching Authority or International Preliminary Examining Authority.

For a detailed discussion of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Standard ST.26, see **[MPEP §§ 2412](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//ch2400_d22348_25ede_3e6.html)** - **[2419](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//ch2400_d35dcb_1e61f_10b.html)**, in particular **[MPEP § 2414.05](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//ch2400_d35e1f_25c72_2b6.html)**.

## II.    **REQUIREMENTS FOR SEQUENCE LISTINGS UNDER WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OFFICE STANDARD ST.25 (WIPO ST.25)**

[Editor Note: This subsection is only applicable to international applications, including national phase applications, having an international filing date before July 1, 2022, that disclose one or more nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences as defined in WIPO Standard ST.25.]

Where an international application discloses one or more nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences, the description must contain a sequence listing complying with the standard specified in the Administrative Instructions. A copy of the Administrative Instructions in force before July 1, 2022 can be found at: **[www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text/584509](https://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text/584509)**. The standard is set forth in detail in **[Annex C](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e285466.html##aai_it_35ef5_20add_3db)**  - Standard for the Presentation of Nucleotide and Amino Acid Sequence Listings in International Patent Applications Under the PCT. The standard allows the applicant to draw up a single sequence listing which is acceptable to all receiving Offices, International Searching and Preliminary Examining Authorities for the purposes of the international phase, and to all designated and elected Offices for the purposes of the national phase.

Under **[PCT Rule 5.2(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e366450.html##d0e366509)**, the sequence listing must always be presented as a separate part of the description. When filing an international application (PCT) using the USPTO patent electronic filing system, the sequence listing part of the description may be submitted either as a single ASCII text file with a ".txt" extension (e.g., "seqlist.txt") or as a PDF file. Note that 100 megabytes is the size limit for submitting a sequence listing text file via the USPTO patent electronic filing system.

A single ASCII text file will serve both as the sequence listing part of the description under **[PCT Rule 5.2](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e366450.html##d0e366501)**  and the electronic form under **[PCT Rule 13ter.1(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e367886.html##d0e367906)**  in the absence of a PDF sequence listing file. The check list of the PCT Request (PCT/RO/101) provided via the USPTO patent electronic filing system together with the international application (PCT) must indicate that the sequence listing forms part of the international application. Furthermore, the statement as set forth in paragraph 4(v) of the AI **[Annex C](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e285466.html##aai_it_35ef5_20add_3db)**  (Administrative Instructions under the PCT, Annex C), that "the information recorded in electronic form furnished under **[PCT Rule 13ter](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e367886.html)**  is identical to the sequence listing as contained in the international application," is not required.

Submission of the sequence listing part of the description in a PDF file is not recommended because the applicant would also be required to supply a copy of the sequence listing in an ASCII text file to the appropriate authority for purposes of international search and/or international preliminary examination in accordance with paragraph 40 of AI **[Annex C](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e285466.html##aai_it_35ef5_20add_3db)**. When a sequence listing is filed via the USPTO patent electronic filing system in a new PCT international application in both a PDF file and an ASCII text file, but the Request form Box No. IX does not indicate which one forms part of the international application, the PDF copy of the sequence listing will be considered to form part of the application and the ASCII text file will be considered an accompanying item for search purposes under **[PCT Rule 13ter.1(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e367886.html##d0e367906)**  only.

In cases where a sequence listing does not meet the necessary requirements, such as it has been submitted in PDF format or .txt file does not comply with **[Annex C](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e285466.html##aai_it_35ef5_20add_3db)**, the International Searching Authority and the International Preliminary Examining Authority may invite the applicant to furnish, within a fixed time limit, a sequence listing complying with the required standard. The invitation may also, in accordance with **[PCT Rule 13ter.1(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e367886.html##d0e367917)**, request the payment of a late furnishing fee. Where such an invitation has been issued, the sequence listing and late fee must be submitted to the International Searching Authority or the International Preliminary Examining Authority. It is advisable for the applicant to submit a listing of the sequence in electronic form (text), if such a listing is required by the competent International Searching Authority or International Preliminary Examining Authority, together with the international application rather than to wait for an invitation by the International Searching Authority or International Preliminary Examining Authority.

The electronic form (text) is not mandatory in international applications to be searched by the United States International Searching Authority or examined by the United States International Preliminary Examining Authority. However, if an electronic form (text) of a sequence listing is not provided, a search or examination will be performed only to the extent possible in the absence of the electronic form (text). The U.S. sequence rules (**[37 CFR 1.821](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e333653.html)**  - **[1.825](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e334511.html)** ) and the PCT sequence requirements are substantively consistent. In this regard, full compliance with the requirements of the U.S. rules will generally ensure compliance with the applicable PCT requirements. However, the requirements of **[37 CFR 1.821](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e333653.html)**  through **[37 CFR 1.825](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e334511.html)**  are less stringent than the requirements of WIPO Standard ST.25. See **[MPEP § 2422, subsection II](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e242638.html)**, **[MPEP § 2422.03(a), subsection IV](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//ch2400_d24b1e_175aa_27c.html)**, and **[MPEP § 2422.07](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e245376.html)** for information specific to filing sequence listings in international applications.

For a detailed discussion of the U.S. sequence rules, see **[MPEP §§ 2420](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e242518.html)** - **[2429](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e247577.html)**.

The calculation of the international filing fee for an international application (PCT), including a sequence listing, filed via the USPTO patent electronic filing system is determined based on the type of sequence listing file. A sequence listing filed in an ASCII text file will not be included in the sheet count of the international application (PCT). A sequence listing filed in a PDF file will be included in the sheet count of the international application (PCT). Therefore, the sheet count for an international application (PCT) filed via the USPTO patent electronic filing system containing both a PDF file and a text file sequence listing will be calculated to include the number of sheets of the PDF sequence listing.

# 1824    The Claims [R-07.2015]

#### _PCT Article 6_

#### _The Claims_

The claim or claims shall define the matter for which protection is sought. Claims shall be clear and concise. They shall be fully supported by the description.

#### _PCT Rule 6_

#### _The Claims_

# 6.1 Number and Numbering of Claims

- (a) The number of the claims shall be reasonable in consideration of the nature of the invention claimed.
- (b) If there are several claims, they shall be numbered consecutively in Arabic numerals.
- (c) The method of numbering in the case of the amendment of claims shall be governed by the Administrative Instructions.

# 6.2 References to Other Parts of the International Application

- (a) Claims shall not, except where absolutely necessary, rely, in respect of the technical features of the invention, on references to the description or drawings. In particular, they shall not rely on such references as: "as described in part ... of the description," or "as illustrated in figure ... of the drawings."
- (b) Where the international application contains drawings, the technical features mentioned in the claims shall preferably be followed by the reference signs relating to such features. When used, the reference signs shall preferably be placed between parentheses. If inclusion of reference signs does not particularly facilitate quicker understanding of a claim, it should not be made. Reference signs may be removed by a designated Office for the purposes of publication by such Office.

# 6.3 Manner of Claiming

- (a) The definition of the matter for which protection is sought shall be in terms of the technical features of the invention.
- (b) Whenever appropriate, claims shall contain:
    - (i) a statement indicating those technical features of the invention which are necessary for the definition of the claimed subject matter but which, in combination, are part of the prior art,
    - (ii) a characterizing portion - preceded by the words "characterized in that," "characterized by," "wherein the improvement comprises," or any other words to the same effect - stating concisely the technical features which, in combination with the features stated under (i), it is desired to protect.
- (c) Where the national law of the designated State does not require the manner of claiming provided for in paragraph (b), failure to use that manner of claiming shall have no effect in that State provided the manner of claiming actually used satisfies the national law of that State.

# 6.4 Dependent Claims

- (a) Any claim which includes all the features of one or more other claims (claim in dependent form, hereinafter referred to as "dependent claim") shall do so by a reference, if possible at the beginning, to the other claim or claims and shall then state the additional features claimed. Any dependent claim which refers to more than one other claim ("multiple dependent claim") shall refer to such claims in the alternative only. Multiple dependent claims shall not serve as a basis for any other multiple dependent claim. Where the national law of the national Office acting as International Searching Authority does not allow multiple dependent claims to be drafted in a manner different from that provided for in the preceding two sentences, failure to use that manner of claiming may result in an indication under **[Article 17(2)(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363501.html)**  in the international search report. Failure to use the said manner of claiming shall have no effect in a designated State if the manner of claiming actually used satisfies the national law of that State.
- (b) Any dependent claim shall be construed as including all the limitations contained in the claim to which it refers or, if the dependent claim is a multiple dependent claim, all the limitations contained in the particular claim in relation to which it is considered.
- (c) All dependent claims referring back to a single previous claim, and all dependent claims referring back to several previous claims, shall be grouped together to the extent and in the most practical way possible.

# 6.5 Utility Models

Any designated State in which the grant of a utility model is sought on the basis of an international application may, instead of **[Rules 6.1](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e366517.html##d0e366524)**  to **[6.4](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e366517.html##d0e366588)**, apply in respect of the matters regulated in those Rules the provisions of its national law concerning utility models once the processing of the international application has started in that State, provided that the applicant shall be allowed at least two months from the expiration of the time limit applicable under **[Article 22](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363665.html)**  to adapt his application to the requirements of the said provisions of the national law.

#### _PCT Administrative Instructions Section 205_

#### _Numbering and Identification of Claims Upon Amendment_

- (a) Amendments to the claims under **[Article 19](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363565.html)**  or **[Article 34(2)(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364117.html)**  may be made either by cancelling one or more entire claims, by adding one or more new claims or by amending the text of one or more of the claims as filed. Where a claim is cancelled, no renumbering of the other claims shall be required. In all cases where claims are renumbered, they shall be renumbered consecutively in Arabic numerals.
- (b) The applicant shall, in the letter referred to in **[Rule 46.5(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e371568.html##at_d1fc9d_2c51a_38d)**  or **[Rule 66.8(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e374653.html##at_d1fc9d_2c723_9c)**, indicate the differences between the claims as filed and the claims as amended or, as the case may be, differences between the claims as previously amended and currently amended. He shall, in particular, indicate in the said letter, in connection with each claim appearing in the international application (it being understood that identical indications concerning several claims may be grouped), whether:
    - (i) the claim is unchanged;
    - (ii) the claim is cancelled;
    - (iii) the claim is new;
    - (iv) the claim replaces one or more claims as filed;
    - (v) the claim is the result of the division of a claim as filed;
    - (vi) the claim replaces one or more claims as previously amended;
    - (vii) the claim is the result of the division of a claim as previously amended.

#### _37 C.F.R. 1.436  The claims._

The requirements as to the content and format of claims are set forth in **[PCT Art. 6](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363146.html)**  and **[PCT Rules 6](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e366517.html)**, **[9](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e366731.html)**, **[10](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e366800.html)**  and **[11](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e366850.html)**  and shall be adhered to. The number of the claims shall be reasonable, considering the nature of the invention claimed.

The claim or claims must "define the matter for which protection is sought." Claims must be clear and concise. They must be fully supported by the description. **[PCT Rule 6](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e366517.html)**  contains detailed requirements as to the number and numbering of claims, the extent to which any claim may refer to other parts of the international application, the manner of claiming, and dependent claims. As to the manner of claiming, the claims must, whenever appropriate, be in two distinct parts; namely, the statement of the prior art and the statement of the features for which protection is sought ("the characterizing portion").

The physical requirements for the claims are the same as those for the description. Note that the claims must commence on a new sheet.

The procedure for rectification of obvious mistakes is explained in **[MPEP § 1836](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e171114.html)**. The omission of an entire sheet of the claims cannot be rectified without affecting the international filing date, except in applications filed on or after April 1, 2007, where, if the application, on its initial receipt date, contained a priority claim and a proper incorporation by reference statement, the original international filing date may be retained if the submitted correction was completely contained in the earlier application. See **[PCT Rules 4.18](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e365863.html##d0e366394)**  and **[20.6](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e368649.html##d0e368933)**. It is recommended that a request for rectification of obvious mistakes in the claims be made only if the mistake is liable to affect the international search; otherwise, the rectification should be made by amending the claims.

The claims can be amended during the international phase under **[PCT Article 19](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363565.html)**  on receipt of the international search report, during international preliminary examination if the applicant has filed a Demand, and during the national phase.

Multiple dependent claims are permitted in international applications before the United States Patent and Trademark Office as an International Searching and International Preliminary Examining Authority or as a Designated or Elected Office, if they are in the alternative only and do not serve as a basis for any other multiple dependent claim (**[PCT Rule 6.4(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e366517.html##d0e366588)**, **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e302824.html)** ). The claims, being an element of the application, should start on a new page (**[PCT Rule 11.4](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e366850.html##d0e366919)** ). Page numbers must not be placed in the margins (**[PCT Rule 11.7(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e366850.html##d0e367031)** ). Line numbers should appear in the right half of the left margin (**[PCT Rule 11.8(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e366850.html##d0e367047)** ). See **[PCT Rule 11.6(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e366850.html##d0e366945)**.

The number of claims shall be reasonable, considering the nature of the invention claimed (**[37 CFR 1.436](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e328101.html)** ).

# 1825    The Drawings [R-08.2017]

#### _PCT Article 7_

#### _The Drawings_

- (1) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (2)(ii), drawings shall be required when they are necessary for the understanding of the invention.
- (2) Where, without being necessary for the understanding of the invention, the nature of the invention admits of illustration by drawings:
    - (i) the applicant may include such drawings in the international application when filed.
    - (ii) any designated Office may require that the applicant file such drawings with it within the prescribed time limit.

#### _PCT Rule 7_

#### _The Drawings_

# 7.1 Flow Sheets and Diagrams

Flow sheets and diagrams are considered drawings.

# 7.2 Time Limit

The time limit referred to in **[Article 7(2)(ii)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363156.html)**  shall be reasonable under the circumstances of the case and shall, in no case, be shorter than two months from the date of the written invitation requiring the filing of drawings or additional drawings under the said provision.

#### _PCT Rule 11_

#### _Physical Requirements of the International Application_

*****

# 11.5 Size of Sheets

The size of the sheets shall be A4 (29.7 cm x 21 cm). However, any receiving Office may accept international applications on sheets of other sizes provided that the record copy, as transmitted to the International Bureau, and, if the competent International Searching Authority so desires, the search copy, shall be of A4 size.

# 11.6 Margins

*****

- (c) On sheets containing drawings, the surface usable shall not exceed 26.2 cm x 17.0 cm. The sheets shall not contain frames around the usable or used surface. The minimum margins shall be as follows:
- - top: 2.5 cm
- - left side: 2.5 cm
- - right side: 1.5 cm
- - bottom: 1.0 cm.

*****

# 11.11 Words in Drawings

(a) The drawings shall not contain text matter, except a single word or words, when absolutely indispensable, such as "water," "steam," "open," "closed," "section on AB," and, in the case of electric circuits and block schematic or flow sheet diagrams, a few short catchwords indispensable for understanding.

(b) Any words used shall be so placed that, if translated, they may be pasted over without interfering with any lines of the drawings.

*****

# 11.13 Special Requirements for Drawings

- (a) Drawings shall be executed in durable, black, sufficiently dense and dark, uniformly thick and well-defined, lines and strokes without colorings.
- (b) Cross-sections shall be indicated by oblique hatching which should not impede the clear reading of the reference signs and leading lines.
- (c) The scale of the drawings and the distinctness of their graphical execution shall be such that a photographic reproduction with a linear reduction in size to two-thirds would enable all details to be distinguished without difficulty.
- (d) When, in exceptional cases, the scale is given on a drawing, it shall be represented graphically.
- (e) All numbers, letters and reference lines, appearing on the drawings, shall be simple and clear. Brackets, circles or inverted commas shall not be used in association with numbers and letters.
- (f) All lines in the drawings shall, ordinarily, be drawn with the aid of drafting instruments.
- (g) Each element of each figure shall be in proper proportion to each of the other elements in the figure, except where the use of a different proportion is indispensable for the clarity of the figure.
- (h) The height of the numbers and letters shall not be less than 0.32 cm. For the lettering of drawings, the Latin and, where customary, the Greek alphabets shall be used.
- (i) The same sheet of drawings may contain several figures. Where figures on two or more sheets form in effect a single complete figure, the figures on the several sheets shall be so arranged that the complete figure can be assembled without concealing any part of any of the figures appearing on the various sheets.
- (j) The different figures shall be arranged on a sheet or sheets without wasting space, preferably in an upright position, clearly separated from one another. Where the figures are not arranged in an upright position, they shall be presented sideways with the top of the figures at the left side of the sheet.
- (k) The different figures shall be numbered in Arabic numerals consecutively and independently of the numbering of the sheets.
- (l) Reference signs not mentioned in the description shall not appear in the drawings, and vice versa.
- (m) The same features, when denoted by reference signs, shall, throughout the international application, be denoted by the same signs.
- (n) If the drawings contain a large number of reference signs, it is strongly recommended to attach a separate sheet listing all reference signs and the features denoted by them.

#### _37 C.F.R. 1.437  The drawings._

- (a) Drawings are required when they are necessary for the understanding of the invention (**[PCT Art. 7](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363156.html)** ).
- (b) The physical requirements for drawings are set forth in **[PCT Rule 11](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e366850.html)**  and shall be adhered to.

The international application must contain drawings when they are necessary for the understanding of the invention. Moreover where, without drawings being actually necessary for the understanding of the invention, its nature admits of illustration by drawings, the applicant may include such drawings and any designated Office may require the applicant to file such drawings during the national phase. Flow sheets and diagrams are considered drawings.

Drawings must be presented on one or more separate sheets. They may not be included in the description, the claims or the abstract. They may not contain text matter, except a single word or words when absolutely indispensable. Note that if the drawings contain text matter not in English but in a language accepted under **[PCT Rule 12.1(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e367227.html##d0e367234)**  by the International Bureau as a Receiving Office, the international application will be transmitted to the International Bureau for processing in its capacity as a Receiving Office. See **[37 CFR 1.412(c)(6)(ii)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e327307.html)**. If the drawings contain text matter not in a language accepted under **[PCT Rule 12.1(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e367227.html##d0e367234)**  by the International Bureau as a Receiving Office, the application will be denied an international filing date.

All lines in the drawings must, ordinarily, be drawn with the aid of a drafting instrument and must be executed in black, uniformly thick and well-defined lines. Color drawings are not acceptable. **[PCT Rules 11.10](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e366850.html##d0e367094)**  to **[11.13](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e366850.html##d0e366909)**  contain detailed requirements as to further physical requirements of drawings. Drawings newly executed according to national standards may not be required during the national phase if the drawings filed with the international application comply with **[PCT Rule 11](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e366850.html)**. The examiner may require new drawings where the drawings which were accepted during the international phase did not comply with **[PCT Rule 11](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e366850.html)**. A file reference may be indicated in the upper left corner on each sheet of the drawings.

All of the figures constituting the drawings must be grouped together on a sheet or sheets without waste of space, preferably in an upright position and clearly separated from each other. Where the drawings cannot be presented satisfactorily in an upright position, they may be placed sideways, with the tops of the drawings on the left-hand side of the sheet.

The usable surface of sheets (which must be of A4 size) must not exceed 26.2 cm x 17.0 cm. The sheets must not contain frames around the usable surface. The minimum margins which must be observed are: top and left side: 2.5 cm; right side: 1.5 cm; bottom: 1.0 cm.

All sheets of drawings must be numbered in the center of either the top or the bottom of each sheet but not in the margin in numbers larger than those used as reference signs in order to avoid confusion with the latter. For drawings, a separate series of page numbers is to be used. The number of each sheet of the drawings must consist of two Arabic numerals separated by an oblique stroke, the first being the sheet number and the second being the total number of sheets of drawings. For example, "2/5" would be used for the second sheet of drawings where there are five in all.

Different figures on the sheets of drawings must be numbered in Arabic numerals consecutively and independently of the numbering of the sheets and, if possible, in the order in which they appear. This numbering should be preceded by the expression "Fig."

In situations where one or more sheets are added, each sheet shall be identified by the number of the preceding sheet followed by a slant and then by another Arabic numeral such that the additional sheets are numbered consecutively, starting always with number one for the first sheet added after an unchanged sheet (e.g., 10/1, 15/1, 15/2, 15/3, etc.). See Administrative Instructions Section **[311](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e280767.html)**.

The PCT makes no provision for photographs. Nevertheless, they are allowed by the International Bureau where it is impossible to present in a drawing what is to be shown (for instance, crystalline structures). Where, exceptionally, photographs are submitted, they must be on sheets of A4 size, they must be black and white, and they must respect the minimum margins and admit of direct reproduction. Color photographs are not accepted.

The procedure for rectification of obvious mistakes in the drawings is explained in **[MPEP § 1836](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e171114.html)**. The omission of an entire sheet of drawings cannot be rectified without affecting the international filing date, except in applications filed on or after April 1, 2007, where, if the application, on its initial receipt date, contained a priority claim and a proper incorporation by reference statement, the original international filing date may be retained if the submitted correction was completely contained in the earlier application. See **[PCT Rules 4.18](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e365863.html##d0e366394)**  and **[20.6](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e368649.html##d0e368933)**. Rectifications of obvious mistakes are not considered to be amendments.

The drawings can be amended during the international phase only if the applicant files a Demand for international preliminary examination. The drawings can also be amended during the national phase. The amendment shall not go beyond the disclosure in the international application as filed. See **[PCT Article 34(2)(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364117.html##d0e364134)**.

If drawings are referred to in an international application and are not found in the search copy file, the examiner should refer the application to a Quality Assurance Specialist in his or her Technology Center or a PCT Special Program Examiner. See Administrative Instructions Section **[310](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e280496.html)**.

# 1826    The Abstract [R-08.2017]

#### _PCT Rule 8_

#### _The Abstract_

# 8.1 Contents and Form of the Abstract

- (a) The abstract shall consist of the following:
    - (i) a summary of the disclosure as contained in the description, the claims, and any drawings; the summary shall indicate the technical field to which the invention pertains and shall be drafted in a way which allows the clear understanding of the technical problem, the gist of the solution of that problem through the invention, and the principal use or uses of the invention;
    - (ii) where applicable, the chemical formula which, among all the formulae contained in the international application, best characterizes the invention.
- (b) The abstract shall be as concise as the disclosure permits (preferably 50 to 150 words if it is in English or when translated into English).
- (c) The abstract shall not contain statements on the alleged merits or value of the claimed invention or on its speculative application.
- (d) Each main technical feature mentioned in the abstract and illustrated by a drawing in the international application shall be followed by a reference sign, placed between parentheses.

# 8.2 Figure

- (a) If the applicant fails to make the indication referred to in **[Rule 3.3(a)(iii)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e365795.html##d0e365822)**, or if the International Searching Authority finds that a figure or figures other than that figure or those figures suggested by the applicant would, among all the figures of all the drawings, better characterize the invention, it shall, subject to paragraph (b), indicate the figure or figures which should accompany the abstract when the latter is published by the International Bureau. In such case, the abstract shall be accompanied by the figure or figures so indicated by the International Searching Authority. Otherwise, the abstract shall, subject to paragraph (b), be accompanied by the figure or figures suggested by the applicant.
- (b) If the International Searching Authority finds that none of the figures of the drawings is useful for the understanding of the abstract, it shall notify the International Bureau accordingly. In such case, the abstract, when published by the International Bureau, shall not be accompanied by any figure of the drawings even where the applicant has made a suggestion under **[Rule 3.3(a)(iii)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e365795.html##d0e365822)**.

# 8.3 Guiding Principles in Drafting

The abstract shall be so drafted that it can efficiently serve as a scanning tool for purposes of searching in the particular art, especially by assisting the scientist, engineer or researcher in formulating an opinion on whether there is a need for consulting the international application itself.

#### _37 C.F.R. 1.438  The abstract_

- (a) Requirements as to the content and form of the abstract are set forth in **[PCT Rule 8](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e366660.html)**, and shall be adhered to.
- (b) Lack of an abstract upon filing of an international application will not affect the granting of a filing date. However, failure to furnish an abstract within one month from the date of the notification by the Receiving Office will result in the international application being declared withdrawn.

The abstract must consist of a summary of the disclosure as contained in the description, the claims and any drawings. Where applicable, it must also contain the most characteristic chemical formula. The abstract must be as concise as the disclosure permits (preferably 50 to 150 words if it is in English or when translated into English). National practice (see **[MPEP § 608.01(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e44136.html)**) also provides a maximum of 150 words for the abstract. See **[37 CFR 1.72(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e320224.html)**. The PCT range of 50 - 150 words is not absolute but publication problems could result when the PCT limit is increased beyond the 150 word limit. Maintaining the PCT upper limit is encouraged. As a rule of thumb, it can be said that the volume of the text of the abstract, including one of the figures from the drawings (if any), should not exceed what can be accommodated on an A4 sheet of typewritten matter, 1 1/2 spaced. The abstract of the international application as filed must begin on a new sheet following the claims (Administrative Instructions Section **[207](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e279393.html)** ). The other physical requirements must correspond to those for the description. The abstract must be so drafted that it can efficiently serve as a scanning tool for the purposes of searching in the particular art. These and other requirements concerning the abstract are spelled out in detail in **[PCT Rule 8](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e366660.html)**. Useful guidance can be obtained from the "Guidelines for the Preparation of Abstracts Under the Patent Cooperation Treaty," published in the _PCT Gazette_ (No. 5/1978). Those Guidelines may be obtained, in English and French, from the International Bureau.

The abstract should be primarily related to what is new in the art to which the invention pertains. Phrases should not be used which are implicit, (for instance, "the invention relates to..."), and statements on the alleged merits or value of the invention are not allowed.

Where the receiving Office finds that the abstract is missing, it invites the applicant to furnish it within a time limit fixed in the invitation. Where the receiving Office has not invited the applicant to furnish an abstract or the applicant fails to furnish an abstract within a time limit fixed in the invitation, the International Searching Authority establishes one. See **[PCT Rule 38](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e370660.html)**. The same applies where the abstract does not comply with the requirements outlined in the preceding paragraphs. Where the abstract is established by the International Searching Authority, the applicant may propose modifications of, or comment on, the new abstract until the expiration of 1 month from the date of mailing of the international search report (**[PCT Rule 38.3](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e370660.html##d0e370693)** ).

##    **SUMMARY OF ABSTRACT REQUIREMENTS**

Preferably 50-150 words. Should contain:

- (A) Indication of field of invention.
- (B) Clear indication of the technical problem.
- (C) Summary of invention’s solution of the problem.
- (D) Principal use or uses of the invention.
- (E) Reference numbers of the main technical features placed between parentheses.
- (F) Where applicable, chemical formula which best characterizes the invention.

Should not contain:

- (A) Superfluous language.
- (B) Legal phraseology such as "said" and "means."

# 1827    Fees [R-01.2024]

A complete list of Patent Cooperation Treaty fee amounts which are to be paid to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), for both the national and international stages, can be found at the beginning of each weekly issue of the _Official Gazette_ of the United States Patent and Trademark Office and on the International Patent Legal Administration page of the USPTO website (see **[MPEP § 1730](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e163385.html)**). Applicants are urged to refer to this list before submitting any fees to the USPTO.

Pursuant to **[PCT Rules 14.1(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e367979.html##d0e367986)**, **[PCT Rule 15.3](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e368006.html##d0e368057)**, and **[16.1(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e368100.html##d0e368107)**, the international filing, transmittal, and search fee payable is the international filing, transmittal, and search fee in effect on the receipt date of the international application. See **[37 CFR 1.431(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e327806.html)**. For international applications filed on or after November 15, 2011, the transmittal fee paid to the USPTO as Receiving Office consists of both a basic portion and a non-electronic filing portion. See **[37 CFR 1.445(a)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e328174.html##d0e328189)**. The non-electronic filing portion is applicable where applicant files the international application in paper rather than via the USPTO patent electronic filing system.

# 1827.01    Refund of International Application Fees [R-07.2022]

#### _37 C.F.R. 1.446  Refund of international application filing and processing fees._

- (a) Money paid for international application fees, where paid by actual mistake or in excess, such as a payment not required by law or treaty and its regulations, may be refunded. A mere change of purpose after the payment of a fee will not entitle a party to a refund of such fee. The Office will not refund amounts of twenty-five dollars or less unless a refund is specifically requested and will not notify the payor of such amounts. If the payor or party requesting a refund does not provide the banking information necessary for making refunds by electronic funds transfer, the Office may use the banking information provided on the payment instrument to make any refund by electronic funds transfer.
- (b) Any request for refund under paragraph (a) of this section must be filed within two years from the date the fee was paid. If the Office charges a deposit account by an amount other than an amount specifically indicated in an authorization under § **[1.25(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e328929.html)**, any request for refund based upon such charge must be filed within two years from the date of the deposit account statement indicating such charge and include a copy of that deposit account statement. The time periods set forth in this paragraph are not extendable.
- (c) Refund of the supplemental search fees will be made if such refund is determined to be warranted by the Director or the Director’s designee acting under **[PCT Rule 40.2(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e370760.html##d0e370797)**.
- (d) The international and search fees will be refunded if no international filing date is accorded or if the application is withdrawn before transmittal of the record copy to the International Bureau (PCT Rules 15.6 and **[16.2](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e368100.html##d0e368148)** ). The search fee will be refunded if the application is withdrawn before transmittal of the search copy to the International Searching Authority. The transmittal fee will not be refunded.
- (e) The handling fee (§ **[1.482(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e328929.html)** ) will be refunded (**[PCT Rule 57.6](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e373881.html)** ) only if:
    - (1) The Demand is withdrawn before the Demand has been sent by the International Preliminary Examining Authority to the International Bureau, or
    - (2) The Demand is considered not to have been submitted (**[PCT Rule 54.4(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e373512.html##d0e373581)** ).

Although **[37 CFR 1.446(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e328239.html)**  indicates that a "mere change of purpose after the payment of a fee will not entitle a party to a refund of such fee," **[37 CFR 1.446(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e328239.html)**  and (e) contain exceptions to this general statement.

According to **[37 CFR 1.446(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e328239.html)**, the international and search fees will be refunded if no international filing date is accorded or if the application is withdrawn before transmittal of the record copy to the International Bureau. The search fee will be refunded if the application is withdrawn before the search copy is transmitted to the International Searching Authority. The transmittal fee will not be refunded.

According to **[37 CFR 1.446(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e328239.html)**, the handling fee will be refunded if the Demand is withdrawn before the Demand has been sent by the International Preliminary Examining Authority to the International Bureau.

Refund of the supplemental search fee will be made if the applicant is successful in a protest (filed pursuant to **[37 CFR 1.477](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e328778.html)** ) to a holding of lack of unity of invention. The supplemental search fee must be paid and be accompanied by (1) a protest and (2) a request for refund of the supplemental search fee.

If the receiving Office and International Searching Authority are not the same Office, any request for refund of the search fee made after the search copy has been transmitted to the International Searching Authority must be directed to the International Searching Authority and not to the receiving Office.

# 1828    Priority Claim and Document [R-07.2015]

An applicant who claims the priority of one or more earlier national, regional or international applications for the same invention must indicate on the Request, at the time of filing, the country in or for which it was filed, the date of filing, and the application number. See **[PCT Article 8](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363180.html)**  and **[PCT Rule 4.10](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e365863.html##d0e366150)**  for priority claim particulars and **[PCT Rule 90bis.3](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377369.html##d0e377450)**  for withdrawal of priority claims. Note that under **[PCT Rule 4.10](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e365863.html##d0e366150)**, an applicant may claim the priority of an application filed in or for a State which is a Member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), even if that State is not party to the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property (Paris Convention). However, a PCT Contracting State that is not a Member of the WTO would not be obliged to recognize the effects of such a priority claim.

The applicant may correct or add a priority claim by a notice submitted to the Receiving Office or the International Bureau (IB) within 16 months from the priority date, or where the priority date is changed, within 16 months from the priority date so changed, whichever period expires first, provided that a notice correcting or adding a priority claim may in any event be submitted until the expiration of 4 months from the international filing date. **[PCT Rule 26bis.1](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e369418.html)**  and **[37 CFR 1.451](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e328303.html)**  and **[1.465](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e328520.html)**. For a withdrawal of a priority claim, see **[MPEP § 1859](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e182287.html)**.

Under the PCT procedure, the applicant may file the certified copy of the earlier filed national application together with the international application in the receiving Office for transmittal with the record copy, or alternatively the certified copy may be submitted by the applicant to the IB or the receiving Office not later than 16 months from the priority date or, if the applicant has requested early processing in any designated Office, not later than the time such processing or examination is requested. The IB will normally furnish copies of the certified copy to the various designated Offices so that the applicant will not normally be required to submit certified copies to each designated Office. If the earlier filed application was filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the applicant may request the U.S. Receiving Office (RO/US) to prepare, and transmit to the IB, a certified copy of the earlier application. The request (Form PCT/RO/101) contains a box which can be checked requesting that the receiving Office prepare the certified copy. In international applications filed in the RO/US on or after August 31, 2007, the RO/US will electronically transmit the certified copy of the earlier application if the applicant has made a request in accordance with **[PCT Rule 17.1(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e368311.html##d0e368336)**  and **[37 CFR 1.451(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e328303.html##d0e328324)**. Further, in such international applications filed on or after August 31, 2007, the USPTO has waived the fee set out in **[37 CFR 1.19(b)(1)(iii)(A)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e316102.html)**  for electronically providing a copy of the patent application as filed. If the earlier application is made available to the International Bureau via a digital library, applicant may request the International Bureau to obtain a copy of the earlier application from the digital library. The International Bureau will electronically obtain the copy of the earlier application if the applicant has made a request in accordance with **[PCT Rule 17.1(b-bis](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e368311.html##at_d24d84_23240_230)** ).

Transmission may be delayed or prevented when no inventor common to the priority application is named in the international application. Further, transmission of the priority document will not occur until its national security review is complete.

For use of the priority document in a U.S. national application which entered the national stage from an international application after compliance with **[35 U.S.C. 371](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e307164.html)**, see **[MPEP § 1893.03(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e191121.html)**.

# 1828.01    Restoration of the Right of Priority [R-07.2022]

#### _37 C.F.R. 1.452  Restoration of right of priority_

- (a) If the international application has an international filing date which is later than the expiration of the priority period as defined by **[PCT Rule 2.4](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e365713.html##d0e365768)**  but within two months from the expiration of the priority period, the right of priority in the international application may be restored upon request if the delay in filing the international application within the priority period was unintentional.
- (b) A request to restore the right of priority in an international application under paragraph (a) of this section must be filed not later than two months from the expiration of the priority period and must include:
    
    - (1) A notice under **[PCT Rule 26bis.1(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e369679.html##d0e369699)**  adding the priority claim, if the priority claim in respect of the earlier application is not contained in the international application;
    
    - (2) The petition fee as set forth in § **[1.17(m)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//eff_20130320_d0e315199.html##eff_20130320_d0e315732)**; and
    - (3) A statement that the delay in filing the international application within the priority period was unintentional. The Director may require additional information where there is a question whether the delay was unintentional.
- (c) If the applicant makes a request for early publication under **[PCT Article 21(2)(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363622.html##d0e363642)**, any requirement under paragraph (b) of this section filed after the technical preparations for international publication have been completed by the International Bureau shall be considered as not having been submitted in time.

On April 1, 2007, the regulations to the PCT were amended to allow applicants with applications which were filed on or after that date and which were also filed after the expiration of the 12 month priority period but within two months of the expiration of the priority period, to request that the right of priority be restored, provided that the failure to file the application within the priority period was in spite of due care or unintentional. See **[PCT Rule 26 bis.3](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e369418.html##d0e369485)**. Grantable requests for restoration of the right of priority must be filed within two months from the date of expiration of the priority period as defined by new **[PCT Rule 2.4](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e365713.html##d0e365768)**, and must be accompanied by: (i) the requisite fee as set forth in § **[1.17(m)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//eff_20130320_d0e315199.html##eff_20130320_d0e315732)**; (ii) a notice under **[PCT Rule 26 bis.1(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e369418.html##d0e369425)**  adding the priority claim, if the priority claim in respect of the earlier application is not contained in the international application; and (iii) a statement that the delay in filing the international application within the priority period was unintentional. The Director may require additional information where there is a question whether the delay was unintentional. If the applicant makes a request for early publication under **[PCT Article 21(2)(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363622.html)**, any of requirements (i), (ii), or (iii) above which are filed after the technical preparations for international publication have been completed by the International Bureau shall be considered as not having been submitted in time.

The International Bureau decides these matters under both the in spite of due care and unintentional standards. Therefore, in view of the fact that the USPTO only decides these matters under the unintentional standard, applicants may wish to consider filing directly with the International Bureau as receiving Office instead of the United States Receiving Office in the situation where applicant desires to request restoration of the right of priority under the in spite of due care standard. Applicants may also request that an application be forwarded to the International Bureau for processing in its capacity as a receiving Office in accordance with **[PCT Rule 19.4(a)(iii)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e368498.html##d0e368587)**  in situations where applicants, after the international application has been filed, realize that the application was filed after the expiration of the 12 month priority period but within two months of the expiration of the priority period, and where applicant desires to request restoration of the right of priority under the in spite of due care standard. However, the United States Receiving Office may decline to forward the international application to the International Bureau under **[PCT Rule 19.4(a)(iii)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e368498.html##d0e368616)**  if substantial processing of the international application by the United States Receiving Office has occurred. An international application filed with, or forwarded to, the International Bureau must have a foreign filing license unless: (1) the invention was not made in the United States; or (2) a U.S. national application on the invention was filed at least six months prior to the filing of the international application, the U.S. national application is not subject to a secrecy order under **[37 CFR 5.2](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e337176.html)**, and the international application does not contain modifications, amendments, or supplements changing the general nature of the invention in a manner that would require any corresponding United States application to be or have been available for inspection under **[35 U.S.C. 181](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e304551.html)**. See **[37 CFR 5.11](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e337342.html)**  and **[5.15](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e337491.html)**.

It should be noted that restoration of a right of priority to a prior application by the United States Receiving Office, or by any other receiving Office, under the provisions of **[PCT Rule 26 bis.3](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e369418.html##d0e369485)**, will not entitle applicants to a right of priority to such prior application in a national stage application in any office that has notified the International Bureau under **[PCT Rule 26bis.3(j)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e369679.html##d0e369914)**  and **[49ter.1(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e372689.html##d0e372789)**  of an incompatibility with its national law. A full listing of the national offices that will not accept the restoration of the right of priority in the national stage may be found on WIPO’s website at **[www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts/reservations/res_incomp.html](http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/appguide)**. In the United States, a right of priority that has been restored under **[PCT Rule 26bis.3](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e369679.html##d0e369822)**  during the international stage will be effective in the U.S. national stage. See **[MPEP § 1893.03(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e191506.html)**.

It should also be noted that regardless of the **[PCT Rule 26bis.3(j)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e369679.html##d0e369914)**  and **[49ter.1(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e372689.html##d0e372789)**  status of any particular office, the priority date will still govern all PCT time limits, including the thirty-month period for filing national stage papers and fees under **[37 CFR 1.495](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//aia_d0e329467.html)**. **[PCT Article 2(xi)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e362923.html##d0e362974)**, which defines "priority date" for purposes of computing time limits, contains no limitation that the priority claim be valid.

In addition, in the context of a request for restoration of the right of priority pursuant to **[PCT Rule 26bis.3(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e369679.html##d0e369833)**, the receiving Office shall, upon reasoned request by the applicant or _sua sponte_, not transmit documents or parts thereof in relation to the request for restoration, if it finds that (i) the document or part thereof does not obviously serve the purpose of informing the public about the international application; (ii) publication or public access or any such document or part thereof would clearly prejudice the personal or economic interests of any person; and (iii) there is no prevailing public interest to grant access to that document or part thereof. See **[PCT Rule 26bis.3(h-bis)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e369679.html##at_it_27303_27948_21c)**.

# 1828.02    Continuation or Continuation-in-Part Indication in the Request [R-07.2022]

#### _PCT Rule 4_

#### _The Request (Contents)_

*****

# 4.11 Reference to Continuation or Continuation-in-Part, or Parent Application or Grant

- (a) If:
    - (ii) the applicant intends to make an indication under **[Rule 49bis.1(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e372597.html##d0e372644)**  of the wish that the international application be treated, in any designated State, as an application for a continuation or a continuation-in-part of an earlier application; the request shall so indicate and shall indicate the relevant parent application or parent patent or other parent grant.

*****

The Supplemental Box of the Request form should be used where the applicant has an earlier pending United States nonprovisional application or international application designating the U.S. and wishes the later-filed international application to be treated as a continuation or continuation-in-part of such earlier application. To properly identify the parent application, the specific reference must identify the parent application by application number and indicate the relationship to the parent application (i.e., "continuation" or "continuation-in-part"). The specific reference must also indicate the filing date of the parent application if the parent application is an international application. See **[37 CFR 1.78(d)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//aia_d0e320662.html##ar_d1fc99_2073f_112)**.

The applicant may correct or add to the request any indication referred to in **[PCT Rule 4.11](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e365863.html##d0e366208)**  by a notice submitted to the International Bureau within a time limit of 16 months from the priority date, provided that any notice received by the International Bureau after the expiration of that time limit shall be considered to have been received on the last day of that time limit if the notice reaches the International Bureau before the technical preparations for international publication have been completed. See **[PCT Rule 26quater.1](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//.html##at_d3112b_18aa2_3d4)**. Where any correction or addition of an indication referred to in **[PCT Rule 4.11](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e365863.html##d0e366208)**  is not timely received under **[PCT Rule 26quater.1](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//.html##at_d3112b_18aa2_3d4)**, the International Bureau shall notify the applicant accordingly and shall proceed as provided for in the Administrative Instructions. See **[PCT Rule 26quater.2](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//.html##at_d3112b_18b0e_301)**.

The inclusion of a proper reference to the parent application in the PCT Request form or the presence of such reference on the front page of the published international application will satisfy the requirement in **[37 CFR 1.78](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//aia_d0e320662.html)**  for the presentation of a benefit claim in an application data sheet. See **[37 CFR 1.76(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//plt_d0e320348.html##ar_d24abc_25165_ce)**. In such cases, a reference to the parent application in an application data sheet would not be required in the national stage application. Furthermore, inclusion of a proper reference to the parent application in the PCT Request form is also beneficial where applicant chooses to file a continuing application claiming benefit under **[35 U.S.C. 365(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e307034.html##d0e307053)**  to the international application (i.e., a bypass application) rather than entering the U.S. national phase under **[35 U.S.C. 371](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e307164.html)**. See **[MPEP § 211.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//ch200_d1ff71_22f37_244.html)**, which indicates the right to rely on a prior application may be waived by an applicant if a reference to the prior application is not included in the later-filed application.

# 1830    International Application Transmittal Letter [R-07.2015]

A PCT international application transmittal letter, Form PTO-1382, is available for applicants to use when filing PCT international applications and related documents with the United States Receiving Office. The form, which is intended to simplify the filing of PCT international applications and related documents with the United States Receiving Office, may be obtained online at **[www.uspto.gov/ patents-getting-started/international-protection/ patent-cooperation-treaty/pct-chapter-i-forms](http://www.uspto.gov/patents-getting-started/international-protection/patent-cooperation-treaty/pct-chapter-i-forms)**.

# 1831    [Reserved]

# 1832    License Request for Foreign Filing Under the PCT [R-07.2022]

A license for foreign filing is not required to file an international application in the United States Receiving Office but may be required before the applicant or the U.S. Receiving Office can forward a copy of the international application to a foreign patent office, the International Bureau or other foreign authority (**[35 U.S.C. 368](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e307110.html)**, **[37 CFR 5.1](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e337078.html)**  and **[5.11](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e337342.html)** ). A foreign filing license to permit transmittal to a foreign office or international authority is not required if: (1) the invention was not made in the United States; or (2) a U.S. national application on the invention was filed at least six months prior to the filing of the international application, the U.S. national application is not subject to a secrecy order under **[37 CFR 5.2](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e337176.html)**, and the international application does not contain modifications, amendments, or supplements changing the general nature of the invention in a manner that would require any corresponding United States application to be or have been available for inspection under **[35 U.S.C. 181](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e304551.html)**. See**[37 CFR 5.11](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e337342.html)**  and **[5.15](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e337491.html)**. In all other instances (direct foreign filings outside the PCT or filings in a foreign receiving Office), the applicant should petition for a license for foreign filing (**[37 CFR 5.12](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e337427.html)** ) and if appropriate, identify any additional subject matter in the international application which was not in the earlier U.S. national application (**[37 CFR 5.14(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e337465.html)** ).

If no petition or request for a foreign filing license is included in the international application, and it is clear that a license is required because of the designation of foreign countries and the time at which the Record Copy must be transmitted, it is current Office practice to construe the filing of such an international application to include a request for a foreign filing license. If the license can be granted, it will be issued without further correspondence. If no license can be issued, or further information is required, applicant will be contacted. The automatic request for a foreign filing license does not apply to the filing of a foreign application outside the PCT.

A foreign filing license also authorizes the export of technical data abroad for purposes related to the preparation, filing or possible filing, and prosecution of a foreign application. See **[37 CFR 5.11(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e337342.html##d0e337365)**. Effective September 30, 2020, **[37 CFR 5.11](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e337342.html)**  was amended to expand the scope of a foreign filing license to include the export of technical data abroad for purposes relating to the use of a World Intellectual Property Organization online service (ePCT) for preparing an international application for filing with the United States Receiving Office without separately complying with the regulations contained in 22 CFR parts 120 through 130 (International Traffic in Arms Regulations of the Department of State), 15 CFR parts 730 through 774 (Export Administration Regulations of the Bureau of Industry and Security, Department of Commerce), and 10 CFR part 810 (Assistance to Foreign Atomic Energy Activities Regulations of the Department of Energy). Applicants using WIPO’s ePCT system to prepare an international application for filing with the United States Receiving Office without a foreign filing license are cautioned against exporting technical data into ePCT without separately complying with the aforementioned regulations. See **[MPEP §§ 140](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e3682.html)** and **[1821](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e168204.html)**.

##    **EFFECT OF SECRECY ORDER**

If a secrecy order is applied to an international application, the application will not be forwarded to the International Bureau as long as the secrecy order remains in effect (**[PCT Article 27(8)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363805.html)**  and **[35 U.S.C. 368](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e307110.html)** ). If the secrecy order remains in effect, the international application will be declared withdrawn (abandoned) because the Record Copy of the international application was not received in time by the International Bureau (**[37 CFR 5.3(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e337205.html)**, **[PCT Article 12(3)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363301.html)**, and **[PCT Rule 22.3](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e369206.html##d0e369290)** ). It is, however, possible to prevent abandonment as to the United States of America if it has been designated, by fulfilling the requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 371(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e307164.html)**.

#### _PCT Administrative Instructions Section 105_

#### _Identification of International Application With Two or More Applicants_

Where any international application indicates two or more applicants, it shall be sufficient, for the purpose of identifying that application, to indicate, in any Form or correspondence relating to such application, the name of the applicant first named in the request. The provisions of the first sentence of this Section do not apply to the demand.

## I.    **NOTIFICATION UNDER PCT RULE 92.1(b) OF DEFECTS WITH REGARD TO CORRESPONDENCE**

If the Office finds that papers, other than the international application itself, are not accompanied by a letter identifying the international application to which they relate, or are accompanied by an unsigned letter, or are furnished in the form of an unsigned letter, it notifies the applicant and invites him or her to remedy the omission. The Office disregards the said papers or letter if the omission is not remedied within the time limit fixed in the invitation (**[PCT Rule 92.1(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377890.html##d0e377897)** ). If the omission has been overlooked and the paper taken into account, the omission is disregarded.

## II.    **CORRESPONDENCE ADDRESS**

Where there is a sole applicant without an agent in an international application, correspondence will be sent to the applicant at his or her indicated address; or, if he or she has appointed one or more agents, to that agent or the first-mentioned of those agents; or, if he or she has not appointed an agent but has indicated a special address for notifications, at that special address.

Where there are two or more applicants who have appointed one or more common agents, correspondence will be addressed to that agent or the first-mentioned of those agents. Where no common agent has been appointed, correspondence will be addressed to the common representative (either the appointed common representative or the applicant who is considered to be the common representative (**[PCT Rule 90.2](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377138.html##d0e377177)** ) at the indicated address; or, if the common representative has appointed one or more agents, to that agent or the first-mentioned of those agents; or, if the common representative has not appointed an agent but has indicated a special address for notifications, at that address.

## III.    **FILING OF CORRESPONDENCE BY MAIL**

The Priority Mail Express® procedure set forth at **[37 CFR 1.10](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e313951.html)**  applies to papers filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) in international applications. Accordingly, papers filed with the USPTO in international applications will be accorded by the USPTO the "date accepted" indicated on the Priority Mail Express® mailing label as the date of filing in the USPTO if the provisions of **[37 CFR 1.10](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e313951.html)**  are complied with. See **[MPEP § 513](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e33501.html)**.

If there is a question regarding the date of deposit, the Priority Mail Express® provisions of **[37 CFR 1.10(c) - (e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e313951.html)**  require, in addition to using the Priority Mail Express® Post Office to Addressee service, an indication of the Priority Mail Express® mailing label number on each paper or fee. In situations wherein the correspondence includes several papers directed to the same application (for example, Request, description, claims, abstract, drawings, and other papers) the correspondence may be submitted with a cover or transmittal letter, which should itemize the papers. The cover or transmittal letter must have the Priority Mail Express® mailing label number thereon.

The certificate of mailing by first class mail procedure set forth at **[37 CFR 1.8](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e313726.html)**  differs from the **[37 CFR 1.10](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e313951.html)**  Priority Mail Express® procedure. See **[37 CFR 1.8(a)(2)(i)(D)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e313726.html)**  and **[(E)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e313726.html)**. It is important to understand that the **[37 CFR 1.8](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e313726.html)**  certificate of mailing procedure CANNOT be used for filing any papers during the international stage if the date of deposit is desired. If the **[37 CFR 1.8](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e313726.html)**  certificate of mailing procedure is used, the paper and/or fee will be accorded the date of receipt in the USPTO unless the receipt date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or federal holiday in which case the date of receipt will be the next succeeding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or federal holiday (**[37 CFR 1.6(a)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e313447.html)** ). Accordingly, the certificate of mailing procedures of **[37 CFR 1.8](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e313726.html)**  are not available to have a submission during the international stage considered as timely filed if the submission is not physically received at the USPTO on or before the due date.

# 1834.01    Filing of Correspondence by Facsimile [R-07.2015]

**[PCT Rule 92.4](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377890.html##d0e377968)**  provides that a national Office may receive documents by telegraph, teleprinter, or facsimile machine. However, the United States Patent and Trademark Office has not informed the International Bureau that it accepts such submissions other than facsimile transmissions. Accordingly, applicants may not currently file papers in international applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office via telegraph or teleprinter.

Generally, any paper may be filed by facsimile transmission with certain exceptions which are identified in **[37 CFR 1.6(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e313447.html)**. It should be noted that a facsimile transmission of a document is not permitted and, if submitted, will not be accorded a date of receipt if the document is:

- (A) Required by statute to be certified;
- (B) A color drawing submitted under **[37 CFR 1.437](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e328126.html)**;
- (C) An international application for patent; or
- (D) A copy of the international application and the basic national fee necessary to enter the national stage, as specified in **[37 CFR 1.495(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e329467.html)**.

Facsimile transmission may be used to submit substitute sheets (other than color drawings), extensions of time, power of attorney, fee authorizations (other than the basic national fee), demands, response to written opinions, oaths or declarations, petitions, Article 34 amendments, and translations in international applications.

A Certificate of Transmission may be used as provided in **[37 CFR 1.8(a)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e313726.html)**  except in the instances specifically excluded in **[37 CFR 1.8(a)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e313726.html)**. Note particularly that the Certificate of Transmission cannot be used for the filing of an international application for patent or correspondence in an international application before the U.S. Receiving Office, the U.S. International Searching Authority, or the U.S. International Preliminary Examining Authority. Guidelines for facsimile transmission are clearly set forth in **[37 CFR 1.6(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e313447.html)**  and should be read before transmitting by facsimile machine.

A signature on a document received via facsimile in a permitted situation is acceptable as a proper signature. See **[PCT Rule 92.4(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377890.html##d0e377968)**  and **[37 CFR 1.4(d)(1)(ii)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e313174.html)**.

The receipt date of a document transmitted via facsimile is the date in the USPTO on which the transmission is completed, unless the receipt date is a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday in which case the date of receipt will be the next succeeding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday (**[37 CFR 1.6(a)(3)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e313447.html)** ). See **[37 CFR 1.6(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e313447.html)**. Where a document is illegible or part of the document is not received, the document will be treated as not received to the extent that it is illegible or the transmission failed. See **[PCT Rule 92.4(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377890.html##d0e377968)**.

# 1834.02    Irregularities in the Mail or Electronic Communications Service [R-07.2022]

#### _PCT Rule 82_

#### _Irregularities in the Mail Service_

# 82.1 Delay or Loss in Mail

- (a) Any interested party may offer evidence that he has mailed the document or letter five days prior to the expiration of the time limit. Except in cases where surface mail normally arrives at its destination within two days of mailing, or where no airmail service is available, such evidence may be offered only if the mailing was by airmail. In any case, evidence may be offered only if the mailing was by mail registered by the postal authorities.
- (b) If the mailing, in accordance with paragraph (a), of a document or letter is proven to the satisfaction of the national Office or intergovernmental organization which is the addressee, delay in arrival shall be excused, or, if the document or letter is lost in the mail, substitution for it of a new copy shall be permitted, provided that the interested party proves to the satisfaction of the said Office or organization that the document or letter offered in substitution is identical with the document or letter lost.
- (c) In the cases provided for in paragraph (b), evidence of mailing within the prescribed time limit, and, where the document or letter was lost, the substitute document or letter as well as the evidence concerning its identity with the document or letter lost shall be submitted within one month after the date on which the interested party noticed or with due diligence should have noticed the delay or the loss, and in no case later than six months after the expiration of the time limit applicable in the given case.
- (d) Any national Office or intergovernmental organization which has notified the International Bureau that it will do so shall, where a delivery service other than the postal authorities is used to mail a document or letter, apply the provisions of paragraphs (a) to (c) as if the delivery service was a postal authority. In such a case, the last sentence of paragraph (a) shall not apply but evidence may be offered only if details of the mailing were recorded by the delivery service at the time of mailing. The notification may contain an indication that it applies only to mailings using specified delivery services or delivery services which satisfy specified criteria. The International Bureau shall publish the information so notified in the Gazette.
- (e) Any national Office or intergovernmental organization may proceed under paragraph (d):
    - (i) even if, where applicable, the delivery service used was not one of those specified, or did not satisfy the criteria specified, in the relevant notification under paragraph (d), or
    - (ii) even if that Office or organization has not sent to the International Bureau a notification under paragraph (d).

## I.    **DELAY OR LOSS IN MAIL**

Delay or loss in the mail shall be excused when it is proven to the satisfaction of the receiving Office that the concerned letter or document was mailed at least five days before the expiration of the time limit. The mailing must have been by registered air mail or, where surface mail would normally arrive at the destination concerned within two days of mailing, by registered surface mail (**[PCT Rule 82.1(a) to (c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e376366.html##d0e376373)** ). **[PCT Rule 82](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e376366.html)**  contains detailed provisions governing the situation where a letter arrives late or gets lost due to irregularities in the mail service, for example, because the mail service was interrupted due to a strike. The provisions operate to excuse failure to meet a time limit for filing a document for up to six months after the expiration of the time limit concerned, provided that the document was mailed at least five days before the expiration of the time limit. In order to take advantage of these provisions, the mailing must have been by registered airmail or, where surface mail would normally arrive at the destination concerned within two days of mailing, by registered surface mail. Evidence is required to satisfy the Office, and a substitute document must be filed promptly—see **[PCT Rule 82.1(b) and (c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e376366.html##d0e376373)**  for details.

## II.    **INTERRUPTION IN MAIL OR ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS SERVICE**

Special provisions apply to excuse delays in meeting time limits fixed in the PCT Regulations, and to extend time limits due to a general disruption experienced by an office or authority, caused by war, revolution, civil disorder, strike, natural calamity, epidemic, a general unavailability of electronic communications services or other like reasons. For example, a delay in meeting a time limit may be excused where the interested party establishes that an outage of electronic communications services affected a widespread geographical area, was unexpected or unforeseen, and that no alternative means of communication was available. See **[PCT Rule 82quater](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//Rule_82quater.html)**  and PCT Administrative Instruction Section **[111](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e279061.html)**  for details.

- (g)  A mistake shall not be rectifiable under this Rule if:
    - (i) the mistake lies in the omission of one or more entire elements of the international application referred to in **[Article 3(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363046.html)**  or one or more entire sheets of the international application;
    - (ii) the mistake is in the abstract;
    - (iii) the mistake is in an amendment under **[Article 19](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363565.html)**, unless the International Preliminary Examining Authority is competent to authorize the rectification of such mistake under paragraph (b)(iii); or
    - (iv) the mistake is in a priority claim or in a notice correcting or adding a priority claim under **[Rule 26 bis.1(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e369679.html##d0e369699)**, where the rectification of the mistake would cause a change in the priority date;
        
        provided that this paragraph shall not affect the operation of Rules  **[20.4](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e368649.html##d0e368804)**, **[20.5](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e368649.html##d0e368849)**, **[26bis](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e369418.html)**  and **[38.3](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e370660.html##d0e370693)**.
        
- (h) Where the receiving Office, the International Searching Authority, the International Preliminary Examining Authority or the International Bureau discovers what appears to be a rectifiable obvious mistake in the international application or another document, it may invite the applicant to request rectification under this Rule.

# 91.2 Requests for Rectification

A request for rectification under **[Rule 91.1](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377673.html##d0e377680)**  shall be submitted to the competent authority within 26 months from the priority date. It shall specify the mistake to be rectified and the proposed rectification, and may, at the option of the applicant, contain a brief explanation. **[Rule 26.4](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e369418.html##d0e369653)**  shall apply _mutatis mutandis_ as to the manner in which the proposed rectification shall be indicated.

# 91.3 Authorization and Effect of Rectifications

- (a) The competent authority shall promptly decide whether to authorize or refuse to authorize a rectification under **[Rule 91.1](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377673.html##d0e377680)**  and shall promptly notify the applicant and the International Bureau of the authorization or refusal and, in the case of refusal, of the reasons therefor. The International Bureau shall proceed as provided for in the Administrative Instructions, including, as required, notifying the receiving Office, the International Searching Authority, the International Preliminary Examining Authority and the designated and elected Offices of the authorization or refusal.
- (b) Where the rectification of an obvious mistake has been authorized under **[Rule 91.1](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377673.html##d0e377680)**, the document concerned shall be rectified in accordance with the Administrative Instructions.
- (c) Where the rectification of an obvious mistake has been authorized, it shall be effective:
    - (i) in the case of a mistake in the international application as filed, from the international filing date;
    - (ii) in the case of a mistake in a document other than the international application as filed, including a mistake in a correction or an amendment of the international application, from the date on which that document was submitted.
- (d) Where the competent authority refuses to authorize a rectification under **[Rule 91.1](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377673.html##d0e377680)**, the International Bureau shall, upon request submitted to it by the applicant within two months from the date of the refusal, and subject to the payment of a special fee whose amount shall be fixed in the Administrative Instructions, publish the request for rectification, the reasons for refusal by the authority and any further brief comments that may be submitted by the applicant, if possible together with the international application. A copy of the request, reasons and comments (if any) shall if possible be included in the communication under **[Article 20](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363585.html)**  where the international application is not published by virtue of **[Article 64(3)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e365412.html)**.
- (e) The rectification of an obvious mistake need not be taken into account by any designated Office in which the processing or examination of the international application has already started prior to the date on which that Office is notified under **[Rule 91.3(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377673.html##d0e377822)**  of the authorization of the rectification by the competent authority.
- (f) A designated Office may disregard a rectification that was authorized under **[Rule 91.1](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377673.html##d0e377680)**  only if it finds that it would not have authorized the rectification under **[Rule 91.1](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377673.html##d0e377680)**  if it had been the competent authority, provided that no designated Office shall disregard any rectification that was authorized under **[Rule 91.1](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377673.html##d0e377680)**  without giving the applicant the opportunity to make observations, within a time limit which shall be reasonable under the circumstances, on the Office’s intention to disregard the rectification.

Obvious mistakes in the international application or other papers submitted by the applicant may generally be rectified under **[PCT Rule 91](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377673.html)**, if the rectification is authorized, as required, within the applicable time limit. Any such rectification is free of charge. The omission of entire sheets of the international application cannot be rectified under **[PCT Rule 91](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377673.html)**. Correction of such mistakes may only be made in accordance with **[PCT Rule 20.6](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e368649.html##d0e368933)**. Mistakes in the abstract, in amendments under PCT Article 19 (unless the International Preliminary Examining Authority is competent to authorize the rectification under **[PCT Rule 91.1(b)(iii)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377673.html##d0e377680)** ), or in a priority claim or in a notice correcting or adding a priority claim where the rectification would cause a change in the priority, also cannot be rectified under **[PCT Rule 91](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377673.html)**.

Applicants often attempt to rely upon the priority application to establish a basis for obvious mistake. The priority document (application) cannot be used to support obvious mistake corrections to the description, claims, or drawings or in a correction or amendment thereof. The rectification is obvious only in the sense that the competent authority (i.e., the receiving Office, the International Searching Authority, the International Preliminary Examining Authority, or the International Bureau), as appropriate, would immediately realize that something else was intended other than what appears in the document and that nothing else could have been intended than what is offered as rectification. Examples of obvious mistakes that are rectifiable include linguistic errors, spelling errors and grammatical errors so long as the meaning of the disclosure does not change upon entry of the rectification. Changes to chemical or mathematical formulas would not generally be rectifiable unless they would be common knowledge to anyone. A missing chemical formula or missing line of text would not be considered to be an obvious mistake subject to rectification.

Rectifications must be authorized:

- (A) by the Receiving Office if the mistake is in the request;

![Reformed PCT System](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/graphics/E9_R-01.2024/1842_1.png "Reformed PCT System")

## I.    **MEASURING TIME LIMITS UNDER THE PCT**

Time limits under the PCT are measured from the "priority date" of the application. The priority date for the purposes of computing time limits is defined in **[PCT Article 2(xi)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e362923.html)**. Where an international application does not contain any priority claim under **[PCT Article 8](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363180.html)**, the international filing date is considered to be the priority date.

## II.    **INTERNATIONAL FILING DATE**

An international application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty is generally filed within 12 months after the filing of the first application directed to the same subject matter, so that priority may be claimed under **[PCT Article 8](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363180.html)**  and **[Article 4](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363086.html)**  of the Stockholm Act of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property. **[PCT Article 11](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363237.html)**  specifies the elements required for an international application to be accorded an international filing date.

## III.    **ESTABLISHMENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL SEARCH REPORT AND WRITTEN OPINION OF THE INTERNATIONAL SEARCHING AUTHORITY**

As provided in **[PCT Rule 42](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e370881.html)**  and **[PCT Rule 43bis](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e371120.html)**, the time limit for establishing the international search report (or a declaration that no international search report will be established) and written opinion is three months from the receipt of the search copy by the International Searching Authority, or nine months from the priority date, whichever time limit expires later.

## IV.    **INTERNATIONAL PUBLICATION**

Under **[PCT Article 21](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363622.html)**, the international publication of the international application by the International Bureau shall be effected promptly after the expiration of 18 months from the priority date of that application.

## V.    **SUPPLEMENTARY INTERNATIONAL SEARCH (SIS)**

As provided in **[PCT Rule 45bis](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//Rule45bis.html)**, at any time prior to the expiration of 22 months from the priority date, the applicant can request one or more supplementary international searches each to be carried out by an International Searching Authority other than the International Searching Authority which carries out the main international search.

## VI.    **DEADLINE FOR FILING THE DEMAND**

International preliminary examination is optional. A demand for international preliminary examination must be filed prior to the expiration of whichever of the following periods expires later: (A) three months from the date of transmittal to the applicant of the international search report and the written opinion; or (B) 22 months from the priority date. Otherwise the demand shall be considered as if it had not been submitted and the International Preliminary Examining Authority shall so declare. See **[PCT Rule 54](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e373512.html)**. In order to take advantage of a national phase entry time limit of at least 30 months from the priority date in relation to all States designated in the international application, it may be necessary to file a demand before the expiration of 19 months from the priority date. See subsection VII.A., below.

## VII.    **DEADLINE FOR FILING COPY, TRANSLATION, AND FEE IN NATIONAL STAGE OFFICES**

A listing of all national and regional offices, and the corresponding time limits for entering the national stage following PCT Chapter I and PCT Chapter II, may be found on WIPO’s website at: **[www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts/time_limits.html](http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts/time_limits.html)**.

## A.    **_National Stage Entry Following PCT Chapter I_**

**[PCT Article 22(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363665.html##d0e363673)**  was amended, effective April 1, 2002, to specify that the national stage requirements are due not later than at the expiration of 30 months from the priority date if no demand has been filed. Prior to April 1, 2002, **[PCT Article 22(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363665.html##d0e363673)**  specified that these requirements were due not later than at the expiration of 20 months from the priority date. See **[www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts/time_limits.html](http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts/time_limits.html)**  for a list of the Contracting States that have not yet changed their national laws to adopt the 30 month period now set forth in **[PCT Article 22(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363665.html##d0e363673)**. (At the time of publication of this Chapter, only two countries have not adopted **[Article 22(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363665.html##d0e363673)**  as amended: Luxembourg (LU) and the United Republic of Tanzania (TZ). It is noted that Luxembourg is included in the regional designation "EPO" and that the United Republic of Tanzania is included in the regional designation "ARIPO.")

## B.    **_National Stage Entry Following PCT Chapter II_**

If the election of a Contracting State has been effected by filing a demand prior to the expiration of the 19th month from the priority date, the provisions of **[Article 39](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364336.html)**  apply rather than the provisions of **[Article 22](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363665.html)**. The deadline for filing the national stage requirements under PCT Article 39(a) is 30 months from the priority date, but any national law may fix time limits which expire later than the time limit provided in PCT Article 39(a). See PCT Article 39(b) and the list of time limits found on WIPO’s website at **[www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts/ time_limits.html](http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts/time_limits.html)**.

# 1843    The International Search [R-07.2015]

#### _PCT Article 17_

#### _Procedure Before the International Searching Authority_

- (1) Procedure before the International Searching Authority shall be governed by the provisions of this Treaty, the Regulations, and the agreement which the International Bureau shall conclude, subject to this Treaty and the Regulations, with the said Authority.
- (2)
    - (a) If the International Searching Authority considers:
        - (i) that the international application relates to a subject matter which the International Searching Authority is not required, under the Regulations, to search, and in the particular case decides not to search, or
        - (ii) that the description, the claims, or the drawings, fail to comply with the prescribed requirements to such an extent that a meaningful search could not be carried out, the said Authority shall so declare and shall notify the applicant and the International Bureau that no international search report will be established.
    - (b) If any of the situations referred to in subparagraph (a) is found to exist in connection with certain claims only, the international search report shall so indicate in respect of such claims, whereas, for the other claims, the said report shall be established as provided in Article 18.
- (3)
    - (a) If the International Searching Authority considers that the international application does not comply with the requirement of unity of invention as set forth in the Regulations, it shall invite the applicant to pay additional fees. The International Searching Authority shall establish the international search report on those parts of the international application which relate to the invention first mentioned in the claims ( "main invention" ) and, provided the required additional fees have been paid within the prescribed time limit, on those parts of the international application which relate to inventions in respect of which the said fees were paid.
    - (b) The national law of any designated State may provide that, where the national Office of the State finds the invitation, referred to in subparagraph (a), of the International Searching Authority justified and where the applicant has not paid all additional fees, those parts of the international application which consequently have not been searched shall, as far as effects in the State are concerned, be considered withdrawn unless a special fee is paid by the applicant to the national Office of that State.

The international search is a thorough, high quality search of the most relevant resources. Upon completion of the international search an international search report is established. The report provides information on the relevant prior art to the applicant, the public, the designated Offices, and the International Preliminary Examining Authority.

**[PCT Article 15](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363418.html)**  describes the objective of the international search, i.e., to uncover relevant prior art, and also describes the international-type search. It should be noted generally that an international-type search is performed on all U.S. national applications filed after June 1, 1978.

The written opinion indicates whether the claimed invention appears to be novel, to involve an inventive step (to be non-obvious), and to be industrially applicable. The written opinion also indicates any defects in the form or content of the international application under the PCT Articles or Regulations. In addition, the written opinion includes any observations that the International Searching Authority wishes to make on the clarity of the claims, the description, and the drawings, or on the question of whether the claims are fully supported by the description.

#### _PCT Rule 33_

#### _Relevant Prior Art for the International Search_

# 33.1 Relevant Prior Art for the International Search

- (a) For the purposes of **[Article 15(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363418.html)**, relevant prior art shall consist of everything which has been made available to the public anywhere in the world by means of written disclosure (including drawings and other illustrations) and which is capable of being of assistance in determining that the claimed invention is or is not new and that it does or does not involve an inventive step (i.e., that it is or is not obvious), provided that the making available to the public occurred prior to the international filing date.
- (b) When any written disclosure refers to an oral disclosure, use, exhibition, or other means whereby the contents of the written disclosure were made available to the public, and such making available to the public occurred on a date prior to the international filing date, the international search report shall separately mention that fact and the date on which it occurred if the making available to the public of the written disclosure occurred on a date which is the same as, or later than, the international filing date.
- (c) Any published application or any patent whose publication date is the same as, or later than, but whose filing date, or, where applicable, claimed priority date, is earlier than the international filing date of the international application searched, and which would constitute relevant prior art for the purposes of **[Article 15(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363418.html)**  had it been published prior to the international filing date, shall be specially mentioned in the international search report.

# 33.2 Fields to Be Covered by the International Search

- (a) The international search shall cover all those technical fields, and shall be carried out on the basis of all those search files, which may contain material pertinent to the invention.
- (b) Consequently, not only shall the art in which the invention is classifiable be searched but also analogous arts regardless of where classified.
- (c) The question what arts are, in any given case, to be regarded as analogous shall be considered in the light of what appears to be the necessary essential function or use of the invention and not only the specific functions expressly indicated in the international application.
- (d) The international search shall embrace all subject matter that is generally recognized as equivalent to the subject matter of the claimed invention for all or certain of its features, even though, in its specifics, the invention as described in the international application is different.

# 33.3 Orientation of the International Search

- (a) International search shall be made on the basis of the claims, with due regard to the description and the drawings (if any) and with particular emphasis on the inventive concept towards which the claims are directed.
- (b) In so far as possible and reasonable, the international search shall cover the entire subject matter to which the claims are directed or to which they might reasonably be expected to be directed after they have been amended.

#### _PCT Rule 64_

#### _Prior Art for International Preliminary Examination_

# 64.1 Prior Art

- (a) For the purposes of **[Article 33(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364085.html)**  and **[(3)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364085.html##d0e364101)**, everything made available to the public anywhere in the world by means of written disclosure (including drawings and other illustrations) shall be considered prior art provided that such making available occurred prior to the relevant date.
- (b) For the purposes of paragraph (a), the relevant date shall be:
    - (i) subject to items (ii) and (iii), the international filing date of the international application under international preliminary examination;
    - (ii) where the international application under international preliminary examination claims the priority of an earlier application and has an international filing date which is within the priority period, the filing date of such earlier application, unless the International Preliminary Examining Authority considers that the priority claim is not valid;
    - (iii) where the international application under international preliminary examination claims the priority of an earlier application and has an international filing date which is later than the date on which the priority period expired but within the period of two months from that date, the filing date of such earlier application, unless the International Preliminary Examining Authority considers that the priority claim is not valid for reasons other than the fact that the international application has an international filing date which is later than the date on which the priority period expired.

# 64.2 Non-Written Disclosures

In cases where the making available to the public occurred by means of an oral disclosure, use, exhibition or other non-written means ("non-written disclosure") before the relevant date as defined in **[Rule 64.1(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e374538.html##d0e374545)**  and the date of such non-written disclosure is indicated in a written disclosure which has been made available to the public on a date which is the same as, or later than, the relevant date, the non-written disclosure shall not be considered part of the prior art for the purposes of **[Article 33(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364085.html)**  and **[(3)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364085.html##d0e364101)**. Nevertheless, the international preliminary examination report shall call attention to such non-written disclosure in the manner provided for in **[Rule 70.9](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e375320.html##d0e375509)**.

# 64.3 Certain Published Documents

In cases where any application or any patent which would constitute prior art for the purposes of **[Article 33(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364085.html)**  and **[(3)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364085.html##d0e364101)**  had it been published prior to the relevant date referred to in **[Rule 64.1](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e374538.html##d0e374545)**  was published on a date which is the same as, or later than, the relevant date but was filed earlier than the relevant date or claimed the priority of an earlier application which had been filed prior to the relevant date, such published application or patent shall not be considered part of the prior art for the purposes of **[Article 33(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364085.html)**  and **[(3)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364085.html##d0e364101)**. Nevertheless, the international preliminary examination report shall call attention to such application or patent in the manner provided for in **[Rule 70.10](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e375320.html##d0e375522)**.

The objective of the international search is to discover relevant prior art (**[PCT Article 15(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363418.html)** ). "Prior art" consists of everything which has been made available to the public anywhere in the world by means of written disclosure (including drawings and other illustrations); it is relevant in respect of the international application if it is capable of being of assistance in determining that the claimed invention is or is not new and that the claimed invention does or does not involve an inventive step (i.e., that it is or is not obvious), and if the making available to the public occurred prior to the international filing date for the purposes of the international search report and prior to the earliest validly claimed priority date for the purposes of the written opinion of the International Searching Authority. For further details, see **[PCT Rules 33](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e370327.html)**, **[43bis.1(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e371120.html##d0e371129)**  and **[64](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e374538.html)**.

A written disclosure, i.e., a document, is regarded as made available to the public if, at the relevant date, it was possible for members of the public to gain access to the content of the document and to acquire possession of the content of the document, and there was no bar of confidentiality restricting the use or dissemination of knowledge gained thereby. Where the document only provides the month or the year, but not the specific date, which the document was made available to the public, the content of the document is presumed to have been made available to the public on the last day of that month or that year, respectively, unless evidence is provided to prove otherwise.

Prior art disclosure on the Internet or on an online database is considered in the same manner as other forms of written disclosure. Information disclosed on the Internet or an online database is considered to be publicly available as of the date the disclosure was publicly posted. Where the examiner obtains an electronic document that establishes the publication date for the Internet disclosure, he/she should make a printout of this document, which must mention both the URL of the relevant Internet disclosure and the date of publication of that relevant Internet disclosure. The examiner must then cite this printout in the international search report as an "L" document and cite the relevant Internet disclosure according to the relevance of its content ("X", "Y", "A") and according to the date as established ("X", "Y", "A", "P,X", "P,Y", "P,A", "E", etc.). See **[MPEP § 1844.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e172999.html)**, subsection VII. Where the examiner is unable to establish the publication date of the relevant Internet disclosure and it is relevant to the inventive step and/or novelty of the claimed invention, he/she should cite it in the international search report as a category "L" document for those claims which it would have affected if it were published in time, giving the date the document was printed out as its publication date.

Examiners are also encouraged to cite prior art that might be of assistance in determining whether other requirements are fulfilled, such as sufficient support of the claims by the description and industrial applicability. The examiner should also note any documents that may be of importance for other reasons, such as documents putting doubt upon the validity of any priority claimed, documents contributing to a better or more correct understanding of the claimed invention, and documents illustrating the technological background, but the examiner should not spend time in searching for these documents, nor the consideration of such matters unless there is a special reason for doing so in a particular case. Documents which do not qualify as prior art because they post-date the claimed invention may nevertheless be cited to show a universal fact, such as characteristics or properties of a material, or a specific scientific fact, or to show the level of ordinary skill in the art. Furthermore, examiners must recognize that different designated Offices may have different definitions of what is the effective date of prior art. Accordingly, when performing the search, examiners should be mindful to pick out and select for citation, where appropriate, prior art which may be relevant in offices other than the one in which they are situated. However, the examiner need not expand the search beyond the standard search parameters to discover such art. Where the search has been performed and such potentially relevant prior art has been identified, examiners are encouraged to, for example, cite all relevant art published prior to the international filing date even if that art and the international application under consideration have common applicants and/or inventors. As such, if the examiner is basing the international search on a prior search performed in a prior related U.S. national application, it may be necessary for the examiner to review the prior art published within the time period of the one year preceding the filing date of the prior U.S. application for any written disclosures based on the applicant’s own work that may have been published within that time period. Any such documents are considered prior art in an international application and are cited on the international search report even though they do not meet the definition of prior art in the prior U.S. national application. A further objective of the international search is to avoid, or at least minimize, additional searching at the national stage.

The international search is made on the basis of the claims, with due regard to the description and the drawings (if any) contained in the international application (**[PCT Article 15(3)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363418.html)** ) and should cover the entire subject matter to which the claims are directed or to which they might reasonably be expected to be directed after they have been amended (**[PCT Rule 33.3(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e370327.html##d0e370384)** ).

The relevant date for the purpose of considering prior art for the purposes of establishment of the written opinion of the International Searching Authority is defined in **[PCT Rule 64.1(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e374538.html##d0e374545)**  as the international filing date or, where the international application contains a claim for priority, the date provided in **[PCT Rule 64.1(b)(ii) - (iii)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e374538.html##d0e374545)**. See **[MPEP § 1878.01(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e187509.html)**.

In establishment of the written opinion, when determining whether there is inventive step, account should be taken of what the applicant acknowledges in his/her description as known. Such admissions should be regarded as correct and used when considering whether the claimed invention lacks novelty and/or inventive step where appropriate.

A non-written disclosure such as an oral disclosure, use, exhibition or other means of disclosure is not relevant prior art for the purposes of the international search unless it is substantiated by a written disclosure made available to the public prior to the international filing date and it is the written disclosure which constitutes the prior art. However, if the date on which the written disclosure was made available to the public was on or after the filing date of the international application under consideration, the search report should separately mention that fact and the date on which the written disclosure was available, even though such a written disclosure does not meet the definition of relevant prior art in the international phase, so long as the non-written disclosure was made available to the public on a date prior to the international filing date since such a non-written disclosure may be considered to be prior art under national law in the national phase. See **[PCT Rules 33.1(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e370327.html##d0e370334)**, **[64.2](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e374538.html##d0e374576)**  and **[70.9](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e375320.html##d0e375509)**.

##    **DOCUMENTS AND DATABASES SEARCHED BY THE INTERNATIONAL SEARCHING AUTHORITY**

The International Searching Authority must endeavor to discover as much of the relevant prior art as its facilities permit (**[PCT Article 15(4)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363418.html)** ), and, in any case, must consult the so-called "minimum documentation" (**[PCT Rule 34](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e370400.html)** ).

Even though completeness should be the ultimate goal of the international search, this goal may at times be difficult to obtain, because of such factors as text search limitations and the inevitable imperfections of any classification system and its implementation. The examiner therefore consults the appropriate minimum documentation and the most relevant search resources for the technology, including databases listed in the U.S. Search Guidance index (available through the USPTO Intranet website), and organizes the search effort and utilizes the search time in such a manner as to reduce to a minimum the possibility of failing to discover existing highly relevant prior art, such as art that fully anticipates any claims.

When conducting the search, it may be necessary to make use of the Internet as a search tool. Where the international application has not yet been published at the time of the search, there exists the danger that search terms used in the search on non-secure Internet search engines or in databases available on the Internet may be observed by third parties. Accordingly, all websites must be treated as non-secure unless the Office has a commercial arrangement with a service provider in order to maintain confidentiality and a secure connection to that website. Consequently, extreme caution must be exercised when using the Internet as a search tool where (as in most cases) the international application has not yet been published. Where a relevant database is accessible via the Internet, but an alternative secure connection to the same database is accessible, the secure connection must be used. Where no secure connection to a database on the Internet is available, the search may be conducted on the Internet using generalized search terms representing combinations of features that relate to the claimed invention, which have already been shown to exist in the state of the art.

    See **[PCT Rule 39](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e370715.html)**. In addition, the examiner is not required to search the international application, to the extent that a meaningful search cannot be carried out, in certain cases where a nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence listing is not furnished in the required form, language and manner. See Administrative Instructions Section **[513(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e283259.html)**. However, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has declared that it will search and examine all subject matter searched and examined in U.S. national applications.
    
    The applicant considering the filing of an international application may be well advised not to file one if the subject matter of the application falls into one of the above mentioned areas. If the applicant still does file, the International Searching Authority may declare that it will not establish an international search report. Accordingly, applicant should take into consideration which International Searching Authority (e.g., European Patent Office) is selected to conduct the international search. It is to be noted, nevertheless, that the lack of the international search report in such case will not have, in itself, any influence on the validity of the international application and the latter’s processing will continue, including its communication to the designated Offices.
    

# 1843.03    No Search Required if Claims Are Unclear [R-07.2022]

If the International Searching Authority considers that the description, the claims, or the drawings fail to comply with the prescribed requirements to such an extent that a meaningful search could not be carried out, it may declare that it will not establish a search report (**[PCT Article 17(2)(a)(ii)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363501.html)** ). Further, for applications having an international filing date on or after January 1, 2004, if the International Searching Authority considers that the description, claims, or drawings are so unclear, or the claims are so inadequately supported by the description that no meaningful opinion can be formed on the novelty, inventive step (non-obviousness), or industrial applicability of the claimed invention, the Authority shall not go into these issues in its written opinion with regard to the claims so affected (**[PCT Rules 43bis.1(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e371120.html##d0e371129)**  and **[66.1(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e374653.html##d0e374660)** ). For example, the examiner may determine that a meaningful search cannot be carried out or that no meaningful opinion can be formed in certain cases where a nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence listing is not furnished in the required form, language and manner. See Administrative Instructions Section **[513(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e283259.html)**  and **[MPEP § 1848](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e175064.html)**. Further, the examiner may determine that a meaningful search cannot be carried out or that no meaningful opinion can be formed for improper multiple dependent claims (see **[PCT Rule 6.4(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e366517.html##d0e366588)** ).

# 1843.04    Procedure for Claims Not Required To Be Searched and for Claims That Are Unclear [R-07.2015]

The International Searching Authority (ISA) may declare that a meaningful search cannot be carried out with respect to some of the claims only and/or that only certain claims relate to subject matter which the ISA is not required to and has decided not to search. Where only some of the claims will not be searched, the ISA searches the remaining claims of the international application. Any unsearched claims and the reasons why those claims have not been searched are indicated in Box No. II of the international search report (Form PCT/ISA/210).

If the examiner determines that none of the claims will be searched, the examiner declares that no search report will be established using Form PCT/ISA/203. The lack of the international search report will not, in itself, have any influence on the validity of the international application and the latter’s processing will continue, including its communication to the designated Offices.

If the international application cites a document that is not published or otherwise not accessible to the ISA and the document appears essential to a correct understanding of the invention to the extent that a meaningful international search would not be possible without knowledge of the content of that document, the ISA may postpone the search and request that the applicant first provide first a copy of the document, if possible to do so within the time limits for the preparation of the international search report of the ISA under the PCT. If no copy of the document is received, the ISA should first attempt to carry out the international search and then, if necessary, indicate that no meaningful search could be carried out in total or that the search needed to be restricted.

The ISA establishes the written opinion of the International Searching Authority (Form PCT/ISA/237) at the same time it establishes either the international search report (Form PCT/ISA/210) or the declaration of non-establishment of the international search report (Form PCT/ISA/203). However, if the ISA determines that for any or all claims (A) the international application relates to subject matter for which it is not required to establish a written opinion concerning novelty, inventive step and industrial applicability, (B) the description, claims, or drawings, are so unclear, or the claims are so inadequately supported by the description, that no meaningful opinion can be formed on the novelty, inventive step, or industrial applicability, of the claimed invention, or (C) the subject matter of the claims relates to inventions for which no international search report will be established, the ISA indicates, in Box No. III of the written opinion of the International Searching Authority (Form PCT/ISA/237), that no opinion with regard to novelty, inventive step or industrial applicability will be established with regard to those claims. In most instances it will be sufficient for the examiner to (A) indicate that no international search report has been established for the relevant claims as the reason for not establishing an opinion on novelty, inventive step, and industrial applicability and (B) refer to the international search report or declaration of non-establishment of the international search report for further details.

# 1843.05    Time Limit for Establishing the International Search Report and the Written Opinion of the International Searching Authority [R-07.2015]

Publication of the international application occurs at 18 months from the earliest priority date or, where there is no priority date, 18 months from the international filing date. The international search report is subject to international publication. For international applications filed before July 1, 2014, the written opinion of the International Searching Authority (ISA) is not published but is made available to the public after the expiration of 30 months from the priority date. See former PCT Rule 44_ter_. For international applications filed on or after July 1, 2014, the written opinion of the ISA and any informal comments submitted by the applicant will be made available to the public in their original language as of the publication date. The Office goal is to have the search report and written opinion mailed in sufficient time to reach the International Bureau by the end of 16 months from the priority date or 9 months from the filing date if no priority claim is made. This is necessary since the technical preparations for publication are completed by 17.5 months from the earliest priority date. In view of the treaty mandated publication and the time needed for technical preparation, the Office sets time periods for completion of the search report and the written opinion which will ensure sufficient time to complete internal processing and review and achieve receipt of the search report and the written opinion at the International Bureau by the 16th month from the priority date. See **[PCT Rule 42.1](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e370881.html##d0e370888)**  and **[43 bis.1(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e371120.html##d0e371129)**.

# 1844    The International Search Report [R-07.2015]

#### _PCT Article 18_

#### _The International Search Report_

- (1) The international search report shall be established within the prescribed time limit and in the prescribed form.
- (2) The international search report shall, as soon as it has been established, be transmitted by the International Searching Authority to the applicant and the International Bureau.
- (3) The international search report or the declaration referred to in **[Article 17(2)(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363501.html)**  shall be translated as provided in the Regulations. The translations shall be prepared by or under the responsibility of the International Bureau.

The results of the international search are recorded in the international search report (Form PCT/ISA/210), which, together with the written opinion of the International Searching Authority (Form PCT/ISA/237) is transmitted with Form PCT/ISA/220. The search report will be published by the International Bureau and, together with the written opinion of the International Searching Authority, will serve as a basis for examination of the international application by the designated Offices and the International Preliminary Examining Authority.

The search report is only for the purpose of identifying prior art and should not contain any expressions of opinion, reasoning, argument or explanation as to any cited prior art. Such comments should be included in the written opinion of the International Searching Authority.

The printed international search report form (Form PCT/ISA/210) to be transmitted to the applicant and to the International Bureau contains two main sheets ("first sheet" and "second sheet") to be used for all searches. These two main sheets are intended for recording the important features of the search such as the fields searched and for citing documents revealed by the search. The printed international search report form also contains five optional continuation sheets for use where necessary. They are the: "continuation of first sheet (1)," "continuation of first sheet (2)," "continuation of first sheet (3)," "continuation of second sheet" and "patent family annex," respectively. The patent family annex sheet is not currently used by the United States International Searching Authority since patent family information is not readily available to the examiner. The "continuation of first sheet (1)" is to be used only when the international application includes a nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence and indicates the basis on which the international search was carried out, since the relevant listings may be filed or furnished at different times and in different forms. The "continuation of first sheet (2)" is used where an indication is made on the first sheet that claims were found unsearchable (item 2) and/or unity of invention is lacking (item 3). The relevant indications must then be made on that continuation sheet. The "continuation of first sheet (3)" is to contain the text of the abstract where an abstract or an amended abstract has been established by the International Searching Authority (item 5) and an indication to that effect is made on the first sheet. The "continuation of second sheet" is to be used where the space on the second sheet is insufficient for the citation of documents. The form also includes an "extra sheet" which may be used whenever additional space is required to complete information from the other sheets.

It is to be noted that only the "second sheet", the "continuation of second sheet" (if any), the "continuation of first sheet (2)" (if any), and the "extra sheet" (if any), as well as any separate sheet with information on members of patent families, will be the subject of international publication, as the "first sheet," "continuation of first sheet (1)" (if any), and the "continuation of first sheet (3)" (if any) contain only information which will already appear on the front page of the publication of the international application (**[PCT Rule 48.2(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e371853.html##d0e371871)** ).

##    **CONTENTS OF THE INTERNATIONAL SEARCH REPORT**

The international search report (**[PCT Rule 43](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e370901.html)** ) contains, among other things, the citations of the documents considered to be relevant (**[PCT Rule 43.5](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e370901.html##d0e370981)**  and Administrative Instructions Section **[503](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e282967.html)** ), the classification of the subject matter of the invention (**[PCT Rule 43.3](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e370901.html##d0e370928)**  and Administrative Instructions Section **[504](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e282985.html)** ) and an indication of the fields searched (**[PCT Rule 43.6](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e370901.html##d0e371009)** ). Citations of particular relevance must be specially indicated (Administrative Instructions Section **[505](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e283013.html)** ); citations of certain special categories of documents are also indicated (Administrative Instructions Section **[507](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e283048.html)** ); citations which are not relevant to all the claims must be cited in relation to the claim or claims to which they are relevant (Administrative Instructions Section **[508](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e283107.html)** ); if only certain passages of the cited document are particularly relevant, they must be identified, for example, by indicating the page, the column or the lines, where the passage appears (**[PCT Rule 43.5(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e370901.html##d0e370981)** ).

# 1844.01    Preparing the International Search Report (Form PCT/ISA/210) [R-07.2022]

[Editor Note: This section discusses the July 2022 version of PCT/ISA/210. For international applications having an international filing date before July 1, 2022, information regarding form PCT/ISA/210 (revised January 2019) may be found in §1844.01 of the 10.2019 revision of the Ninth Edition of the MPEP published June 2020 at: **[www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/old/ mpep_E9R10.htm](https://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/old/mpep_E9R10-2019.htm)**.]

The first sheet of the international search report indicates the total number of sheets in the report. The correct number is entered, not including sheets that have not been filled-in (blank sheets). The number of sheets only includes the number of sheets from Form PCT/ISA/210.

## I.    **BASIS OF THE REPORT**

## A.    **_Box 1a – Language_**

In most circumstances, the first box under box 1a is checked indicating that the search is carried out on the basis of the international application in the language in which it was filed. Alternatively, the second box under box 1a is checked and an indication of English made when the search is on the basis of a translation of the international application into English.

## B.    **_Box 1b – Rectification of an Obvious Mistake_**

Where the application includes the rectification of an obvious mistake authorized by or notified to the International Searching Authority under **[PCT Rule 91](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377673.html)**, box 1b of the first sheet is checked. The authorization or notification will generally be indicated on a Notification of Decision Concerning Request for Rectification (Form PCT/RO/109 or PCT/ISA/217) (see **[MPEP § 1836](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e171114.html)**).

## C.    **_Box 1c And Box No. I – Nucleotide and/or Amino Acid Sequence Listings_**

Where the application discloses any nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence, box 1c of the first sheet is checked and Box No. I (appearing on "continuation of first sheet (1)") indicates in items 1.a and 1.b whether the sequence listing was filed as part of the international application or subsequent to the international filing date for the purpose of international search and whether it was accompanied by the required statement to the effect that the sequence listing does not go beyond the disclosure in the international application as filed.

Item 2 indicates the report was established to the extent that a meaningful search could be carried out without a WIPO Standard ST.26 compliant sequence listing. Item 3 indicates any additional comments.

## II.    **BOX 2 AND BOX NO. II – LIMITATION OF THE SUBJECT OF THE INTERNATIONAL SEARCH**

The report indicates whether any claims are unsearchable for any of the reasons indicated below. If any such limitations of the subject of the search are applied, the claims in respect of which a search has not been carried out are identified and the reasons for this are indicated. The three categories where such limitations may arise are:

- (A) claims drawn to subject matter not required to be searched by the International Searching Authority (see **[MPEP § 1843.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e172603.html)**);
- (B) claims in respect of which a meaningful search cannot be carried out (see **[MPEP § 1843.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e172803.html)**); and
- (C) multiple dependent claims which do not comply with **[PCT Rule 6.4(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e366517.html##d0e366588)**  (see **[MPEP § 1843.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e172803.html)**).

Where claims are not searched for any of the reasons identified in (A)-(C) above, box 2 of the first sheet of the international search report is checked. In addition, Box No. II of the international search report (on "continuation of first sheet (2)") is completed, giving the details.

## III.    **BOX 3 AND BOX NO. III – LACK OF UNITY OF THE CLAIMED INVENTION**

The report indicates whether the search is limited due to a lack of unity of invention. If unity is lacking, the claims in respect of which a search has not been carried out are identified and the reasons for this are indicated.

Where lack of unity has been found (see **[MPEP § 1850](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e175250.html)**), box 3 of the first sheet of the international search report is checked. In addition, Box No. III of the international search report (on "continuation of first sheet (2)") is completed, irrespective of whether an invitation to pay additional search fees has issued. The search report indicates the separate inventions claimed in the application, whether additional search fees were requested and paid, and which claims were searched. It also indicates whether any additional search fees were accompanied by a protest.

An explanation of the separate inventions is entered in the appropriate area in Box No. III (see **[MPEP § 1850](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e175250.html)**).

If applicant paid all the required additional search fees for additional inventions, the examiner should check item 1 under Box No. III indicating that the international search report covers all searchable claims.

If the examiner did not invite payment of additional search fees, item 2 should be checked under Box. No. III and the international search report will cover all searchable claims.

If, in response to a lack of unity of invention, applicant paid only some of the required additional search fees for additional inventions, the examiner should check item 3 under Box No. III and indicate the claims for which fees were paid and therefore, covered by the international search.

If, in response to a lack of unity of invention, no required additional search fees were timely paid by the applicant, then the international search report is restricted to the invention first mentioned in the claims. The examiner should check item 4 under Box No. III and indicate the claims limited to the first mentioned invention that are covered by the international search report.

Regarding the three boxes indicating a Remark on Protest, the first box would be checked if the payment of any additional search fees is accompanied by a protest. The second box would not be checked since the ISA/US does not require a protest fee. The third box would be checked if the payment of any additional search fees is not accompanied by a protest. See **[MPEP § 1850](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e175250.html)**, subsection X., for a discussion of protest procedure.

## IV.    **TITLE, ABSTRACT, AND FIGURE FOR PUBLICATION**

The international application must contain an abstract and a title. The examiner considers the abstract (together with the title of the invention and the figure of the drawings to be published with the abstract) in relation to the requirements of the Regulations under the PCT. The examiner indicates approval or amendment of the title of the invention, the text of the abstract, and the selection of the figure that is to accompany the abstract in items 4 to 6 of the first sheet of the international search report.

## A.    **_Box 4 - Title_**

#### _PCT Rule 4_

#### _The Request (Contents)_

*****

# 4.3 Title of the Invention

The title of the invention shall be short (preferably from two to seven words when in English or translated into English) and precise.

*****

#### _PCT Rule 37_

#### _Missing or Defective Title_

# 37.1 Lack of Title

If the international application does not contain a title and the receiving Office has notified the International Searching Authority that it has invited the applicant to correct such defect, the International Searching Authority shall proceed with the international search unless and until it receives notification that the said application is considered withdrawn.

# 37.2 Establishment of Title

If the international application does not contain a title and the International Searching Authority has not received a notification from the receiving Office to the effect that the applicant has been invited to furnish a title, or if the said Authority finds that the title does not comply with **[Rule 4.3](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e365863.html##d0e365979)**, it shall itself establish a title. Such title shall be established in the language in which the international application is to be published or, if a translation into another language was transmitted under **[Rule 23.1(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e369309.html##d0e369316)**  and the International Searching Authority so wishes, in the language of that translation.

The title must be short and precise (preferably from two to seven words in English or when translated into English). Furthermore, the title should clearly and concisely state the technical designation of the invention. In this regard the following should be taken into account:

- (A) personal names or trade names or similar terms of non-technical nature which do not serve to identify the invention should not be used;
- (B) the abbreviation "etc.," being vague, should not be used and should be replaced by an indication of what it is intended to cover;
- (C) titles such as "Method," "Apparatus," "Chemical Compounds" alone or similar vague titles do not clearly state the technical designation of the invention and should not be used.

In general, the examiner is required to draft a new title if the applicant failed to provide a title or if the title is deficient because it does not comply with the requirements of **[PCT Rule 4.3](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e365863.html##d0e365979)**. The examiner is not required to gain the applicant’s approval of the new title established by the examiner.

On the first sheet of the international search report, the examiner indicates the title text is approved (the first box under Box 4) or has been established (the second box under Box 4).

## B.    **_Box 5 and Box 6 - Abstract and Figure for Publication_**

#### _PCT Rule 8_

#### _The Abstract_

# 8.1 Contents and Form of the Abstract

- (a) The abstract shall consist of the following:
    - (i) a summary of the disclosure as contained in the description, the claims, and any drawings; the summary shall indicate the technical field to which the invention pertains and shall be drafted in a way which allows the clear understanding of the technical problem, the gist of the solution of that problem through the invention, and the principal use or uses of the invention;
    - (ii) where applicable, the chemical formula which, among all the formulae contained in the international application, best characterizes the invention.
- (b) The abstract shall be as concise as the disclosure permits (preferably 50 to 150 words if it is in English or when translated into English).
- (c) The abstract shall not contain statements on the alleged merits or value of the claimed invention or on its speculative application.
- (d) Each main technical feature mentioned in the abstract and illustrated by a drawing in the international application shall be followed by a reference sign, placed between parentheses.

# 8.2 Figure

- (a) If the applicant fails to make the indication referred to in **[Rule 3.3(a)(iii)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e365795.html##d0e365822)**, or if the International Searching Authority finds that a figure or figures other than that figure or those figures suggested by the applicant would, among all the figures of all the drawings, better characterize the invention, it shall, subject to paragraph (b), indicate the figure or figures which should accompany the abstract when the latter is published by the International Bureau. In such case, the abstract shall be accompanied by the figure or figures so indicated by the International Searching Authority. Otherwise, the abstract shall, subject to paragraph (b), be accompanied by the figure or figures suggested by the applicant.
- (b) If the International Searching Authority finds that none of the figures of the drawings is useful for the understanding of the abstract, it shall notify the International Bureau accordingly. In such case, the abstract, when published by the International Bureau, shall not be accompanied by any figure of the drawings even where the applicant has made a suggestion under **[Rule 3.3(a)(iii)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e365795.html##d0e365822)**.

*****

#### _PCT Rule 38_

#### _Missing or Defective Abstract_

# 38.1 Lack of Abstract

If the international application does not contain an abstract and the receiving Office has notified the International Searching Authority that it has invited the applicant to correct such defect, the International Searching Authority shall proceed with the international search unless and until it receives notification that the said application is considered withdrawn.

# 38.2 Establishment of Abstract

If the international application does not contain an abstract and the International Searching Authority has not received a notification from the receiving Office to the effect that the applicant has been invited to furnish an abstract, or if the said Authority finds that the abstract does not comply with **[Rule 8](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e366660.html)**, it shall itself establish an abstract. Such abstract shall be established in the language in which the international application is to be published or, if a translation into another language was transmitted under **[Rule 23.1(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e369309.html##d0e369316)**  and the International Searching Authority so wishes, in the language of that translation.

# 38.3 Modification of Abstract

- The applicant may, until the expiration of one month from the date of mailing of the international search report, submit to the International Searching Authority:
    
    - (i) proposed modifications of the abstract; or
    - (ii) where the abstract has been established by the Authority, proposed modifications of, or comments on, that abstract, or both modifications and comments;
    
    and the Authority shall decide whether to modify the abstract accordingly. Where the Authority modifies the abstract, it shall notify the modification to the International Bureau.
    

In general, the examiner will have to establish a new abstract if the applicant did not provide an abstract or if the abstract does not comply with **[PCT Rule 8](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e366660.html)**. In determining the definitive contents of the abstract, or establishing the text of the abstract anew where it is missing, the examiner should take into consideration the fact that the abstract is merely for use as technical information and, in particular, must not be used for the purpose of interpreting the scope of the protection sought. The abstract constitutes an efficient instrument for the purpose of assisting the scientist, engineer, or researcher in searching in the particular technical field and should in particular make it possible to assess whether there is need for consulting the international application itself. WIPO guidelines for the preparation of abstracts are found in WIPO Standard ST.12/A, which is available from WIPO’s website (**[www.wipo.int/standards/ en/part_03_standards.html](http://www.wipo.int/standards/en/part_03_standards.html)** ).

In considering the adequacy of the applicant’s abstract and figure, because of practical difficulties experienced by the International Bureau with publication, examiners should have particular regard to the following:

- (A) It is important that the abstract be as concise as the disclosure permits (preferably 50 to 150 words if it is in English or when translated into English). Within this constraint the abstract must provide a summary of the technical information about the disclosure as contained in the description, claims, and drawings. It should be drafted so as to serve as an efficient scanning tool for searching purposes in the art.
- (B) Phrases should not be used which can be implied, such as "This disclosure concerns," "The invention defined by this disclosure," and "This invention relates to."
- (C) Only one figure should normally be selected unless this would lead to inadequate disclosure. The inclusion of more than two figures should not be considered except in extreme circumstances where necessary information cannot be otherwise conveyed. Where none of the figures is considered useful for the understanding of the invention (even where the applicant has suggested a figure), no figure should be selected.
- (D) Abstracts may be incomprehensible if the numerals of the selected figure(s) do not correspond with those in the abstract. Thus, this should be avoided.
- (E) An absence of reference numbers on the figures must be accepted as the examiner has no mechanism to initiate their addition.
- (F) Each main technical feature mentioned in the abstract and illustrated by a drawing should be followed by a reference sign, placed between parentheses.

In box 5 of the first sheet of the international search report, the examiner indicates approval of the text of the abstract by checking the first box. When the text of the abstract is missing or defective the second box is checked and the new abstract is established by entering the text of the new abstract. The defect or reason for establishing the new abstract should be indicated, e.g., too long or missing.

The applicant may submit modifications of the abstract until the expiration of one month from the date of mailing of the search report. If the examiner establishes a new abstract, the applicant may propose modifications of, and/or comment on, the new abstract after it has been established in the international search report. The applicant is allowed one month from the date of mailing of the international search report to respond to the examiner’s abstract in the report. If the applicant does comment, the examiner takes the applicant’s comments into consideration. It is not necessary for the examiner to reply to the applicant’s comments even if adverse. If the examiner decides to amend the abstract established in the international search report based on the proposed modifications and/or comment, the International Bureau and the applicant are notified using Form PCT/ISA/205. See **[PCT Rule 38.3](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e370660.html##d0e370693)**  and Administrative Instructions Section **[515](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e283351.html)**.

When indicating the figure to be published, the applicant’s suggestion is found in Box No. IX of the request (Form PCT/RO/101). Where none of the figures is considered useful for the understanding of the abstract, this is indicated at the appropriate box (box 6b of the first sheet of Form PCT/ISA/210). When no drawings accompany the application, none of the boxes are checked. Otherwise, box 6a is checked and the reason for selecting the figure to be published is indicated, i.e., as suggested by the applicant, as selected by the examiner because either the applicant failed to suggest a figure in Box No. IX of Form PCT/RO/101 or the figure better characterizes the invention. It is not recommended to select more than one figure; however, if it is necessary to do so then the wording of the form should be changed to reflect the change from single case to plural case. For example, "figure" is changed to "figures", "is" to "are" and " No." to "Nos.".

## V.    **BOX A - CLASSIFICATION OF SUBJECT MATTER**

The International Searching Authority assigns obligatory International Patent Classification (IPC) symbols in accordance with the rules as set forth in the Guide to the IPC and in the IPC itself (using the edition of the IPC in force at the time), whereby the technical subject of the invention of the application is identified. The International Searching Authority then records the International Patent Classification and the Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC) as required by the ISA/US in Box A of the second sheet of the international search report. The IPC Guide can be accessed via the Patent Examiner’s Toolkit under Classification Tools or via WIPO’s website (**[www.wipo.int/classifications/ipc/en/](http://www.wipo.int/classifications/ipc/en/)** ).

## VI.    **BOX B - RECORDING THE SEARCH**

The examiner records the search history in Box B of the second sheet of the international search report. In recording the search history of the international search, the examiner lists the classification identification of the fields searched. Examiners are also encouraged to record the search history in sufficient detail to allow examiners of national stage applications to fully interpret and rely upon the international search. This includes recording the details of any patent and non-patent literature searches as well as searches conducted on the Internet.

Where the international search report is entirely or partly based on a previous search made for an application relating to a similar subject, the previous application number and the relevant search history consulted for this previous search is, where appropriate, identified as having been consulted for the international application in question, except in those instances where the details of an earlier search cannot be ascertained, or whenever it is impractical to record the full details of the earlier search. In the later case, a summary of the earlier search should be included. Where the previous application has been published, this information is recorded in the international search report.

The USPTO in its capacity as the International Searching Authority makes a separate detailed search history of record in the applications. These search histories are mailed to applicants with the international search report.

## VII.    **BOX C - DOCUMENTS CONSIDERED TO BE RELEVANT**

The completion of Box C of the second sheet of the international search report can be considered as having three components. These are: (A) the citation category; (B) the citation of the document together with identification of the relevant passages where appropriate; and (C) the identification of relevant claim numbers. The citation of multiple documents showing the same inventive elements should be kept to a minimum. Further, when citing a document, the examiner should clearly indicate which portions of the document are most relevant.

## A.    **_Citation Category_**

Documents which are cited are given a category indication by way of an alphabetic character, details of which are given in PCT Administrative Instructions Sections **[505](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e283013.html)**  and **[507](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e283048.html)**  and below. The categories for citations are also explained under the "documents considered to be relevant" section of the report. A category should always be indicated for each document cited. Where needed, combinations of different categories are possible.

## 1.    **Particularly Relevant Documents**

Where a document cited in the international search report is particularly relevant, it is indicated by the letters "X" or "Y". Category "X" is applicable where a document is such that when taken alone, a claimed invention cannot be considered novel or where a document is such that when considered in light of common general knowledge, a claimed invention cannot be considered to involve an inventive step. Category "Y" is applicable where a document is such that a claimed invention cannot be considered to involve an inventive step when the document is combined with one or more other documents of the same category, such combination being obvious to a person skilled in the art.

## 2.    **Documents Defining the State of the Art and Not Prejudicing Novelty or Inventive Step**

Where a document cited in the international search report represents state of the art and is not prejudicial to the novelty or inventive step of the claimed invention, it is indicated by the letter "A".

## 3.    **Documents Which Refer to a Non-Written Disclosure**

Where a document cited in the international search report refers to a non-written disclosure referred to in **[PCT Rule 33.1(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e370327.html##d0e370334)**, the letter "O" is entered. Examples of such disclosures include conference proceedings. The document category "O" is always accompanied by a symbol indicating the relevance of the document, for example: "O,X", "O,Y", or "O,A".

## 4.    **Intermediate Documents**

Documents published on dates falling between the date of filing of the application being searched and the date of priority claimed, or the earliest priority if there is more than one (see **[PCT Article 2(xi)(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e362923.html)** ), are denoted by the letter "P". The letter "P" is also given to a document published on the very day of the earliest date of priority of the patent application under consideration. The document category "P" is always accompanied by a symbol indicating the relevance of the document, for example: "P,X", "P,Y", or "P,A".

## 5.    **Documents Relating to the Theory or Principle Underlying the Invention**

Where any document cited in the search report is a document that may be useful for a better understanding of the principle or theory underlying the invention, or is cited to show that the reasoning or the facts underlying the invention are incorrect, it is indicated by the letter "T".

## 6.    **Potentially Conflicting Patent Documents**

Any patent document bearing a filing or priority date earlier than the filing date of the application searched (not the priority date) but published on or later than that date and the content of which would constitute prior art relevant to novelty (**[PCT Article 33(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364085.html)** ) is indicated by the letter "E" (see PCT Administrative Instructions Section **[507(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e283048.html)**  and **[PCT Rule 33.1(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e370327.html##d0e370334)** ).

## 7.    **Documents Cited in the Application**

When the search report cites documents already mentioned in the description of the patent application for which the search is carried out, such documents are denoted by the letter "D". The document category "D" is always accompanied by a symbol indicating the relevance of the document, for example: "D,X", "D,Y", or "D,A".

## 8.    **Documents Cited for Other Reasons**

Where in the search report any document is cited for reasons other than those referred to in the foregoing paragraphs (in particular as evidence), for example:

- (A) a document which may throw doubt on a priority claim (Article 4(C)(4) of the Paris Convention), or
- (B) a document cited to establish the publication date of another citation,

the document is indicated by the letter "L". Brief reasons for citing the document should be given. Documents of this type need not be indicated as relevant to any particular claims. However, where the evidence that they provide relates only to certain claims (for example the "L" document cited in the search report may invalidate the priority in respect of certain claims and not others), then the citation of the document should refer to those claims.

## B.    **_Citation of the Documents_**

Identification of any document should be made according to WIPO Standard ST.14 (see PCT Administrative Instructions Section **[503](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e282967.html)** ). For "A" citations it is not necessary to indicate the relevant claims unless there is good reason to do so; for example where there is a clear lack of unity _a priori_ (see **[MPEP § 1850](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e175250.html)**) and the citation is relevant only to a particular claim or group of claims or when the claims meet the criteria of novelty, inventive step, and industrial applicability under **[PCT Article 33(2) to (4)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364085.html)**  and the "A" category citations represent the most relevant prior art. The box on the second sheet of Form PCT/ISA/210 entitled "Further documents listed are in the continuation of Box C" is checked if a continuation sheet is used to list additional documents that will not fit in the space provided in Box C.

## C.    **_Relationship Between Documents and Claims_**

Each citation should include a reference to the claims to which it relates (see PCT Administrative Instructions Section **[508](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e283107.html)** ). If necessary, various relevant parts of the document cited should each be related to the claims in like manner (with the exception of "L" documents and "A" documents). It is also possible for the same document to represent a different category with respect to different claims. For example:

WO1990/001867 A (WIDEGREN LARS (SE)) 8 March 1990 (08-03-1990), figures 1 and 2

X 1

Y 2-5

A 6-10

The above example means that Figures 1 and 2 of the cited document disclose subject matter which prejudices the novelty or inventive step of claim 1, which prejudices the inventive step of claims 2-5 when combined with another document cited in the search report, and which represents non-prejudicial state of the art for the subject matter of claims 6-10.

## VIII.    **FINALIZATION OF THE SEARCH REPORT**

The identification of the International Searching Authority which established the international search report and the date of actual completion, i.e., the date on which the report was drawn up are indicated at the bottom of the second sheet of the international search report. The international search report will be accompanied by a transmittal letter (Form PCT/ISA/220) indicating the date the search report was mailed to the applicant. See **[MPEP § 1845.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e174931.html)**.

Pursuant to **[PCT Rule 43.8](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e370901.html##d0e371069)**, the international search report must indicate the name of the officer of the International Searching Authority responsible for the report, i.e., the "authorized officer." An "authorized officer" is the person who actually performed the search work and prepared the search report, or another person who was responsible for supervising the search. See PCT Administrative Instructions Section **[514](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e283331.html)**. Thus, an examiner need not have signatory authority in order to be named as an authorized officer on the search report. However, the "file copy" of the search report must be signed by an examiner having at least partial signatory authority.

The international search report should be mailed within 3 months of receipt of the search copy or within 9 months from the priority date, whichever is later.

The examiner is required, in most instances, to establish a written opinion on novelty, inventive step, and industrial applicability of the claimed invention at the same time he/she establishes the international search report. The international search report and written opinion together serve to inform the International Preliminary Examining Authority of the documents and arguments necessary to complete the relevant assessments if international preliminary examination is demanded, and to inform the designated Offices of information that may be relevant to examination in the national phase. (The written opinion is transmitted to the designated offices in the form of an international preliminary report on patentability if no international preliminary examination report is established under Chapter II of the PCT). A written opinion of the International Searching Authority is not required in the limited instance where a demand for international preliminary examination and required fees (**[PCT Rule 69.1(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e375165.html##d0e375172)** ) have been filed with the United States International Preliminary Examining Authority and the examiner considers all the conditions of **[PCT Article 34(2)(c)(i) to (iii)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364117.html)**  to be fulfilled. In this limited instance, a positive international preliminary examination report may be issued. See **[PCT Rule 69.1(b-bis)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e375165.html##d0e375172)** ).

The applicant must be notified in the written opinion of the defects found in the application. The examiner is further required to fully state the reasons for his/her opinion (**[PCT Rules 66.1bis](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e374653.html##d0e374660)**   and **[66.2(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e374653.html##d0e374790)** ) and invite a written reply, with amendments where appropriate (**[PCT Rule 66.2(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e374653.html##d0e374790)** ).

# 1845.01    Preparing the Written Opinion of the International Searching Authority (Form PCT/ISA/237) [R-07.2022]

[Editor Note: This section discusses the July 2022 version of PCT/ISA/237. For international applications having an international filing date before July 1, 2022, information regarding form PCT/ISA/237 (revised January 2019) may be found in §1845.01 of the 10.2019 revision of the Ninth Edition of the MPEP published June 2020 at: **[www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/old/ mpep_E9R10.htm](https://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/old/mpep_E9R10-2019.htm)**.]

The classifications in the header on the cover sheet of Form PCT/ISA/237 are to be consistent with the classifications of subject matter in Box A on the second sheet of the International Search Report (Form PCT/ISA/210).

The Boxes marked on the cover sheet represent a summary of the indications detailed on the subsequent relevant sheets of Form PCT/ISA/237.

## I.    **BOX NO. I. — BASIS OF OPINION**

When completing Box No. I, item 1, of Form PCT/ISA/237, the examiner must indicate whether or not the opinion has been established on the basis of the international application in the language in which it was filed. If a translation was furnished for the purpose of the search, this must be indicated.

Box No. I, item 2 of Form PCT/ISA/237 is to be marked when the opinion is established taking into account the rectification of an obvious mistake under **[PCT Rule 91](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377673.html)**.

With respect to Box No. I, item 3 of Form PCT/ISA/237, if the opinion has been based on a nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence disclosed and necessary to the claimed invention, the examiner must indicate whether the sequence listing was filed as part of the international application or subsequent to the international filing date for the purpose of international search, and whether it was accompanied by the required statement to the effect that the sequence listing does not go beyond the disclosure in the international application as filed, if filed subsequent to the international filing date.

Item 4 indicates the opinion was established to the extent that a meaningful opinion could be formed without a WIPO Standard ST.26 compliant sequence listing. Item 5 is available for providing any additional comments.

## II.    **BOX NO. II. — PRIORITY**

Box No. II of Form PCT/ISA/237 is to inform applicant of the status of a request for priority. Where one or more citations of the international search report were published after the earliest priority date, the validity of that earliest priority date requires checking. Where the priority document is one which is in the records of the ISA, it should be obtained from those records. If a copy of the priority document is not available before preparation of the written opinion of the ISA because it has not yet been provided by the applicant, and if that earlier application was not filed with that Authority in its capacity as a national Office or the priority document is not available to that Authority from a digital library in accordance with the Administrative Instructions, the written opinion of the ISA may be established as if the priority had been validly claimed.

If the examiner needs a copy of a foreign priority document, the copy will be supplied on request to the International Bureau (IB) unless the IB has not yet received the priority document, in which case the examiner may invite the applicant to furnish such a copy. See **[PCT Rule 66.7(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e374653.html##d0e374929)**. The examiner may consult with the Technology Center Quality Assurance Specialist or PCT Special Program Examiner regarding requesting a copy of the priority document from the IB. If the priority document is not in English, the examiner may invite the applicant to furnish a translation of the priority document within two months of the invitation. See **[PCT Rule 66.7(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e374653.html##d0e374929)**. Box No. II, item 3, "Additional Observations" may be used to invite applicant to supply a copy of the priority document and/or translation. Preparation of the written opinion by the International Searching Authority should not be delayed to await a response to the invitation. The written opinion of the ISA will ordinarily be established as if the priority claim had been validly claimed even though the copy and/or translation has not been furnished. However, failure to timely furnish a copy of the priority document and/or translation may result in any further written opinion or international preliminary examination report of the International Preliminary Examining Authority being established as if the priority had not been claimed.

If applicant fails to furnish a copy or translation of the earlier application, whose priority has been claimed, check item 1 and then check the first box of the subsection if applicant failed to furnish a copy of the earlier application whose priority has been claimed, and check the second box of the subsection if applicant failed to furnish a translation of the earlier application whose priority has been claimed.

When the claim for priority has been found invalid (e.g., the notification under **[PCT Rule 26bis.2(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e369679.html##d0e369717)**  has been provided or all claims are directed to inventions which were not described and enabled by the earlier application), check item 2 in Box II and indicate why the claim for priority has been found invalid following item 3 "Additional observations."

## III.    **BOX NO. III. — NON-ESTABLISHMENT OF OPINION ON NOVELTY, INVENTIVE STEP AND INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY**

Box No. III of Form PCT/ISA/237 is intended to cover situations where some or all claims of an application are so unclear or inadequately supported by the description that the question of novelty, inventive step (nonobviousness), and industrial applicability cannot be considered, or where the international application or claims thereof relate to subject matter for which it is not required to establish a written opinion concerning novelty, inventive step and industrial applicability, or where no international search report has been established for the claims.

If some or all of the claims of an application relate to subject matter for which it is not required to establish a written opinion concerning novelty, inventive step and industrial applicability, check the appropriate box, indicate which claims relate to that subject matter and specify the reasons e.g., improper multiple dependent claims that fail to comply with **[PCT Rule 6.4](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e366517.html##d0e366588)**.

If some or all of the claims of an application are so unclear that no meaningful opinion could be formed, check the appropriate box, indicate which claims are unclear and specify the reasons.

If some or all of the claims are so inadequately supported by the description that no meaningful opinion could be formed, check the appropriate box.

If no international search report has been established for certain claims, check the appropriate box and indicate the claim numbers.

If a meaningful opinion could not be formed without the nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence listing because it does not comply with WIPO Standard ST.26, and/or the applicant did not pay the late furnishing fee, if required, the examiner must indicate the reason for the non-compliance.

## IV.    **BOX NO. IV. — LACK OF UNITY OF INVENTION**

Box No. IV of Form PCT/ISA/237 should be used by the examiner to notify applicant that lack of unity has been found by checking item 1, and one of the four boxes under item 1.

If applicant paid additional fees for additional inventions, the examiner should check the first box under item 1.

If the additional fees were paid under protest, the examiner should check the second box under item 1.

Regarding the third box, since the ISA/US does not require a protest fee, this box would not be checked.

If the search report is based on the first mentioned invention (no additional search fees were paid), the examiner should check the fourth box under item 1.

Item 2 of Box No. IV is to be completed if the examiner determines that unity of invention is lacking but chooses not to invite the applicant to agree to a search limited to the first mentioned invention or pay additional fees.

If a lack of unity exists, the examiner would mark the second box under item 3. However, since the reasons for the lack of unity have already been set forth on the simultaneously issued international search report, the examiner can simply state that the reason the requirement of unity of invention is not complied with is set forth in the international search report. The first box under item 3 would never be marked.

Item 4 is used by the examiner to indicate which parts of the application form the basis of the opinion after the lack of unity of invention has been explained. The first box should be checked when the opinion is established for all parts. Otherwise, the second box is checked and the relevant claims identified.

## V.    **BOX NO. V. — REASONED STATEMENT WITH REGARD TO NOVELTY, INVENTIVE STEP, AND INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY OF CLAIMS**

In Box No. V of Form PCT/ISA/237, the examiner must list in summary form all claims with regard to the criteria of novelty (N), inventive step (IS), and industrial applicability (IA). For definitions of novelty, inventive step, and industrial applicability see **[MPEP §§ 1878.01(a)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e187677.html)**, **[1878.01(a)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e187723.html)**, and **[1878.01(a)(3)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e187807.html)**, respectively.

Box No. V is the main purpose of the written opinion. All claims without fatal defects are treated on the merits in Box No. V as to novelty, inventive step (nonobviousness) and industrial applicability.

The treatment of claims in Box No. V is similar in format to an Office action in a U.S. national patent application except that the words "rejection," "patentability," and "allowable are never used in a written opinion. On the international level, all written opinions are nonbinding and a patent does not issue; what does issue is an international preliminary report on patentability (IPRP), which is nonbinding on the elected States.

Examiner statements in Box No. V can be positive or negative. If the claims define over the prior art and meet the test of novelty, inventive step (nonobviousness) and industrial applicability, a positive statement equivalent to detailed reasons for allowance in a corresponding U.S. national application should be provided, indicating how the claims meet the tests of novelty, inventive step and industrial applicability. Form paragraphs **[18.04](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//fp18.04.html)** and **[18.04.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//fp18.04.01.html)** may be used for this purpose.

# ¶ 18.04    Meets Novelty and Inventive Step

Claim **[1]** the criteria set out in **[PCT Article 33(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364085.html)** -**[(3)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364434.html)**, because the prior art does not teach or fairly suggest **[2]**.

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 1, pluralize "claim" if needed, insert claim no.(s), and insert the verb --meet-- or --meets--, as appropriate.

2. In bracket 2, insert the details of the claimed subject matter that render it unobvious over the prior art.

3. If the claims also meet the industrial applicability criteria set out in **[PCT Article 33(4)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364085.html)**, this form paragraph should be followed by form paragraph **[18.04.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//fp18.04.01.html)**.

4. If the claims do not meet the industrial applicability criteria set out in **[PCT Article 33(4)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364085.html)**, this form paragraph should be followed by form paragraph **[18.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//fp18.03.html)**.

# ¶ 18.04.01    Meets Industrial Applicability

Claim **[1]** the criteria set out in **[PCT Article 33(4)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364085.html)**, and thus **[2]** industrial applicability because the subject matter claimed can be made or used in industry.

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 1, pluralize "claim" if needed, insert claim no.(s), and the verb --meet-- or -- meets--, as appropriate.

2. In bracket 2, insert --have-- or --has--, as appropriate.

4. If the claims have industrial applicability but lack novelty and inventive step, use this form paragraph and additionally use form paragraph **[18.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//fp18.01.html)**.

5. If the claims have industrial applicability and novelty but lack inventive step, use this form paragraph and additionally use one or more of form paragraphs **[18.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//fp18.02.html)**, **[18.02.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//fp18.02.01.html)** and **[18.02.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//fp18.02.02.html)**, as appropriate.

6. If the claims do not have industrial applicability, use form paragraph **[18.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//fp18.03.html)** instead of this form paragraph.

If, on the other hand, it is the opinion of the examiner that some or all claims lack novelty, inventive step, or industrial applicability, specific reasons must be given similar to those used in U.S. national applications.

Form paragraphs **[18.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//fp18.01.html)**, **[18.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//fp18.02.html)**, **[18.02.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//fp18.02.01.html)**, **[18.02.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//fp18.02.02.html)**, and **[18.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//fp18.03.html)** may be used, as appropriate, to explain the negative statements listed in Box No. V.

# ¶ 18.01    Lacks Novelty

Claim **[1]** novelty under **[PCT Article 33(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364085.html)**  as being anticipated by **[2]**.

Examiners are encouraged to indicate any amendments which applicant could present which would avoid a negative statement in the international preliminary examination report in the event that applicant chooses to file a demand.

## VI.    **BOX NO. VI. — CERTAIN DOCUMENTS CITED**

Since all documents cited at the time of establishment of the written opinion will be listed on the simultaneously established search report, there is no need to also list them on the written opinion, and as such this box should be left blank.

## VII.    **BOX NO. VII. — CERTAIN DEFECTS IN THE INTERNATIONAL APPLICATION**

In Box No. VII of Form PCT/ISA/237, defects in the form and content of the international application are identified.

Defects that would be listed in Box No. VII include informalities such as misplaced and/or omitted drawing numerals, misspelled words, and grammatical errors.

The following form paragraphs are used in Box No. VII of PCT/ISA/237, "Certain defects in the international application," for noting technical defects.

# ¶ 18.08    Drawing - Defect in Form or Contents Thereof

The drawings contain the following defect(s) in the form or content thereof: **[1]**

### Examiner Note:

In bracket 1, insert identification of defects in drawings.

# ¶ 18.08.01    Drawing Is Required

The subject matter of this application admits of illustration by drawing to facilitate understanding of the invention. Applicant is required under **[PCT Article 7(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363156.html)**  to furnish a drawing.

# ¶ 18.09    Description - Defect in Form or Contents Thereof

The description contains the following defect(s) in the form or contents thereof: **[1]**

### Examiner Note:

In bracket 1, insert the technical problem, e.g., misspelled word.

# ¶ 18.10    Claims - Defect in Form or Contents Thereof

Claim **[1]** contain(s) the following defect(s) in the form or contents thereof: **[2]**

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 1, pluralize "claim" if needed, and insert claim no.(s).

2. In bracket 2, identify the technical deficiency.

## VIII.    **BOX NO. VIII. — CERTAIN OBSERVATIONS ON THE INTERNATIONAL APPLICATION**

In Box No. VIII, the examiner notifies the applicant of observations made as to the clarity of the claims, the description, the drawings, or on the question whether the claims are fully supported by the description.

If the claims, the description, or the drawings are so unclear, or the claims are so inadequately supported by the description, that no meaningful opinion can be formed on the question of novelty, inventive step (nonobviousness) or industrial applicability, the applicant is so informed in Box No. III. See **[PCT Article 34(4)(a)(ii)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364117.html)**. Reasons for the examiner’s opinion that the claims, description and drawings, etc., lack clarity must also be provided.

If the above situation is found to exist in certain claims only, the provisions of **[PCT Article 34(4)(a)(ii)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364117.html)**  shall apply to those claims only.

If the lack of clarity of the claims, the description, or the drawings is of such a nature that it is possible to form a meaningful opinion on the claimed subject matter, then it is required that the examiner consider the claims and render a written opinion on novelty, inventive step, and industrial applicability in Box No. V.

Since the claims of an international application are not subject to a rejection on either art or indefiniteness consistent with U.S. practice, observations by the examiner with regard to clarity of the claims, the description and the drawings will be treated in the form of an objection in the written opinion in Box No. VIII.

The following form paragraphs may be used in Box No. VIII, "Certain observations on the international application," of Form PCT/ISA/237 for noting objections which are substantive rather than merely technical in nature.

# ¶ 18.11    Drawing Objections - Lack Clarity

The drawings are objected to under **[PCT Article 7](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363156.html)**  as lacking clarity under **[PCT Article 7](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363156.html)**  because: **[1]**

### Examiner Note:

In bracket 1, insert reasons why the drawings lack clarity, e.g., inaccurate showing.

# ¶ 18.12.01    Claims Objectionable - Inadequate Written Description

Claim **[1]** objected to under **[PCT Article 6](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363146.html)**  because the claim **[2]** not fully supported by the description. The application, as originally filed, did not describe: **[3]**

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 1, pluralize "claim" if needed, insert claim no.(s), and the verb --is-- or --are--, as appropriate.

2. In bracket 2, pluralize "claim" if needed, and insert the verb --is-- or --are--.

3. In bracket 3, identify subject matter not described in the application as filed.

# ¶ 18.13.01    Claims Objectionable - Non-Enabling Disclosure

The description does not disclose the claimed invention in a manner sufficiently clear and complete for the claimed invention to be carried out by a person skilled in the art as required by **[PCT Article 5](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363136.html)**  because: **[3]**

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 1, pluralize "claim" if needed, insert claim no.(s) and the appropriate verb --is-- or --are--.

2. In bracket 2, pluralize "claim" if needed, insert the verb --is-- or --are--.

# ¶ 18.14.01    Claims Objectionable - Lack of Best Mode

Claim **[1]** objected to under **[PCT Article 6](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363146.html)**  because the claim **[2]** not fully supported by the description. The description fails to set forth the best mode contemplated by the applicant for carrying out the claimed invention as required by **[PCT Rule 5.1(a)(v)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e366450.html##d0e366457)**  because: **[3]**.

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 1, pluralize "claim" if needed, insert claim no.(s) and the appropriate verb --is-- or --are--.

2. In bracket 2, pluralize "claim" if needed, and insert the appropriate verb --is-- or --are--.

3. In bracket 3, insert the objection and reasons.

# ¶ 18.15    Claims Objectionable - Indefiniteness

Claim **[1]** objected to under **[PCT Article 6](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363146.html)**  as lacking clarity because claim **[2]** indefinite for the following reason(s): **[3]**

### Examiner Note:

1. In brackets 1 and 2, pluralize "claim" if needed, insert claim no.(s) and the appropriate verb --is-- or --are--.

2. In bracket 3, insert reasons.

## IX.    **AUTHORIZED OFFICER**

Pursuant to **[PCT Rules 43bis.1](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e371120.html##d0e371129)**  and **[70.14](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e375320.html##d0e375603)**, the written opinion of the International Searching Authority must indicate the name of the officer of the International Searching Authority responsible for the written opinion, i.e., the "authorized officer." An "authorized officer" is the person who actually performed the search work and prepared the search report and the written opinion, or another person who was responsible for supervising the search and the establishment of the written opinion. See PCT Administrative Instructions Section **[514](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e283331.html)**. Thus, an examiner need not have signatory authority in order to be named as an authorized officer on the written opinion. However, the "file copy" of the written opinion must be signed by an examiner having at least partial signatory authority.

## X.    **TIME TO REPLY**

If, in response to the written opinion of the International Searching Authority (Form PCT/ISA/237), applicant wishes to file a demand and amendments and/or arguments, the time period for response is 3 months from the mailing of the international search report and the written opinion or before the expiration of 22 months from the priority date, whichever expires later.

# 1845.02    Notification of Transmittal of the International Search Report and the Written Opinion of the International Searching Authority, or the Declaration (Form PCT/ISA/220) [R-07.2022]

The examiner completes the Notification of Transmittal of the International Search Report and the Written Opinion of the International Searching Authority, or the Declaration (Form PCT/ISA/220) upon completion of the International Search Report (Form PCT/ISA/210) or the Declaration of Non-Establishment of the International Search Report (Form PCT/ISA/203) and completion of the Written Opinion of the International Searching Authority (Form PCT/ISA/237).

The Form PCT/ISA/220 serves as a cover letter for the PCT/ISA/210 or PCT/ISA/203 and for the PCT/ISA/237.

The Form PCT/ISA/220 indicates the mailing date, which is important for the computation of the time limit for filing amendments to the claims under **[PCT Article 19](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363565.html)**  (see **[MPEP § 1853](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e181649.html)**) and proposed modifications of, or comments on, the abstract. The mailing date on Form PCT/ISA/220 may also establish the time limit for making a demand under **[PCT Rule 54bis.1](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e373594.html##d0e373603)**  (see **[MPEP § 1842](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e171994.html)**, subsection VI) and for making **[Article 34](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364117.html)**  amendments that will be ensured consideration by the examiner (see **[MPEP § 1871](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e184604.html)**).

## I.    **ADDRESS FOR CORRESPONDENCE**

The address for correspondence is taken from the request (Form PCT/RO/101). When an agent represents the applicant, the address for correspondence is listed in Box No. IV of the PCT Request form. For applicants processing their own applications, the address for correspondence may be listed in Box No. II of the Request form. However, where a Notification of the Recording of a Change (Form PCT/IB/306) shows any changes in the applicant or address for correspondence effected under **[PCT Rule 92bis](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e378036.html)**, the later address is used.

## II.    **APPLICANT**

When there is more than one applicant in respect of the international application, only the first mentioned of these on the Request form is indicated in the international search report. Other applicants, if any, are indicated by the words "et al" following the first applicant’s name. The first mentioned applicant is indicated in Box No. II of the Request form, a second applicant is listed in Box No. III; further applicants are listed on the continuation sheet if there are more than two applicants. Company names are preferably written in capital letters; for personal names the family name is preferably given first in capital letters and the given names are in mixed case. This helps to identify the family name.

## I.    **REQUIREMENTS FOR SEQUENCE LISTINGS UNDER WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OFFICE STANDARD ST.26 (WIPO STANDARD ST.26)**

[Editor Note: This subsection is applicable to all international applications, including national phase applications, having an international filing date on or after July 1, 2022, that disclose one or more nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences as defined in WIPO Standard ST.26.]

Patent applications that disclose a nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence(s) by enumeration of its residues, as defined in WIPO Standard ST.26, must present each sequence and associated sequence data in a standardized electronic eXtensible Markup Language (XML) format as a separate part of the specification. This standardized format is set forth in WIPO Standard ST.26, and applies to sequence listings in international applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) and in national and regional applications filed in the intellectual property offices (IPOs) of WIPO member states. As a result, a single sequence listing in compliance with WIPO Standard ST.26 can be prepared for use in all IPOs of WIPO member states.

The sequence listing part of the description must be an electronic file in WIPO Standard ST.26 XML format. Where sequences are included in a sequence listing, they are not required to also appear in the main part of the description. In the description, claims or drawings of the application, the sequences included in the sequence listing shall be referred to by the sequence identifier preceded by "SEQ ID NO:", even if the sequence is also embedded in the description, claims or drawings.

Where an international application, filed under the PCT, contains a disclosure of nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences that are required to be listed within a sequence listing, **[PCT Rule 5.2](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e366450.html##d0e366501)**  requires that the description shall include a sequence listing part of the description complying with the standard provided for in the Administrative Instructions. In accordance with Section **[208](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e279429.html)**, any sequence listing, whether forming part of the international application or not forming part of the international application, shall comply with **[Annex C](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e285466.html##aai_it_35ef5_20add_3db)**  of the Administrative Instructions. Where applicant has not provided a sequence listing in accordance with **[Annex C](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e285466.html##aai_it_35ef5_20add_3db)**  of the Administrative Instructions and the USPTO acts as International Searching Authority (ISA) or International Preliminary Examining Authority (IPEA), the ISA/IPEA may invite applicant to furnish a sequence listing, with a late furnishing fee, under **[PCT Rule 13ter](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e367886.html)** . This invitation will specify a time limit for a proper response. A proper response to such an invitation would include, the submission of a sequence listing in accordance with **[Annex C](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e285466.html##aai_it_35ef5_20add_3db)**  of the Administrative Instructions, the late furnishing fee specified in **[37 CFR 1.445(a)(5)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e328174.html##ar_it_2bf29_25b37_368)**, and a statement to the effect that the sequence listing does not go beyond the disclosure of the international application as filed. If a sequence listing compliant with WIPO Standard ST.26 has not been furnished to the ISA/IPEA within the time limit set forth in the invitation, the ISA/IPEA will only search / examine the international application to the extent that a meaningful search or examination can be performed without the sequence listing. See **[PCT Rule 13ter.1(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e367886.html##d0e367921)**. Where the application discloses sequences that are required to be within a sequence listing, it is advisable for the applicant to submit a sequence listing compliant with WIPO Standard ST.26 XML format together with the international application on the international filing date rather than to wait for an invitation by the International Searching Authority or International Preliminary Examining Authority.

For a detailed discussion of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Standard ST.26, see **[MPEP § 2412](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//ch2400_d22348_25ede_3e6.html)** - **[2419](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//ch2400_d35dcb_1e61f_10b.html)**, in particular **[MPEP § 2414.05](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//ch2400_d35e1f_25c72_2b6.html)**.

## II.    **REQUIREMENTS FOR SEQUENCE LISTINGS UNDER WORLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OFFICE STANDARD ST.25 (WIPO ST.25)**

[Editor Note: This subsection is only applicable to international applications, including national phase applications, having an international filing date before July 1, 2022, that disclose one or more nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences as defined in WIPO Standard ST.25.]

Where an international application contains disclosure of a nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence, the description must contain a listing of the sequence complying with the standard specified in **[Annex C](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e285466.html##aai_it_35ef5_20add_3db)**  of the Administrative Instructions. A copy of the Administrative Instructions in force before July 1, 2022 can be found at: **[www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text/584509](https://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text/584509)**. See **[MPEP § 1823.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e169024.html)**, subsection II. If the International Searching Authority finds that an international application contains nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences in the disclosure, but finds that the description does not contain a sequence listing or that the sequence listing provided in the international application does not comply with the PCT Administrative Instructions **[Annex C](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e285466.html##aai_it_35ef5_20add_3db)**, the International Searching Authority may invite the applicant to furnish a listing that complies with the standard and pay a late furnishing fee.

An invitation from the International Searching Authority to furnish a sequence listing that complies with the standard specified in the Administrative Instructions and pay a late furnishing fee will specify a time limit for complying with the invitation. Any sequence listing furnished by the applicant in response to the invitation must be accompanied by a statement to the effect that the listing does not include matter which goes beyond the disclosure in the international application as filed and must be submitted to the International Searching Authority. If the applicant does not furnish the required sequence listing and pay any required late furnishing fee within the time limit specified in the invitation, the search undertaken by the International Searching Authority may be limited. See **[MPEP § 1823.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e169024.html)**, subsection II.

Any sequence listing provided after the international filing date and in response to the invitation to furnish a sequence listing by the International Searching Authority, is not considered part of the international application. If the applicant wishes to include such a listing as part of the international application, appropriate amendments to the description may be made later under **[PCT Article 34](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364117.html)**, provided that the applicant files a Demand for international preliminary examination and does not go beyond the disclosure in the international application as filed.

## I.    **THE REQUIREMENT FOR "UNITY OF INVENTION"**

Any international application must relate to one invention only or to a group of inventions so linked as to form a single general inventive concept (**[PCT Article 3(4)(iii)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363046.html)**  and **[17(3)(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363501.html)**, **[PCT Rule 13.1](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e367565.html##d0e367572)**, and **[37 CFR 1.475](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e328679.html)** ). Observance of this requirement is checked by the International Searching Authority and may be relevant in the national (or regional) phase.

The decision in _Caterpillar Tractor Co. v. Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks,_ 650 F. Supp. 218, 231 USPQ 590 (E.D. Va. 1986) held that the Patent and Trademark Office interpretation of **[37 CFR 1.141(b)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e324081.html)**  as applied to unity of invention determinations in international applications was not in accordance with the Patent Cooperation Treaty and its implementing regulations. In the Caterpillar international application, the USPTO acting as an International Searching Authority, had held lack of unity of invention between a set of claims directed to a process for forming a sprocket and a set of claims drawn to an apparatus (die) for forging a sprocket. The court stated that it was an unreasonable interpretation to say that the expression "specifically designed" as found in former PCT Rule 13.2(ii) means that the process and apparatus have unity of invention if they can only be used with each other, as was set forth in **[MPEP § 806.05(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e104686.html)**.

Therefore, when the Office considers international applications as an International Searching Authority, as an International Preliminary Examining Authority, and during the national stage as a Designated or Elected Office under **[35 U.S.C. 371](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e307164.html)**, **[PCT Rule 13.1](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e367565.html##d0e367572)**  and **[13.2](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e367565.html##d0e367582)**  will be followed when considering unity of invention of claims of different categories without regard to the practice in national applications filed under **[35 U.S.C. 111](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e302673.html)**. No change was made in restriction practice in United States national applications filed under **[35 U.S.C. 111](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e302673.html)**  outside the PCT.

In applying **[PCT Rule 13.2](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e367565.html##d0e367582)**  to international applications as an International Searching Authority, an International Preliminary Examining Authority and to national stage applications under **[35 U.S.C. 371](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e307164.html)**, examiners should consider for unity of invention all the claims to different categories of invention in the application and permit retention in the same application for searching and/or preliminary examination, claims to the categories which meet the requirements of **[PCT Rule 13.2](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e367565.html##d0e367582)**.

**[PCT Rule 13.2](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e367565.html##d0e367582)**, as it was modified effective July 1, 1992, no longer specifies the combinations of categories of invention which are considered to have unity of invention. Those categories, which now appear as a part of Chapter 10 of the International Search and Preliminary Examination Guidelines, may be obtained from the Patent Examiner’s Toolkit link or from WIPO’s website (**[www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts/gdlines.html](http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts/gdlines.html)** ). The categories of invention in former PCT Rule 13.2 have been replaced with a statement describing the method for determining whether the requirement of unity of invention is satisfied. Unity of invention exists only when there is a technical relationship among the claimed inventions involving one or more special technical features. The term "special technical features" is defined as meaning those technical features that define a contribution which each of the inventions considered as a whole, makes over the prior art. The determination is made based on the contents of the claims as interpreted in light of the description and drawings. Chapter 10 of the International Search and Preliminary Examination Guidelines also contains examples concerning unity of invention.

## II.    **DETERMINATION OF "UNITY OF INVENTION"**

An international application should relate to only one invention or, if there is more than one invention, the inclusion of those inventions in one international application is only permitted if all inventions are so linked as to form a single general inventive concept (**[PCT Rule 13.1](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e367565.html##d0e367572)** ). With respect to a group of inventions claimed in an international application, unity of invention exists only when there is a technical relationship among the claimed inventions involving one or more of the same or corresponding special technical features. The expression "special technical features" is defined in **[PCT Rule 13.2](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e367565.html##d0e367582)**  as meaning those technical features that define a contribution which each of the inventions, considered as a whole, makes over the prior art. The determination is made on the contents of the claims as interpreted in light of the description and drawings (if any).

Whether or not any particular technical feature makes a "contribution" over the prior art, and therefore constitutes a "special technical feature," should be considered with respect to novelty and inventive step. For example, a document discovered in the international search shows that there is a presumption of lack of novelty or inventive step in a main claim, so that there may be no technical relationship left over the prior art among the claimed inventions involving one or more of the same or corresponding special technical features, leaving two or more dependent claims without a single general inventive concept.

Lack of unity of invention may be directly evident "_a priori,_" i.e., before considering the claims in relation to any prior art, or may only become apparent "_a posteriori,_" i.e., after taking the prior art into consideration. For example, independent claims to A + X, A + Y, X + Y can be said to lack unity _a priori_ as there is no subject matter common to all claims. In the case of independent claims to A + X and A + Y, unity of invention is present _a priori_ as A is common to both claims. However, if it can be established that A is known, there is lack of unity _a posteriori,_ since A (be it a single feature or a group of features) is not a technical feature that defines a contribution over the prior art.

Although lack of unity of invention should certainly be raised in clear cases, it should neither be raised nor maintained on the basis of a narrow, literal or academic approach. There should be a broad, practical consideration of the degree of interdependence of the alternatives presented, in relation to the state of the art as revealed by the international search or, in accordance with **[PCT Article 33(6)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364085.html)**, by any additional document considered to be relevant. If the common matter of the independent claims is well known and the remaining subject matter of each claim differs from that of the others without there being any unifying novel inventive concept common to all, then clearly there is lack of unity of invention. If, on the other hand, there is a single general inventive concept that appears novel and involves inventive step, then there is unity of invention and an objection of lack of unity does not arise. For determining the action to be taken by the examiner between these two extremes, rigid rules cannot be given and each case should be considered on its merits, the benefit of any doubt being given to the applicant.

From the preceding paragraphs it is clear that the decision with respect to unity of invention rests with the International Searching Authority or the International Preliminary Examining Authority. However, the International Searching Authority or the International Preliminary Examining Authority should not raise objection of lack of unity of invention merely because the inventions claimed are classified in separate classification groups or merely for the purpose of restricting the international search to certain classification groups.

Unity of invention has to be considered in the first place only in relation to the independent claims in an international application and not the dependent claims. By "dependent" claim is meant a claim which contains all the features of one or more other claims and contains a reference, preferably at the beginning, to the other claim or claims and then states the additional features claimed (**[PCT Rule 6.4](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e366517.html##d0e366588)** ). The examiner should bear in mind that a claim may also contain a reference to another claim even if it is not a dependent claim as defined in **[PCT Rule 6.4](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e366517.html##d0e366588)**. One example of this is a claim referring to a claim of a different category (for example, "Apparatus for carrying out the process of Claim 1 ...," or "Process for the manufacture of the product of Claim 1 ..."). Similarly, a claim to one part referring to another cooperating part, for example, "plug for cooperation with the socket of Claim 1 ...") is not a dependent claim.

If the independent claims avoid the prior art and satisfy the requirement of unity of invention, no problem of lack of unity arises in respect of any claims that depend on the independent claims. In particular, it does not matter if a dependent claim itself contains a further invention. For example, suppose claim 1 claims a turbine rotor blade shaped in a specified manner such that it avoids the prior art, while claim 2 is for a "turbine rotor blade as claimed in claim 1" and produced from alloy Z. Then no objection under **[PCT Rule 13](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e367565.html)**  arises either because alloy Z was new and its composition was not obvious and thus the alloy itself already contains the essential features of an independent possibly later patentable invention, or because, although alloy Z was not new, its application in respect of turbine rotor blades was not obvious, and thus represents an independent invention in conjunction with turbine rotor blades. As another example, suppose that the main claim defines a process avoiding the prior art for the preparation of a product A starting from a product B and the second claim reads: "Process according to claim 1 characterized by producing B by a reaction using the product C." In this case, too, no objection arises under **[PCT Rule 13](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e367565.html)**, whether or not the process for preparation of B from C is novel and inventive, since claim 2 contains all the features of claim 1. Equally, no problem arises in the case of a genus/species situation where the genus claim avoids the prior art, provided the genus claim is directed only to alternatives of a similar nature and the species falls entirely within the genus. To determine if a genus claim is directed only to alternatives "of a similar nature," see subsection III.B. below. Moreover, no problem arises in the case of a combination/subcombination situation where the subcombination claim avoids the prior art and the combination claim includes all the features of the subcombination.

If, however, an independent claim does not avoid the prior art, then the question whether there is still an inventive link between all the claims dependent on that claim needs to be carefully considered. If there is no link remaining, an objection of lack of unity _a posteriori_ (that is, arising only after assessment of the prior art) may be raised. Similar considerations apply in the case of a genus/species or combination/subcombination situation.

This method for determining whether unity of invention exists is intended to be applied even before the commencement of the international search. Where a search of the prior art is made, an initial determination of unity of invention, based on the assumption that the claims avoid the prior art, may be reconsidered on the basis of the results of the search of the prior art.

Alternative forms of an invention may be claimed either in a plurality of independent claims, or in a single claim. In the latter case, the presence of the independent alternatives may not be immediately apparent. In either case, however, the same criteria should be applied in deciding whether there is unity of invention. Accordingly, lack of unity of invention may exist within a single claim. Where the claim contains distinct embodiments that are not linked by a single general inventive concept, the objection as to lack of unity of invention should be raised. **[PCT Rule 13.3](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e367565.html##d0e367595)**  does not prevent an Authority from objecting to alternatives being contained within a single claim on the basis of considerations such as clarity, the conciseness of claims or the claims fee system applicable in that Authority.

Objection of lack of unity of invention does not normally arise if the combination of a number of individual elements is claimed in a single claim (as opposed to distinct embodiments as discussed in the paragraph immediately above), even if these elements seem unrelated when considered individually.

## III.    **ILLUSTRATIONS OF PARTICULAR SITUATIONS**

There are three particular situations for which the method for determining unity of invention contained in **[PCT Rule 13.2](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e367565.html##d0e367582)**  is explained in greater detail:

- (A) Combinations of different categories of claims;
- (B) So-called "Markush practice"; and
- (C) Intermediate and final products.

Principles for the interpretation of the method contained in **[PCT Rule 13.2](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e367565.html##d0e367582)**, in the context of each of those situations are set out below. It is understood that the principles set out below are, in all instances, interpretations of and not exceptions to the requirements of **[PCT Rule 13.2](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e367565.html##d0e367582)**.

Examples to assist in understanding the interpretation on the three areas of special concern referred to in the preceding paragraph are set out in Chapter 10 of the International Search and Preliminary Examination Guidelines which can be obtained from the Patent Examiner’s Toolkit link or from WIPO’s website (**[www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts/gdlines.html](http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts/gdlines.html)** ).

## A.    **_Combinations of Different Categories of Claims_**

The method for determining unity of invention under **[PCT Rule 13](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e367565.html)**  shall be construed as permitting, in particular, the inclusion of any one of the following combinations of claims of different categories in the same international application:

- (A) In addition to an independent claim for a given product, an independent claim for a process specially adapted for the manufacture of the said product, and an independent claim for a use of the said product; or
- (B) In addition to an independent claim for a given process, an independent claim for an apparatus or means specifically designed for carrying out the said process; or
- (C) In addition to an independent claim for a given product, an independent claim for a process specially adapted for the manufacture of the said product and an independent claim for an apparatus or means specifically designed for carrying out the said process.

A process is specially adapted for the manufacture of a product if it inherently results in the product and an apparatus or means is specifically designed for carrying out a process if the contribution over the prior art of the apparatus or means corresponds to the contribution the process makes over the prior art.

Thus, a process shall be considered to be specially adapted for the manufacture of a product if the claimed process inherently results in the claimed product with the technical relationship being present between the claimed product and claimed process. The words "specially adapted" are not intended to imply that the product could not also be manufactured by a different process.

Also an apparatus or means shall be considered to be specifically designed for carrying out a claimed process if the contribution over the prior art of the apparatus or means corresponds to the contribution the process makes over the prior art. Consequently, it would not be sufficient that the apparatus or means is merely capable of being used in carrying out the claimed process. However, the expression "specifically designed" does not imply that the apparatus or means could not be used for carrying out another process, nor that the process could not be carried out using an alternative apparatus or means.

More extensive combinations than those set forth above should be looked at carefully to ensure that the requirements of both **[PCT Rule 13](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e367565.html)**  (unity of invention) and **[PCT Article 6](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363146.html)**  (conciseness of claims) are satisfied. In particular, while a single set of independent claims according to one of (A), (B), or (C) above is always permissible, it does not require the International Authority to accept a plurality of such sets which could arise by combining the provisions of **[PCT Rule 13.3](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e367565.html##d0e367595)**  (which provides that the determination of unity of invention be made without regard to whether the inventions are claimed in separate claims or as alternatives within a single claim), with the provisions set out above (thus resulting in a set based on each of a number of independent claims in the same category under **[PCT Rule 13.3](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e367565.html##d0e367595)** ). The proliferation of claims arising from a combined effect of this kind should be accepted only exceptionally. For example, independent claims are permissible for two related articles such as a transmitter and receiver; however, it does not follow that an applicant may include also, in the one international application, four additional independent claims: two for a process for the manufacture of the transmitter and the receiver, respectively, and two for use of the transmitter and receiver, respectively.

A single general inventive concept must link the claims in the various categories and in this connection the wording above should be carefully noted. The link between product and process in (A) is that the process must be "specially adapted for the manufacture of" the product. Similarly, in (B), the apparatus or means claimed must be "specifically designed for" carrying out the process. Likewise, in (C), the process must be "specially adapted for the manufacture of" the product and the apparatus must be "specifically designed for" carrying out the process. In combinations (A) and (C), the emphasis is on, and the essence of the invention should primarily reside in, the product, whereas in combination (B) the emphasis is on, and the invention should primarily reside in, the process. (See Examples in Chapter 10 of the International Search and Preliminary Examination Guidelines which can be obtained from the Patent Examiner’s Toolkit link or from WIPO’s website (**[www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts/gdlines.html](http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts/gdlines.html)**.))

## B.    **_"Markush Practice"_**

The situation involving the so-called Markush practice wherein a single claim defines alternatives (chemical or non-chemical) is also governed by **[PCT Rule 13.2](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e367565.html##d0e367582)**. In this special situation, the requirement of a technical interrelationship and the same or corresponding special technical features as defined in **[PCT Rule 13.2](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e367565.html##d0e367582)**, shall be considered to be met when the alternatives are of a similar nature.

When the Markush grouping is for alternatives of chemical compounds, they shall be regarded as being of a similar nature where the following criteria are fulfilled:

- (A) All alternatives have a common property or activity; and
- (B)
    - (1) A common structure is present, i.e., a significant structural element is shared by all of the alternatives; or
- (B)
    - (2) In cases where the common structure cannot be the unifying criteria, all alternatives belong to a recognized class of chemical compounds in the art to which the invention pertains.

In paragraph (B)(1), above, the words "significant structural element is shared by all of the alternatives" refer to cases where the compounds share a common chemical structure which occupies a large portion of their structures, or in case the compounds have in common only a small portion of their structures, the commonly shared structure constitutes a structurally distinctive portion in view of existing prior art, and the common structure is essential to the common property or activity. The structural element may be a single component or a combination of individual components linked together.

In paragraph (B)(2), above, the words "recognized class of chemical compounds" mean that there is an expectation from the knowledge in the art that members of the class will behave in the same way in the context of the claimed invention. In other words, each member could be substituted one for the other, with the expectation that the same intended result would be achieved.

The fact that the alternatives of a Markush grouping can be differently classified should not, taken alone, be considered to be justification for a finding of a lack of unity of invention.

When dealing with alternatives, if it can be shown that at least one Markush alternative is not novel over the prior art, the question of unity of invention should be reconsidered by the examiner. Reconsideration does not necessarily imply that an objection of lack of unity shall be raised. (See Examples in Chapter 10 of the International Search and Preliminary Examination Guidelines which can be obtained from the Patent Examiner’s Toolkit link or from WIPO’s website (**[www.wipo.int/pct/ en/texts/gdlines.html](http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts/gdlines.html)**.))

## C.    **_Intermediate and Final Products_**

The situation involving intermediate and final products is also governed by **[PCT Rule 13.2](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e367565.html##d0e367582)**.

The term "intermediate" is intended to mean intermediate or starting products. Such products have the ability to be used to produce final products through a physical or chemical change in which the intermediate loses its identity.

Unity of invention shall be considered to be present in the context of intermediate and final products where the following two conditions are fulfilled:

- (A) The intermediate and final products have the same essential structural element, in that:
    - (1) The basic chemical structures of the intermediate and the final products are the same, or
    - (2) The chemical structures of the two products are technically closely interrelated, the intermediate incorporating an essential structural element into the final product; and
- (B) The intermediate and final products are technically interrelated, this meaning that the final product is manufactured directly from the intermediate or is separated from it by a small number of intermediates all containing the same essential structural element.

Unity of invention may also be considered to be present between intermediate and final products of which the structures are not known, for example, as between an intermediate having a known structure and a final product the structure of which is not known, or as between an intermediate of unknown structure and a final product of unknown structure. In order to satisfy unity in such cases, there must be sufficient evidence to lead one to conclude that the intermediate and final products are technically closely interrelated as, for example, when the intermediate contains the same essential element as the final product or incorporates an essential element into the final product.

It is possible to accept in a single international application different intermediate products used in different processes for the preparation of the final product, provided that they have the same essential structural element.

The intermediate and final products shall not be separated, in the process leading from one to the other, by an intermediate which is not new.

If the same international application claims different intermediates for different structural parts of the final product, unity shall not be regarded as being present between the intermediates.

If the intermediate and final products are families of compounds, each intermediate compound shall correspond to a compound claimed in the family of the final products. However, some of the final products may have no corresponding compound in the family of the intermediate products so that the two families need not be absolutely congruent.

As long as unity of invention can be recognized applying the above interpretations, the fact that, besides the ability to be used to produce final products, the intermediates also exhibit other possible effects or activities shall not affect the decision on unity of invention. (See Examples in Chapter 10 of the International Search and Preliminary Examination Guidelines which can be obtained from the Patent Examiner’s Toolkit link or from WIPO’s website (**[www.wipo.int/pct/en/ texts/gdlines.html](http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts/gdlines.html)**.))

## IV.    **SEARCH OF ADDITIONAL INVENTIONS WITHOUT PAYMENT OF FEES**

If little or no additional search effort is required, reasons of economy _may_ make it advisable for the examiner, while making the search for the main invention, to search at the same time, despite the nonpayment of additional fees, one or more additional inventions in the classification units consulted for the main invention. The international search for such additional inventions will then have to be completed in any further classification units which may be relevant, when the additional search fees have been paid. This situation may occur when the lack of unity of invention is found either " _a priori_ " or " _a posteriori_."

When the examiner finds lack of unity of invention, normally, the applicant is invited to pay fees for the search of additional inventions. In exceptional circumstances, however, the examiner may be able to establish both an international search and a written opinion covering more than one invention with negligible additional work, in particular, when the inventions are conceptually very close. In those cases, the examiner may decide to complete the international search and the written opinion of the International Searching Authority for the additional invention(s) together with that for the invention first mentioned. In considering the amount of work involved, the examiner should take into account the time needed to create the written opinion as well as that needed to perform the search, since even when the additional work with regard to the search is negligible, the opposite may be the case for the written opinion of the International Searching Authority and therefore justify requesting the additional fees. If it is considered that the total additional work does not justify requesting additional fees, all results are included in the international search report (and where applicable, the written opinion) without inviting the applicant to pay an additional search fee in respect of the additional inventions searched but stating the finding of lack of unity of invention.

## V.    **INVITATION TO PAY ADDITIONAL FEES**

The search fee which the applicant is required to pay is intended to compensate the International Searching Authority for carrying out an international search and preparing a written opinion, but only where the international application meets the "requirement of unity of invention." That means that the international application must relate to only one invention or must relate to a group of inventions which are so linked as to form a single general inventive concept (**[PCT Articles 3(4)(iii)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363046.html)**  and **[17(3)(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363501.html)** ).

If the International Searching Authority finds that the international application does not comply with the requirement of unity of invention, the applicant will be informed of the lack of unity of invention by a communication preceding the issuance of the international search report and written opinion of the International Searching Authority which contains an invitation to pay additional search fees. (Form PCT/ISA/206 or USPTO/299 (telephone practice), see below). This invitation specifies the reasons the international application is not considered to comply with the requirement of unity of invention, identifies the separate inventions, and indicates the number of additional search fees and the amount to be paid (**[PCT Rules 40.1](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e370760.html##d0e370767)**, **[40.2(a) and (b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e370760.html##d0e370797)** ). The International Searching Authority cannot consider the application withdrawn for lack of unity of invention, nor invite the applicant to amend the claims, but informs the applicant that, if the international search report is to be drawn up in respect of those inventions present other than the first mentioned, then the additional fees must be paid within one month from the date of the invitation to pay additional fees (**[PCT Rule 40.1](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e370760.html##d0e370767)** ). Such additional fees are payable directly to the International Searching Authority which is conducting the search, i.e., the USPTO, EPO, KIPO, IPAU, ILPO, JPO, or IPOS. The additional search fee amounts for the competent international searching authorities can be found in Annex D of the Applicant’s Guide (**[www.wipo.int/pct/en/appguide](http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/appguide)** ).

In the invitation to pay additional fees, the International Searching Authority should set out a logically presented, technical reasoning containing the basic considerations behind the finding of lack of unity (**[PCT Rule 40.1](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e370760.html##d0e370767)** ).

Since these payments must take place within the time limit set by the International Searching Authority so as to enable the observation of the time limit for establishing the international search report set by **[PCT Rule 42](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e370881.html)**, the International Searching Authority should endeavor to ensure that international searches be made as early as possible after the receipt of the search copy. The International Searching Authority finally draws up the international search report and written opinion of the International Searching Authority on those parts of the international application which relate to the "main invention," that is, the invention or the group of inventions so linked as to form a single general inventive concept first mentioned in the claims (**[PCT Article 17(3)(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363501.html)** ). Moreover, the international search report and written opinion of the International Searching Authority will be established also on those parts of the international application which relate to any invention (or any group of inventions so linked as to form a single general inventive concept) in respect of which the applicant has paid any additional fee within the prescribed time limits.

Where, within the prescribed time limit, the applicant does not pay any additional fees or only pays some of the additional fees indicated, certain parts of the international application will consequently not be searched. The lack of an international search report in respect of such parts of the international application will, in itself, have no influence on the validity of the international application and processing of the international application will continue, both in the international and in the national (regional) phases. The unsearched claims, upon entry into the national stage, will be considered by the examiner and may be the subject of a holding of lack of unity of invention.

## VI.    **PREPARATION OF THE INVITATION TO PAY ADDITIONAL FEES**

An Invitation to Pay Additional Fees and, Where Applicable, Protest Fee (Form PCT/ISA/206) is used to invite the applicant to pay additional search fees. In the space provided on form PCT/ISA/206, the examiner should indicate the number of inventions claimed in the international application covering which particular claims and explain why the international application is not considered to comply with the requirements of unity of invention. The examiner should then indicate the total amount of additional fees required for the search of all claimed inventions.

Any claims found to be unsearchable under **[PCT Article 17(2)(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363501.html)**  are not included with any invention. Unsearchable claims include the following:

- (A) claims drawn to subject matter not required to be searched by the International Searching Authority (see **[MPEP § 1843.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e172603.html)**);
- (B) claims in respect of which a meaningful search cannot be carried out (see **[MPEP § 1843.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e172803.html)**);
- (C) multiple dependent claims which do not comply with **[PCT Rule 6.4(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e366517.html##d0e366588)**  (see **[MPEP § 1843.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e172803.html)**).

In the box provided at the top of the form, the time limit of one month for response is set according to **[PCT Rule 40.1](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e370760.html##d0e370767)**. Extensions of time are not permitted.

## VII.    **AUTHORIZED OFFICER**

Form PCT/ISA/206 must be signed by an examiner with at least partial signatory authority.

## VIII.    **TELEPHONIC UNITY PRACTICE**

Telephone practice may be used to allow applicants to pay additional fees if

- (A) Applicant or applicant’s legal representative has a USPTO deposit account,
- (B) Applicant or the legal representative orally agrees to charge the additional fees to the account, and
- (C) A complete record of the telephone conversation is included with the international search report including:
    - (1) Examiner’s name;
    - (2) Authorizing attorney’s name;
    - (3) Date of conversation;
    - (4) Inventions for which additional fees paid; and
    - (5) Deposit account number and amount to be charged.

When the telephone practice is used in making lack of unity requirements, it is critical that the examiner orally inform applicant that there is no right to protest the holding of lack of unity of invention for any group of invention(s) for which no additional search fee has been paid.

The examiner must further orally advise applicant that any protest to the holding of lack of unity or the amount of additional fee required must be filed in writing no later than one month from the mailing date of the international search report. The examiner should fill in the information on Form USPTO/299 "Chapter I PCT Telephone Memorandum for Lack of Unity" as a record of the telephonic holding of lack of unity.

If the applicant or the legal representative or agent refuses to either agree to a search limited to the first mentioned invention or authorize payment of additional fees over the telephone, or if applicant does not have a deposit account, the examiner should send a written invitation using Form PCT/ISA/206.

If a written invitation is required, the examiner should, if possible, submit the written invitation to the Technology Center for review and mailing within 7 days from the date the international application is charged to the examiner.

## IX.    **FORM PARAGRAPHS FOR LACK OF UNITY IN INTERNATIONAL APPLICATIONS**

# ¶ 18.05    Heading for Lack of Unity Action for PCT Applications During the International Phase (Including Species)

## REQUIREMENT FOR UNITY OF INVENTION

As provided in **[37 CFR 1.475(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e328679.html##d0e328687)**, an international application shall relate to one invention only or to a group of inventions so linked as to form a single general inventive concept ("requirement of unity of invention"). Where a group of inventions is claimed in an international application, the requirement of unity of invention shall be fulfilled only when there is a technical relationship among those inventions involving one or more of the same or corresponding special technical features. The expression "special technical features" shall mean those technical features that define a contribution which each of the claimed inventions, considered as a whole, makes over the prior art.

The determination whether a group of inventions is so linked as to form a single general inventive concept shall be made without regard to whether the inventions are claimed in separate claims or as alternatives within a single claim. See **[37 CFR 1.475(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e328679.html##d0e328729)**.

## When Claims Are Directed to Multiple Processes, Products, and/or Apparatuses:

Products, processes of manufacture, processes of use, and apparatuses are different categories of invention. When an application includes claims to more than one product, process, or apparatus, the first invention of the category first mentioned in the claims of the application and the first recited invention of each of the other categories related thereto will be considered as the "main invention" in the claims. In the case of non-compliance with unity of invention and where no additional fees are timely paid, the international search and/or international preliminary examination, as appropriate, will be based on the main invention in the claims. See **[PCT Article 17(3)(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363501.html##d0e363534)**, **[37 CFR 1.475(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e328679.html##d0e328719)**, **[37 CFR 1.476(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e328736.html##d0e328767)**  and **[37 CFR 1.488(b)(3)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e329059.html##d0e329086)**.

As provided in **[37 CFR 1.475(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e328679.html##d0e328691)**, an international application containing claims to different categories of invention will be considered to have unity of invention if the claims are drawn only to one of the following combinations of categories:

- (1) A product and a process specially adapted for the manufacture of said product; or
- (2) A product and a process of use of said product; or
- (3) A product, a process specially adapted for the manufacture of the said product, and a use of the said product; or
- (4) A process and an apparatus or means specifically designed for carrying out the said process; or
- (5) A product, a process specially adapted for the manufacture of the said product, and an apparatus or means specifically designed for carrying out the said process.

Otherwise, unity of invention might not be present. See **[37 CFR 1.475(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e328679.html##d0e328715)**.

This application contains the following inventions or groups of inventions which are not so linked as to form a single general inventive concept under **[PCT Rule 13.1](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e367565.html##d0e367572)**.

# ¶ 18.07    Lack of Unity - Reasons Why Inventions Lack Unity

The groups of inventions listed above do not relate to a single general inventive concept under **[PCT Rule 13.1](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e367565.html##d0e367572)**  because, under **[PCT Rule 13.2](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e367565.html##d0e367582)**, they lack the same or corresponding special technical features for the following reasons:

### Examiner Note:

Follow with form paragraphs **[18.07.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//fp18.07.01.html)** through **[18.07.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//fp18.07.03.html)**, as appropriate.

# ¶ 18.07.01    Same or Corresponding Technical Feature Lacking Among Groups

**[1]** lack unity of invention because the groups do not share the same or corresponding technical feature.

### Examiner Note:

1. This form paragraph may be used, for example, where the claims of Group I are directed to A + B, whereas the claims of Group II are directed to C + D, and thus the groups do not share a technical feature.

2. In bracket 1: For **international applications in the international phase**, identify the groups involved by Roman numerals (e.g., "Groups I and II") in accordance with the groups listed using form paragraphs **[18.06](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//fp18.06.html)** - **[18.06.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//fp18.06.02.html)**.

# ¶ 18.07.02    Shared Technical Feature Does Not Make a Contribution Over the Prior Art

**[1]** lack unity of invention because even though the inventions of these groups require the technical feature of **[2]**, this technical feature is not a special technical feature as it does not make a contribution over the prior art in view of **[3]**. **[4]**

### Examiner Note:

1. In bracket 1: For **international applications in the international phase**, identify the groups involved by Roman numerals (e.g., "Groups I and II") in accordance with the groups listed using form paragraphs 18.06 - 18.06.02. For **U.S. national stage applications under 35 U.S.C. **[371](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e307164.html)****  , identify the groups involved by Roman numerals (e.g., "Groups I and II") where inventions have been grouped using form paragraphs **[18.06](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//fp18.06.html)** - **[18.06.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//fp18.06.02.html)**, or identify the species involved where species have been listed using form paragraph **[18.20](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//fp18.20.html)**.

2. In bracket 2, identify the technical feature shared by the groups.

3. In bracket 3, insert citation of prior art reference(s) demonstrating the shared technical feature does not make a contribution over the prior art. Whether a particular technical feature makes a "contribution" over the prior art, and, therefore, constitutes a "special technical feature," is considered with respect to novelty and inventive step.

4. In bracket 4, explain how the shared technical feature lacks novelty or inventive step in view of the reference(s).

# ¶ 18.07.03    Heading – Chemical Compound Alternatives of Markush Group Are Not of a Similar Nature

Where a single claim defines alternatives of a Markush group, the requirement of a technical interrelationship and the same or corresponding special technical features as defined in Rule 13.2, is considered met when the alternatives are of a similar nature. When the Markush grouping is for alternatives of chemical compounds, the alternatives are regarded as being of a similar nature where the following criteria are fulfilled:

- (A) all alternatives have a common property or activity; AND
- (B)
    - (1) a common structure is present, that is, a significant structural element is shared by all of the alternatives; OR
- (B)
    - (2) in cases where the common structure cannot be the unifying criteria, all alternatives belong to a recognized class of chemical compounds in the art to which the invention pertains.

The phrase "significant structural element is shared by all of the alternatives" refers to cases where the compounds share a common chemical structure which occupies a large portion of their structures, or in case the compounds have in common only a small portion of their structures, the commonly shared structure constitutes a structurally distinctive portion in view of existing prior art, and the common structure is essential to the common property or activity.

The phrase "recognized class of chemical compounds" means that there is an expectation from the knowledge in the art that members of the class will behave in the same way in the context of the claimed invention, i.e. each member could be substituted one for the other, with the expectation that the same intended result would be achieved.

### Examiner Note:

1. This heading should be used when the chemical alternatives of a Markush group are determined to lack unity of invention.

2. Follow with form paragraphs listed using form paragraphs **[18.07.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//fp18.07.03.html)**a - **[18.07.03](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//fp18.07.03.html)**c, as appropriate.

## X.    **PROTEST PROCEDURE**

#### _PCT Administrative Instructions Section 502._

#### _Transmittal of Protest Against Payment of Additional Fees and Decision Thereon Where International Application Is Considered to Lack Unity of Invention_

The International Searching Authority shall transmit to the applicant, preferably at the latest together with the international search report, any decision which it has taken under **[Rule 40.2(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e370760.html##d0e370797)**  on the protest of the applicant against payment of additional fees where the international application is considered to lack unity of invention. At the same time, it shall transmit to the International Bureau a copy of both the protest and the decision thereon, as well as any request by the applicant to forward the texts of both the protest and the decision thereon to the designated Offices.

#### _37 C.F.R. 1.477  Protest to lack of unity of invention before the International Searching Authority._

- (a) If the applicant disagrees with the holding of lack of unity of invention by the International Searching Authority, additional fees may be paid under protest, accompanied by a request for refund and a statement setting forth reasons for disagreement or why the required additional fees are considered excessive, or both (**[PCT Rule 40.2(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e370760.html##d0e370797)** ).
- (b) Protest under paragraph (a) of this section will be examined by the Director or the Director’s designee. In the event that the applicant’s protest is determined to be justified, the additional fees or a portion thereof will be refunded.
- (c) An applicant who desires that a copy of the protest and the decision thereon accompany the international search report when forwarded to the Designated Offices, may notify the International Searching Authority to that effect any time prior to the issuance of the international search report. Thereafter, such notification should be directed to the International Bureau (**[PCT Rule 40.2(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e370760.html##d0e370797)** ).

The applicant may protest the allegation of lack of unity of invention or that the number of required additional fees is excessive and request a refund of the additional fee(s) paid. If, and to the extent that, the International Searching Authority finds the protest justified, the fee(s) are refunded (**[PCT Rule 40.2(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e370760.html##d0e370797)** ). (The additional search fees must be paid for any protest to be considered, but no protest fee under **[PCT Rule 40.2(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e370760.html##d0e370830)**  is due in the ISA/US.)

Protest of allegation of lack of unity is in the form of a reasoned statement accompanying payment of the additional fee, explaining why the applicant believes that the requirements of unity of invention are fulfilled and fully taking into account the reasons indicated in the invitation to pay additional fees issued by the International Searching Authority. Any such protest filed with the U.S. International Searching Authority will be decided by a Technology Center Director (**[MPEP § 1002.02(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e116970.html)** item (2)). To the extent applicant’s protest is found to be justified, total or partial reimbursement of the additional fee will be made. On the request of the applicant, the text of both the protest and the decision thereon is sent to the designated Offices together with the international search report (**[37 CFR 1.477(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e328778.html)** ).

## XI.    **NOTIFICATION OF DECISION ON PROTEST**

A Notification of Decision of Protest or Declaration That Protest Considered Not to Have Been Made (Form PCT/ISA/212) is used by the Technology Center (TC) to inform the applicant of the decision regarding applicant’s protest on the payment of additional fees concerning unity of invention. The TC checks the appropriate box, i.e., 1 or 2. If box 2 is checked, a clear and concise explanation as to why the protest concerning the unity of invention was found to be unjustified must be given. Since the space is limited, supplemental attachment sheet(s) should be incorporated whenever necessary.

## XII.    **AUTHORIZED OFFICER**

## XIII.    **UNITY OF INVENTION - NUCLEOTIDE SEQUENCES**

Under **[37 CFR 1.475](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e328679.html)**  and **[1.499 et seq.,](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e329844.html)**  when claims do not comply with the requirement of unity of invention, i.e., when the claimed subject matter does not involve "one or more of the same or corresponding special technical features," **[37 CFR 1.475(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e328679.html)**, an additional fee is required to maintain the claims in the same application. **[37 CFR 1.476(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e328736.html)**.

Nucleotide sequences encoding the same protein are considered to satisfy the unity of invention standard and will continue to be examined together.

Examples concerning Unity of Invention involving biotechnological inventions may be found in Chapter 10 of the International Search and Preliminary Examination Guidelines which can be obtained from the Patent Examiner’s Toolkit link or from the WIPO’s website (**[www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts/ gdlines.html](http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/texts/gdlines.html)** ).

# 1851    Identification of Patent Documents [R-01.2024]

The examiner, in completing the international search report as well as the written opinion and international preliminary examination report, is required to cite the references in accordance with the provisions of Administrative Instructions Sections **[503](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e282967.html)**  and **[611](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e283770.html)**  and WIPO Standard ST.14. These sections of the Administrative Instructions require reference citations to include, in addition to other information which is apparent from the forms which the examiner fills out, an indication of the two-letter country code of the country or entity issuing or publishing the document and the standard code for identifying the kind of patent document. The discussion which follows is limited to the identification of patent documents (and nonpatent publications) and a listing of the two-letter country codes for countries or other entities which issue or publish industrial property information.

The standard codes for identifying different kinds of patent documents are found in the "WIPO Handbook on Industrial Property Information and Documentation" - WIPO Standard ST.16 which is published by the World Intellectual Property Organization. The listing is extensive. The Quality Assurance Specialists in each Technology Center (TC) have a complete copy of Standard ST.16. It is also accessible on WIPO’s website (**[www.wipo.int/standards/en/part_03_standards.html](http://www.wipo.int/standards/en/part_03_standards.html)** ). Provided herein is an abbreviated version representing the countries and codes commonly used by the examiner in preparing search reports.

U.S. patents published before January 2, 2001, are Code A documents generally. Beginning with patents published on January 2, 2001, U.S. patents are Code B documents. Patent Application Publications, first published on March 15, 2001, are Code A documents. Reexamination certificates published before January 2, 2001, are Code B documents. Reexamination certificates published on or after January 2, 2001, are Code C documents. Tables providing a complete list of the kind codes of patents and other documents published by the USPTO are included in **[MPEP §  901.04(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e110444.html)**. All nonpatent literature documents are Code N. Numerical designations are sometimes found on published documents along with the letter code designation. These should be used by the examiner only if such numerical designation is on the document. Numerical codes along with letter codes can be found, for example, on certain published patent documents such as the German Offenlegungsschrift and published international applications. If numerical designations are not provided, the examiner should use only the letter code designation.

The most commonly cited documents are patents and published patent applications. A guideline for the citation of such documents is listed below. The listing is indicated in the order in which the elements should be listed.

In the case of a patent or published patent application:

- (A) The Office that issued the document, by the two letter code (WIPO Standard ST.3);
- (B) The number of the document as given to it by the Office that issued it (for Japanese patent documents the indication of the year of the reign of the Emperor must precede the serial number of the patent document);
- (C) The kind of document, by the appropriate symbols as indicated on the document under WIPO Standard ST.16 or, if not indicated on that document, as provided in that Standard, if possible;
- (D) The name of the patentee or applicant (in capital letters, where appropriate, abbreviated);
- (E) The date of publication of the cited patent document or, in case of a corrected patent document, the date of issuance of the corrected patent document as referred to under INID code (48) of WIPO Standard ST.9 and, if provided on the document, the supplementary correction code as referred to under INID code (15);
- (F) Where applicable, the pages, columns, lines or paragraph numbers where the relevant passages appear, or the relevant figures of the drawings.

The following examples illustrate the citation of a patent document as indicated above:

JP 10-105775 A (NCR INTERNATIONAL INC.) 24 April 1998 (24.04.1998) paragraphs 26 to 30.

DE 3744403 A1 (JOSEK, A.) 29 August 1991 (29-08-1991), page 1, abstract.

US 5,635,683 A (MCDERMOTT, R. M. et al.) 03 June 1997 (03/06/1997), column 7, lines 21 to 40.

##    **STANDARD CODE FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF PATENT DOCUMENTS**

The Code, WIPO Standard ST.16 is subdivided into mutually exclusive groups of letters. The groups characterize patent documents, nonpatent literature documents (N), and restricted documents (X). Groups 1-7 comprise letters enabling identification of documents pertaining to different publication levels.

Part 7.3 "Examples and Kinds of Patent Documents" provides, in the first document (Part 7.3.1), examples of patent documents, previously and currently published, or intended to be published, listed according to code. The second document (Part 7.3.2) contains a listing, in alphabetical order of issuing industrial property office, of kinds of patent documents and their codes, as applied by the offices. Finally, the third document (Part 7.3.3) provides access to a collection of samples of first pages of patent documents published by industrial property offices.

##    **_Country Codes_**

The two-letter country codes are set forth in WIPO Standard ST.3, which is published in the "WIPO Handbook on Industrial Property Information and Documentation" and is accessible via the internet at the WIPO website (**[www.wipo.int/standards/ en/part_03_standards.html](http://www.wipo.int/standards/en/part_03_standards.html)** ). WIPO Standard ST.3 provides, in Annex I, a listing of two-letter country codes and/or organizational codes in alphabetic sequence of their short names for the states, other entities and intergovernmental organizations issuing or publishing industrial property documents. Codes for states or organizations that existed on January 1, 1978, but that no longer exist are provided in Annex II, Section 2. Annex II, Section 1 lists States for which the Codes have changed.

#### _PCT Rule 41_

#### _Taking into Account Results of Earlier Search_

# 41.1 Taking into Account Results of Earlier Search

Where the applicant has, under **[Rule 4.12](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e365863.html##d0e366250)**, requested the International Searching Authority to take into account the results of an earlier search and has complied with **[Rule 12bis.1](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e367499.html##d0e367508)**  and:

- (i) the earlier search was carried out by the same International Searching Authority, or by the same Office as that which is acting as the International Searching Authority, the International Searching Authority shall, to the extent possible, take those results into account in carrying out the international search;
- (ii) the earlier search was carried out by another International Searching Authority, or by an Office other than that which is acting as the International Searching Authority, the International Searching Authority may take those results into account in carrying out the international search.

#### _37 C.F.R. 1.104  Nature of examination._

- (a) _Examiner’s action_.
    - *****
    - (3) An international-type search will be made in all national applications filed on and after June 1, 1978.
    - (4) Any national application may also have an international-type search report prepared thereon at the time of the national examination on the merits, upon specific written request therefor and payment of the international-type search report fee set forth in § **[1.21(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e316474.html)**. The Patent and Trademark Office does not require that a formal report of an international-type search be prepared in order to obtain a search fee refund in a later filed international application.

*****

**[PCT Rule 4.12](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e365863.html##d0e366250)**  provides that the applicant may request that the results of an earlier international, international-type or national search carried out by the same or another International Searching Authority or by a national Office be used in establishing an international search report on such international application.

See **[MPEP § 1819](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e167893.html)**. An international-type search is conducted on all U.S. nonprovisional applications filed after June 1, 1978.

When specifically requested by the applicant, the examiner is required to prepare an international search report taking into account the results of an earlier search. The examiner can determine whether applicant has requested the ISA/US to use the results of an earlier search by inspecting Box No. VII of the PCT Request. Box No. VII of the Request also allows applicant to indicate that certain documents relating to the earlier search are either available to the Authority or are being transmitted thereto.

Where the applicant has requested the United States International Searching Authority (ISA/US) to take into account earlier search results from a foreign Office and where a copy of the earlier search results (and a translation into English where the search results are in a foreign language) and copies of the documents cited therein (other than copies of U.S. patents and U.S. patent application publications) have been provided, the examiner shall take into account such earlier search results. Where the earlier search results (including any required translation thereof) or any copies of the documents cited therein (other than copies of U.S. patents and U.S. patent application publications) have not been furnished and therefore are not of record in the file, whether the earlier foreign Office search results will be taken into account is at the examiner's discretion.

It is emphasized that when taking into account the results of an earlier search, the examiner is not bound by the results of the earlier search. The process of taking into account earlier search results consists of a cursory review of the provided results, followed by a more comprehensive inspection of the cited references if warranted. The forms used in preparing the international search report do not provide for indicating either that the results of an earlier search have been taken into account or the extent to which the results of an earlier search have been taken into account and, accordingly, the examiner need not make such indications in the international search report.

# 1853    Amendment Under PCT Article 19 [R-10.2019]

#### _PCT Article 19_

#### _Amendment of the Claims before the International Bureau_

- (1) The applicant shall, after having received the international search report, be entitled to one opportunity to amend the claims of the international application by filing amendments with the International Bureau within the prescribed time limit. He may, at the same time, file a brief statement, as provided in the Regulations, explaining the amendments and indicating any impact that such amendments might have on the description and the drawings.
- (2) The amendments shall not go beyond the disclosure in the international application as filed.
- (3) If the national law of any designated State permits amendments to go beyond the said disclosure, failure to comply with paragraph (2) shall have no consequence in that State.

    - (ii) shall identify the claims originally filed which, on account of the amendments, are cancelled.
    
    - (iii) shall indicate the basis for the amendments in the application as filed.

#### _PCT Administrative Instructions Section 205_

#### _Numbering and Identification of Claims Upon Amendment_

- (a) Amendments to the claims under **[Article 19](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363565.html)**  or **[Article 34(2)(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364117.html)**  may be made either by cancelling one or more entire claims, by adding one or more new claims or by amending the text of one or more of the claims as filed. Where a claim is cancelled, no renumbering of the other claims shall be required. In all cases where claims are renumbered, they shall be renumbered consecutively in Arabic numerals.
- (b) The applicant shall, in the letter referred to in the second and third sentences of **[Rule 46.5(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e371568.html##d0e371639)**  or **[Rule 66.8(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e374653.html##d0e374951)**  indicate the differences between the claims as filed and the claims as amended or, as the case may be, differences between the claims as previously amended and currently amended. He shall, in particular, indicate in the said letter, in connection with each claim appearing in the international application (it being understood that identical indications concerning several claims may be grouped), whether:
    - (i) the claim is unchanged;
    - (ii) the claim is cancelled;
    - (iii) the claim is new;
    - (iv) the claim replaces one or more claims as filed;
    - (v) the claim is the result of the division of a claim as filed;
    - (vi) the claim replaces one or more claims as previously amended;
    - (vii) the claim is the result of the division of a claim as previously amended

The applicant is entitled, under **[Article 19](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363565.html)**, to one opportunity to amend the claims of the international application in the international phase. Further opportunities to amend the claims, and also the description and the drawings, are available during the international phase under **[Article 34](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364117.html)**  if, and only if, the applicant files a Demand for international preliminary examination. Any amendment to the claims under **[Article 19](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363565.html)**  must be filed with the International Bureau – not with the receiving Office nor with the International Searching Authority. The amendments must be in the language in which the international application is published.

The opportunity to make amendments under **[Article 19](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363565.html)**  is available after the applicant has received the international search report and the written opinion of the International Search Authority, and remains available until the end of 16 months from the priority date or two months after the transmittal (i.e., the date of mailing) of that report and opinion, whichever expires later. Amendments received by the International Bureau after the time limit are still accepted if they have been received before the technical preparations for international publication have been completed. Amendments to the claims under **[Article 19](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363565.html)**  are not allowed where the International Searching Authority has declared, under **[Article 17(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363501.html##d0e363513)**, that no international search report would be established. If the amendments to the claims are timely received by the International Bureau, such amendments will be published as part of the publication of the international application directly following the claims as filed. **[Article 19](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363565.html)**  offers applicants the opportunity to generally amend the claims before entering the designated Offices. The national laws of some designated Offices may grant provisional protection on the invention from the date of publication of the claims. Therefore, some applicants take advantage of the opportunity under **[Article 19](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363565.html)**  to polish the claims anticipating provisional protection. See **[PCT Rule 46.5](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e371568.html##d0e371639)**.

The submission of **[Article 19](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363565.html)**  amendments should comprise:

- (i) a complete set of claims in replacement of the claims originally filed
- (ii) a letter which must indicate the differences between the claims as filed and those as amended plus the basis for the amendments
- (iii) an optional statement under **[Article 19](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363565.html)** 

When filing amendments to the claims under **[Article 19](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363565.html)**, the applicant is required to file a sheet or sheets containing a complete set of claims in replacement of the claims originally filed. The replacement sheet or sheets must be accompanied by a letter drawing attention to the differences between the claims as filed and the claims as amended. It must also indicate the basis for the amendment to the claims with specific references to particular parts of the application as originally filed, as illustrated in the Example below. Where an amendment results in the cancellation of an entire sheet of the international application as originally filed, the amendment (i.e., the cancellation) is evidenced only by the letter addressed to the International Bureau. Amendments may consist in the cancellation of one or more entire claims, in the addition of one or more new claims, or in the amendment of the text of one or more of the claims as filed. All the claims appearing on a replacement sheet must be numbered in Arabic numerals (corresponding to the order of the claims). Where a claim is cancelled, no renumbering of the other claims is required. However, where the applicant does renumber claims, they must be renumbered consecutively.

The letter, which must accompany the replacement sheets containing amendments to the claims, must indicate firstly the differences between the claims as filed and those as amended and secondly the basis for the amendments in the application as filed. This should be done by stating, in connection with each claim appearing in the international application, whether:

- (i) the claim is unchanged,
- (ii) the claim is cancelled;
- (iii) the claim is new;
- (iv) the claim replaces one or more claims as filed;
- (v) the claim is the result of the division of a claim as filed, etc.

The replacement sheets containing the amended claims should not, however, contain marked-up text; they should contain clean text only. This should be followed by an indication of the basis for the amendments in the application as filed. The basis for the amendments has to be indicated so that the examiner may, by consulting those precise references in the application, assess whether the amendments contain subject-matter which extends beyond the disclosure of the application as filed. Therefore, non-specific indications such as "see the description as filed" or "see the claims as filed" are generally not considered sufficient for an indication of the basis for the amendment.

Example:

> "Claim 1 amended; claims 2 to 7 unchanged; claims 8 and 9 amended; claims 10 to 14 cancelled; claims 15 to 17 unchanged; new claim 18 added.
> 
> - (i) Basis for the amendment: Claim 1 has been amended at lines 4 and 11 to 14 and now indicates that the filter comprises a periodic backwashing means serially coupled to a first and second chamber. The basis for this amendment can be found in original claims 2 and 4 as filed.
> - (ii) Basis for the amendment: Concerning amended claims 8 and 9, the indication of ‘quick-fire piston’ is in the paragraphs numbered 2 and 19 in the description as filed.
> - (iii) Basis for the amendment: Claim 18 is new, the indication is in drawing No. III of the original application."

Any amendment may be accompanied by a brief statement by the applicant explaining the amendment and indicating any impact it might have on the description and the drawings. Such a statement is published together with the international application itself. Statements not referring to a specific amendment are not permitted. The statement must not exceed 500 words if in English or when translated into English. It may not contain disparaging comments on the international search report or on the relevance of any of the citations contained in that report. References to certain citations in the report may be made only in connection with an amendment made to a specific claim. The statement must be in the language in which the international application is published.

A statement explaining the amendment is not to be confused with and must be clearly distinguished from the letter indicating the differences between the claims as filed and those as amended and the basis for the amendment. It is also distinct from the statement concerning amendments which must be included in a demand for international preliminary examination. It must therefore be identified as such by a heading "Statement under **[Article 19(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363565.html##d0e363573)**." Where the statement does not comply with the requirements, it is neither published by the International Bureau nor communicated to the designated Offices.

The PCT provides that amendments are not to go beyond the disclosure in the international application as filed. This requirement is not directly enforceable during Chapter I of the international phase, but failure to comply with it may have adverse consequences for the applicant during the international preliminary examination and in the national phase.

- (b) Subject to paragraph (c), **[Article 20(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363585.html##d0e363593)**  and **[Rules 45.1](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e371548.html##d0e371555)**, **[47.1(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e371652.html##d0e371765)**  and **[70.7(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e375320.html##d0e375463)**  shall apply as if the supplementary international search report were part of the international search report.
- (c) A supplementary international search report need not be taken into account by the International Preliminary Examining Authority for the purposes of a written opinion or the international preliminary examination report if it is received by that Authority after it has begun to draw up that opinion or report.

# 45_bis_.9 International Searching Authorities Competent to Carry Out Supplementary International Search

- (a) An International Searching Authority shall be competent to carry out supplementary international searches if its preparedness to do so is stated in the applicable agreement under **[Article 16(3)(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363461.html##d0e363482)**, subject to any limitations and conditions set out in that agreement.
- (b) The International Searching Authority carrying out the international search under **[Article 16(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363461.html##d0e363469)**  in respect of an international application shall not be competent to carry out a supplementary international search in respect of that application.
- (c) The limitations referred to in paragraph (a) may, for example, include limitations as to the subject matter for which supplementary international searches will be carried out, other than limitations under **[Article 17(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363501.html##d0e363513)**  as applicable by virtue of **[Rule 45bis.5(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//Rule45bis.html##at_d1fc9d_18f66_1f9)**, limitations as to the total number of supplementary international searches which will be carried out in a given period, and limitations to the effect that the supplementary international searches will not extend to any claim beyond a certain number of claims.

The supplementary international search (SIS) is an optional service that allows additional searches to be performed by a Supplementary International Searching Authority (SISA) during the international phase, in addition to the search performed by the main International Searching Authority (ISA). Requesting supplementary international search reduces the risk of new prior art being cited in the national phase. The increasing diversity of prior art in different languages and different technical fields means that the Authority carrying out the main international search is not always capable of discovering all of the relevant prior art. Requesting one or more supplementary international searches, during this early phase of the patent prosecution, expands both the linguistic and technical scope of the search. In addition, it may also be possible to have the supplementary search carried out in a State where an applicant is likely to enter the national phase later on.

Only an ISA that has stated its preparedness to carry out supplementary international searches (see the Annex SISA of the Applicant’s Guide at **[www.wipo.int/pct/en/appguide/index.jsp](http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/appguide/index.jsp)** ) and which is not the ISA that carried out the main international search, can be requested to carry out a SIS. The Authorities prepared to offer supplementary international searches may specify any limitations and conditions on this service in their agreement with the IB (see **[www.wipo.int/pct/en/access/ isa_ipea_agreements.html](http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/access/isa_ipea_agreements.html)** ). These limitations may include limitations as to the subject matter for which supplementary searches will be carried out, beyond those limitations that can be evoked in respect of the main international search, and limitations as to the total number of supplementary international searches which will be carried out in a given period.

The SIS will be carried out on the application as filed (amendments under **[PCT Article 19](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363565.html)**  and/or **[34](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364117.html)**  will not be considered) and will only cover one invention or group of inventions having unity of invention – there is no option for paying additional fees for the searching of multiple inventions. However, if the main ISA has identified a lack of unity before SIS is requested, the latter can be requested to concentrate on an invention which is not necessarily the first one claimed (**[PCT Rule 45bis.1(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//Rule45bis.html##at_d1fc9d_149d9_3d6)** ). If not established in English, the resulting supplementary international search report will be translated into English by the IB.

In many cases, requests for supplementary search will be filed once the applicant has received the main international search report. In any event, the applicant must file a request for a SIS prior to the expiration of 22 months from the priority date. If the request is received after the expiration of this time limit, it will be considered not to have been submitted and there are no provisions to extend this time limit. The requests for SIS must be submitted directly to the IB and not to an individual SISA. There is a supplementary search handling fee to cover the costs of the IB and a supplementary search fee set by each SISA. These fees must be paid to the IB in Swiss francs within one month of filing the request for SIS. Applicants from certain States may be eligible for a 90% reduction in the supplementary search handling fee.

# 90_bis_.5 Signature

- Any notice of withdrawal referred to in **[Rules 90bis.1](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377369.html##d0e377378)**  to **[90bis.4](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377369.html##d0e377490)**  shall be signed by the applicant or, if there are two or more applicants, by all of them.

- (b) The notification referred to in paragraph (a) shall be promptly published by the International Bureau in the Gazette, and shall have effect in respect of international applications filed more than one month after the date of such publication.

For a discussion of the withdrawal of the demand or of elections ( **[PCT Rule 90bis.4](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377369.html##d0e377490)** ), see **[MPEP § 1880](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e189477.html)**.

Form PCT/IB/372 may be used by the applicant to make a withdrawal under any of **[PCT Rules 90bis.1](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377369.html##d0e377378)**, **[90bis.2](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377369.html##d0e377404)**, **[90bis.3](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377369.html##d0e377450)**, and **[90bis.4](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377369.html##d0e377490)**. The form is available from WIPO’s website (**[www.wipo.int/pct/ en/forms/](http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/forms/)** ).

The applicant may withdraw the international application, the designation of any state, or a priority claim by a notice addressed to the International Bureau or to the receiving Office and received before the expiration of 30 months from the priority date. Where Article 39(1) applies, the notice may also be addressed to the International Preliminary Examining Authority. Any such withdrawal is free of charge. A notice of withdrawal must be signed by all the applicants. The provisions for waiver of a power of attorney set forth in **[PCT Rules 90.4(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377138.html##d0e377231)**  and **[90.5(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377138.html##d0e377280)**  do not apply in the case of withdrawals under **[PCT Rule 90bis.](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377369.html)**  An appointed agent or appointed common representative may sign such a notice on behalf of the applicant or applicants who appointed him, but an applicant who is considered to be the common representative may not sign such a notice on behalf of the other applicants. For international applications filed prior to January 1, 2013, please see the version of **[PCT Rule 90bis.5](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e377369.html)**  in effect at that time.

The applicant may prevent international publication by withdrawing the international application, provided that the notice of withdrawal reaches the International Bureau before the completion of technical preparations for that publication. The notice of withdrawal may state that the withdrawal is to be effective only on the condition that international publication can still be prevented. In such a case the withdrawal is not effective if the condition on which it was made cannot be met - i.e., if the technical preparations for international publication have already been completed.

If all designations are withdrawn, the international application will be treated as withdrawn.

Where the withdrawal of a priority claim causes a change in the priority date of the international application, any time limit which is computed from the original priority date and which has not yet expired—for example, the time limit before which processing in the national phase cannot start—is computed from the priority date resulting from the change. (It is not possible to extend the time limit concerned if it has already expired when the priority claim is withdrawn.) Thus, international publication may be postponed by withdrawing the priority claim prior to publication. However, if the notice of withdrawal reaches the International Bureau after the completion of the technical preparations for international publication, the International Bureau may proceed with the international publication on the basis of the time limit for international publication as computed from the original priority date.

# 1860    International Preliminary Examination Procedure [R-01.2024]

## I.    **EXAMINATION PROCEDURE**

The international preliminary examination is to be carried out in accordance with **[PCT Article 34](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364117.html)**  and **[PCT Rule 66](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e374653.html)**. After the demand is checked for compliance with **[PCT Rules 53](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e373302.html)**  - **[55](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e373640.html)**, **[57](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e373786.html)**  and **[58](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e373909.html)**, the first step of the examiner is to study the description, the drawings (if any), the claims of the international application, the documents describing the prior art as cited in the international search report, and the written opinion established by the International Searching Authority. Furthermore, the examiner shall search at least to the point of bringing the previous search up to date and any new prior art discovered and applied must be made of record. See **[PCT Rule 66.1ter](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e374653.html##at_d224ee_1e87d_350)**.

A further written opinion is usually not mandatory where the written opinion of the International Searching Authority is treated as the first written opinion of the International Preliminary Examining Authority. The United States International Preliminary Examining Authority will treat any written opinion of the International Searching Authority established by the USPTO, EPO, KIPO, IP Australia, ILPO, JPO, or IPOS as the first written opinion of the International Preliminary Examining Authority.

Assuming the written opinion of the International Searching Authority is treated as the first written opinion of the International Preliminary Examining Authority, as noted above, no further written opinion need be issued before the international preliminary examination report, even if there are objections outstanding. The examiner takes into consideration any comments or amendments made by the applicant when establishing the international preliminary examination report.

## II.    **FURTHER WRITTEN OPINION SHOULD BE ISSUED**

A further written opinion should be prepared by the examiner if applicant files a response which includes a persuasive argument that the written opinion issued by the International Searching Authority was improper because of a negative opinion with respect to a lack of novelty, inventive step (non-obviousness) or industrial applicability as described in **[PCT Article 33(2) - (4)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364085.html)**; and which results in the examiner considering any of the claims to lack novelty, inventive step (non-obviousness) or industrial applicability as described in **[PCT Article 33(2) - (4)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364085.html)**  based on new art not necessitated by any amendment.

Any further written opinion established by the International Preliminary Examining Authority should set forth, as applicable:

- (A) Any defects in the international application as described in **[PCT Article 34(4)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364117.html)**  concerning subject matter which is not required to be examined or which is unclear or inadequately supported;
- (B) Any negative findings with respect to any of the claims because of a lack of novelty, inventive step (non-obviousness) or industrial applicability as described in **[PCT Article 33(2) - (4)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364085.html)**;
- (C) Any defects in the form or contents of the international application;
- (D) Any finding by the examiner that an amendment goes beyond the disclosure in the international application as originally filed;
- (E) Any observation which the examiner wishes to make on the clarity of the claims, the description, the drawings or to the question whether the claims are fully supported by the description (**[PCT Rule 66.2](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e374653.html##d0e374790)** );
- (F) Any decision by the examiner not to carry out the international preliminary examination on a claim for which no international search report was issued; or
- (G) If the examiner considers that no acceptable nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence listing is available in a form that would allow a meaningful international preliminary examination to be carried out.

The further written opinion is prepared on Form PCT/IPEA/408 to notify applicant of the defects found in the international application. The examiner is further required to fully state the reasons for the opinion (**[PCT Rule 66.2(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e374653.html##d0e374790)** ) and invite a written reply, with amendments where appropriate (**[PCT Rule 66.2(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e374653.html##d0e374790)** ), normally setting a 2 month time limit for the reply.

The applicant may reply to the invitation by making amendments or, if applicant disagrees with the opinion of the examiner, by submitting arguments, as the case may be, or both.

The U.S. Rules of Practice pertaining to international preliminary examination of international applications permit a second written opinion in those cases where sufficient time is available. Normally only one written opinion will be issued. Any reply received after the expiration of the set time limit will not normally be considered in preparing the international preliminary examination report. In situations, however, where the examiner has requested an amendment or where a later amendment places the application in better condition for examination, the amendment may be considered by the examiner.

If the applicant does not reply to any further written opinion established by the International Preliminary Examining Authority within the set time period, the international preliminary examination report will be prepared after expiration of the time limit plus sufficient time to have any reply clear the Mail Center.

# 1864    The Demand and Preparation for Filing of Demand [R-07.2015]

#### _37 C.F.R. 1.480  Demand for international preliminary examination._

- (a) On the filing of a proper Demand in an application for which the United States International Preliminary Examining Authority is competent and for which the fees have been paid, the international application shall be the subject of an international preliminary examination. The preliminary examination fee (§ **[1.482(a)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e328929.html)** ) and the handling fee (§ **[1.482(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e328929.html)** ) shall be due within the applicable time limit set forth in **[PCT Rule 57.3](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e373786.html##d0e373835)**.
- (b) The Demand shall be made on a standardized form (**[PCT Rule 53](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e373302.html)** ). Copies of the printed Demand forms are available from the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Letters requesting printed Demand forms should be marked "Mail Stop PCT."
- (c) Withdrawal of a proper Demand prior to the start of the international preliminary examination will entitle applicant to a refund of the preliminary examination fee minus the amount of the transmittal fee set forth in § **[1.445(a)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e328174.html)**.
- (d) The filing of a Demand shall constitute the election of all Contracting States which are designated and are bound by Chapter II of the Treaty on the international filing date (**[PCT Rule 53.7](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e373302.html##d0e373429)** ).
- (e) Any Demand filed after the expiration of the applicable time limit set forth in **[PCT Rule 54bis.1(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e373594.html)**  shall be considered as if it had not been submitted (**[PCT Rule 54 bis.1(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e373594.html)** ).

Once applicant has filed an international application under Chapter I of the PCT, applicant has the right to file a demand for preliminary examination under Chapter II of the Treaty. The use of the term "Demand" distinguishes Chapter II from the "Request" under Chapter I. It is not possible to file a demand unless a proper Chapter I "Request" for an international application has been filed. Chapter I affords applicant the benefit of an international search, which includes an international search report and a written opinion established by the International Searching Authority. The filing of a demand affords applicant examination of the application and allows applicant to file amendments to the description, claims and drawings to correct any defects, respond to any observations, or address negative findings with respect to any of the claims because of a lack of novelty, inventive step (non-obviousness) or industrial applicability as described in **[PCT Article 33(2) - (4)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364085.html)**  mentioned in the written opinion (Form PCT/ISA/237) established by the International Searching Authority. Thus, examination enables applicant to attempt to obtain a positive international preliminary examination report, which in some elected Offices is used as a basis for the issuance of a patent or acceleration programs, e.g., Patent Prosecution Highway.

The demand should be filed on Form PCT/IPEA/401 along with the fee calculation sheet. The form is available free of charge on WIPO’s website at **[www.wipo.int/pct/en/forms/index.html](http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/forms/index.html)**.

#### _37 C.F.R. 1.485  Amendments by applicant during international preliminary examination._

The applicant may make amendments at the time of filing the Demand. The applicant may also make amendments within the time limit set by the International Preliminary Examining Authority for reply to any notification under § **[1.484(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e328982.html##d0e328994)**  or to any written opinion. Any such amendments must be made in accordance with **[PCT Rule 66.8](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e374653.html##d0e374951)**.

Under **[PCT Article 34(2)(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364117.html)**, the applicant has a right to amend the claims, the description, and the drawings in the application before the International Preliminary Examining Authority (IPEA) before the international preliminary examination report is established. The amendment may be filed with the demand (**[PCT Article 34](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364117.html)** ), within the period for reply to the written opinion of the International Searching Authority (ISA), or within the period for reply to the written opinion of the IPEA.

See **[MPEP § 1871](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e184604.html)** regarding the processing of amendments filed prior to or at the start of international preliminary examination. See **[MPEP § 1878.02](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e187853.html)** regarding amendments filed in reply to the written opinion of the ISA or IPEA.

The applicant must submit a replacement sheet for every sheet which, on account of an amendment, differs from the sheet previously filed. The amendment must be submitted with an accompanying letter which explains the difference between the replaced sheet and the replacement sheet and which preferably explains the reasons for the amendment. In addition, the letter must indicate the basis for the amendment in the application. The basis for the amendment must always refer to the application (description, claims, drawings) as originally filed, even if multiple amendments were made during the international phase. When filing amendments to the claims, a complete set of claims in replacement of the claims as originally filed (or previously amended under **[Article 19](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363565.html)** ) shall be submitted. For an example of how the basis for the amendment should be indicated, see **[MPEP § 1853](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e181649.html)**. Where the amendment consists in the deletion of passages or in minor alterations or additions, the alterations or additions may be made on a copy of the relevant sheet of the international application, provided that the clarity and direct reproducibility of that sheet are not adversely affected. No replacement sheet is required where the amendment results in the cancellation of an entire sheet; such an amendment may be communicated in a letter which preferably explains the reasons for the amendment.

Where the international application was not filed in the language of publication, any amendments under **[Article 34](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364117.html)**  and any accompanying letter (as well as any letter accompanying **[Article 19](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363565.html)**  amendments) must be in the language of publication. Where the international preliminary examination is carried out on the basis of a translation of the international application, any amendments under **[Article 34](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364117.html)**  and any amendments under **[Article 19](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363565.html)**, which are to be taken into account, and any accompanying letter must be in the language of that translation. Where such amendments have been or are filed in another language, a translation of the amendments into the language in which the international preliminary examination is carried out must also be furnished. No fee is payable in respect of filing any amendments under **[Article 34(2)(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364117.html##d0e364134)**. If the amendments or accompanying letter are not in the required language, the International Preliminary Examining Authority will invite the applicant to furnish them within a reasonable time limit. If the applicant fails to furnish the amendments and/or the accompanying letter within the time limit set in the invitation, the International Preliminary Examining Authority shall not take such amendments into account for the purposes of the international preliminary examination.

#### _PCT Article 31_

#### _Demand for International Preliminary Examination_

*****

- (4)
    - (a) The demand shall indicate the Contracting State or States in which the applicant intends to use the results of the international preliminary examination ("elected States"). Additional Contracting States may be elected later. Election may relate only to Contracting States already designated under **[Article 4](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363086.html)**.
    - (b) Applicants referred to in paragraph (2)(a) may elect any Contracting State bound by Chapter II. Applicants referred to in paragraph (2)(b) may elect only such Contracting States bound by Chapter II as have declared that they are prepared to be elected by such applicants.

*****

The filing of a demand shall constitute the election of all Contracting States which are designated and are bound by Chapter II of the Treaty on the international filing date (**[PCT Rule 53.7](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e373302.html##d0e373429)** ). For demands filed before January 1, 2004, only those eligible states pursuant to **[PCT Article 31](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363993.html)**  indicated as being elected are elected. Only PCT member states which have ratified or acceded to Chapter II and which were designated in the Request may be elected under Chapter II. The Assembly has taken no action to allow persons who are residents or nationals of a State not party to the PCT or not bound by Chapter II to make a Demand under **[Article 31(2)(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363993.html)**.

# 1864.04    Agent’s Right To Act [R-08.2012]

Any agent entitled to practice before the receiving Office where the international application was filed may represent the applicant before the international authorities ( **[PCT Article 49](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364541.html)** ).

If for any reason, the examiner needs to question the right of an attorney or agent to practice before the International Preliminary Examining Authority (IPEA), the USPTO roster of registered attorneys and agents should be consulted. If the international application was filed with a receiving Office other than the United States, Form PCT/IPEA/410 may be used by the requesting IPEA to ask the receiving Office with which the international application was filed, whether the agent named in the international application has the right to practice before that Office.

The PCT Article and Regulations governing the right to practice are **[PCT Article 49](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364541.html)**  and **[PCT Rule 83](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e376591.html)**.

*****

Applicants should submit the Demand and appropriate fees directly to the International Preliminary Examining Authority (IPEA) they desire to prepare the International Preliminary Examination Report. The demand must be filed prior to the expiration of whichever of the following periods expires later: (A) three months from the date of transmittal to the applicant of the international search report and the written opinion; or (B) 22 months from the priority date. Otherwise the demand shall be considered as if it had not been submitted and the International Preliminary Examining Authority shall so declare. See **[PCT Rule 54](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e373512.html)**. In order to take advantage of a national phase entry time limit of at least 30 months from the priority date in relation to all States designated in the international application, it may be necessary to file a demand before the expiration of 19 months from the priority date. See **[MPEP § 1842](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e171994.html)**, subsection VII.A.

##    **CHOICE OF INTERNATIONAL PRELIMINARY EXAMINING AUTHORITY**

The IPEA/US will serve as International Preliminary Examining Authority for U.S. residents and nationals if the USPTO, EPO, KIPO, IP Australia, ILPO, JPO or IPOS served as the International Searching Authority (ISA) and the international application was filed in the U.S. receiving Office or the International Bureau as receiving Office.

The IPEA/US will also serve as International Preliminary Examining Authority for residents or nationals of Bahrain, Barbados, Brazil, Chile, Dominican Republic, Egypt, Georgia, Guatemala, India, Israel, Jordan, Mexico, New Zealand, Oman, Panama, Peru, the Philippines, Qatar, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, South Africa, Thailand, and Trinidad and Tobago if the USPTO was the ISA.

U.S. residents and nationals may also choose to have the international preliminary examination done by KIPO if the USPTO, EPO, KIPO, IP Australia, ILPO, JPO, or IPOS served as the ISA.

U.S. residents and nationals may choose to have the international preliminary examination done by the EPO if the EPO served as the ISA.

U.S. residents and nationals may choose to have the international preliminary examination done by IP Australia if IP Australia served as the ISA and IP Australia has not received more than 250 international applications from the USPTO during the fiscal quarter.

U.S. residents and nationals may choose to have the international preliminary examination done by ILPO if ILPO served as the ISA. ILPO has certain restrictions of competency as an IPEA based upon the subject matter of the application.

U.S. residents and nationals may choose to have the international preliminary examination done by the JPO if the JPO served as the ISA.

U.S. residents and nationals may choose to have the international preliminary examination done by the IPOS if the IPOS served as the ISA.

Information regarding the demand filing with the specific IPEA is available on the PCT Applicant’s Guide at WIPO’s website (**[www.wipo.int/pct/en/appguide/](http://www.wipo.int/pct/en/appguide/)** ).

Demands filed in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) should preferably be filed via the USPTO patent electronic filing system by registered users in an application filed with the U.S. receiving office or searched by the USPTO. Filers who are not registered users of the USPTO patent electronic filing system must file the demand by another acceptable method.

To avoid unnecessary work and communication by the USPTO, applicants should not file a courtesy copy of a Demand with the USPTO, because the U.S. International Preliminary Examining Authority will process the Demand. If the USPTO is not a competent IPEA, the Demand will be forwarded to the IB.

If mailed to the USPTO, the Demand should be addressed as follows:

Mailing address for delivery by the U.S. Postal Service:

Mail Stop PCT

Commissioner for Patents

P.O. Box 1450

Alexandria, VA 22313-1450

OR

If hand-carried directly to the USPTO, papers should be addressed to "Mail Stop PCT." See **[MPEP § 501](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e24257.html)**, subsection III for information regarding hand-delivery of papers.

The Priority Mail Express® provisions of **[37 CFR 1.10](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e313951.html)**  may be used to file a Demand under Chapter II in the USPTO. Applicants are advised that failure to comply with the provisions of **[37 CFR 1.10](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e313951.html)**  will result in the paper or fee being accorded the date of receipt and not the date of deposit. See **[MPEP § 513](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e33501.html)**.

Demand for international preliminary examination may also be submitted to the USPTO via facsimile. The Certificate of Mailing or Transmission practice under **[37 CFR 1.8](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e313726.html)**  CANNOT be used to file a Demand if the date of deposit is desired. If used, the date of the Demand will be the date of receipt in the USPTO. See **[MPEP §§ 513](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e33501.html)**, **[1834](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e170737.html)**, and **[1834.01](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e170909.html)**.

All Demands filed in the USPTO must be in the English language.

**[PCT Rule 59.3](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e374060.html##d0e374126)**  provides a safeguard in the case of a Demand filed with an International Preliminary Examining Authority which is not competent for the international preliminary examination of a particular international application. The USPTO will forward such a Demand to the International Bureau and the International Bureau will forward the Demand to a competent International Preliminary Examining Authority pursuant to **[PCT Rule 59.3(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e374060.html##d0e374126)**. The competent International Preliminary Examining Authority will process the Demand based on the date of receipt in the USPTO. See **[37 CFR 1.416(c)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e327579.html)**.

# 1867    Preliminary Examination Fees [R-07.2015]

#### _37 C.F.R. 1.481  Payment of international preliminary examination fees._

- (a) The handling and preliminary examination fees shall be paid within the time period set in **[PCT Rule 57.3](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e373786.html##d0e373835)**. The handling fee or preliminary examination fee payable is the handling fee or preliminary examination fee in effect on the date of payment.
    - (1) If the handling and preliminary fees are not paid within the time period set in **[PCT Rule 57.3](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e373786.html##d0e373835)**, applicant will be notified and given one month within which to pay the deficient fees plus a late payment fee equal to the greater of:
        - (i) Fifty percent of the amount of the deficient fees, but not exceeding an amount equal to double the handling fee; or
        - (ii) An amount equal to the handling fee (**[PCT Rule 58bis.2](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e373909.html)** ).
    - (2) The one-month time limit set in this paragraph to pay deficient fees may not be extended.
- (b) If the payment needed to cover the handling and preliminary examination fees, pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, is not timely made in accordance with **[PCT Rule 58bis.1(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e373909.html)**, the United States International Preliminary Examination Authority will declare the Demand to be considered as if it had not been submitted.

The preliminary examination fee is for the benefit of the International Preliminary Examining Authority and the amount for the USPTO doing the preliminary examination is specified in **[37 CFR 1.482](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e328929.html)**. The fee is somewhat higher if the international search was performed by an authority other than the USPTO.

The handling fee is a fee for the benefit of the International Bureau and is collected by the International Preliminary Examining Authority.

The current amount of both the preliminary examination fee and the handling fee can be found in each weekly issue of the _Official Gazette._ Since supplements to the handling fee were deleted, no additional Chapter II fees are required other than any additional preliminary examination fee where additional inventions are determined to be present. The amount of this fee is also specified in **[37 CFR 1.482](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e328929.html)**  and in the weekly issues of the _Official Gazette_. See also **[PCT Rules 57](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e373786.html)**  and **[58](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e373909.html)**.

The time limit for paying the preliminary examination fee and the handling fee is set forth in **[PCT Rules 57.3](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e373786.html##d0e373835)**  and **[58.1(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e373909.html##d0e373916)**. **[37 CFR 1.481(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e328876.html)**  provides that the preliminary examination fee or handling fee payable is the preliminary examination fee or handling fee in effect on the date of payment. The preliminary examination fee and handling fee are considered to have been received before the expiration of the time limit set in **[PCT Rule 57.3](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e373786.html##d0e373835)**  if the fees were submitted prior to the sending of an invitation to pay the fees. See **[PCT Rule 58bis.1(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e373959.html##d0e373968)**.

**[PCT Rule 58bis.1(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e373959.html##d0e373968)**  permits the International Preliminary Examining Authority to collect a late payment fee set forth in **[PCT Rule 58 bis.2](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e373959.html##d0e374027)**  if the fees for preliminary examination are not paid prior to the sending of the invitation to pay the fees. If the preliminary examination fee and handling fee are not paid within the time set in **[PCT Rule 57.3](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e373786.html##d0e373835)**, applicants will be notified and given 1 month within which to pay the deficient fees plus a late payment fee equal to the greater of: (1) 50% of the amount of the deficient fees, but not exceeding an amount equal to double the handling fee; or (2) an amount equal to the handling fee. See **[37 CFR 1.481(a)(1)(i) and (ii)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e328876.html)**. The 1 month time limit set forth in **[37 CFR 1.481(a)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e328876.html)**  to pay deficient fees may not be extended. See **[37 CFR 1.481(a)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e328876.html)**.

If the payment needed to cover the preliminary examination fee and handling fee is not timely made in accordance with **[PCT Rule 58 bis.1(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e373959.html##d0e373968)**, the United States International Preliminary Examining Authority will declare the Demand to be considered as if it had not been submitted. In this regard, where the Authority sends a notification that the Demand is considered not to have been made and applicant’s payment is received on the same date the notification is sent, the fee is considered to be late and the notification remains effective. The fee must antedate the notice in order for the notice not to be effective. See **[37 CFR 1.481(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e328876.html)**.

If that copy is not furnished to the International Preliminary Examining Authority because the applicant failed to comply with the requirements of **[Rule 17.1](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e368311.html##d0e368318)**, and if that earlier application was not filed with that Authority in its capacity as a national Office or the priority document is not available to that Authority from a digital library in accordance with the Administrative Instructions, the international preliminary examination report may be established as if the priority had not been claimed.
- (b) If the application whose priority is claimed in the international application is in a language other than the language or one of the languages of the International Preliminary Examining Authority, that Authority may, where the validity of the priority claim is relevant for the formulation of the opinion referred to in **[Article 33(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364085.html)**, invite the applicant to furnish a translation in the said language or one of the said languages within two months from the date of the invitation. If the translation is not furnished within that time limit, the international preliminary examination report may be established as if the priority had not been claimed.

*****

A copy of the priority document and/or a translation thereof, if the priority document is not in English may be required by the examiner if necessary because of an intervening reference.

- (a) Subject to paragraph (b), when amending the description or the drawings, the applicant shall be required to submit a replacement sheet for every sheet of the international application which, on account of an amendment, differs from the sheet previously filed. The replacement sheet or sheets shall be accompanied by a letter which shall draw attention to the differences between the replaced sheets and the replacement sheets, shall indicate the basis for the amendment in the application as filed and shall preferably also explain the reasons for the amendment.
- (b) Where the amendment consists in the deletion of passages or in minor alterations or additions, the replacement sheet referred to in paragraph (a) may be a copy of the relevant sheet of the international application containing the alterations or additions, provided that the clarity and direct reproducibility of that sheet are not adversely affected. To the extent that any amendment results in the cancellation of an entire sheet, that amendment shall be communicated in a letter which shall preferably also explain the reasons for the amendment.
- (c) When amending the claims, **[Rule 46.5](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e371568.html##d0e371639)**  shall apply _mutatis mutandis_. The set of claims submitted under **[Rule 46.5](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e371568.html##d0e371639)**  as applicable by virtue of this paragraph shall replace all the claims originally filed or previously amended under **[Articles 19](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363565.html)**  or **[34](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364117.html)**, as the case may be.

The documents making up the international application may include amendments of the claims filed by the applicant under **[PCT Article 19](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363565.html)**. **[Article 19](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363565.html)**  amendments are exclusively amendments to the claims and these amendments can only be made after the international search report has been established. **[Article 19](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363565.html)**  amendments, any statement referred to in that Article, and the letter required under **[PCT Rule 46.5(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e371568.html##at_d1fc9d_2c51a_38d)**  will be transmitted to the International Preliminary Examining Authority (IPEA) by the International Bureau unless that Authority has indicated that it has already received such a copy. The International Bureau marks, in the upper right-hand corner of each replacement sheet submitted under **[PCT Article 19](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363565.html)**, the international application number, the date on which that sheet was received under **[PCT Article 19](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363565.html)**  and, in the middle of the bottom margin, the words "AMENDED SHEET (ARTICLE 19)." Where a demand for international preliminary examination has been submitted to the IPEA/US and a copy of the **[PCT Article 19](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363565.html)**  amendments has not yet been received from the IB, applicant may consider filing a copy directly with the IPEA/US. If the copy of the **[PCT Article 19](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363565.html)**  amendments has not been stamped as "AMENDED SHEET (ARTICLE 19)" by the IB, the IPEA/US will treat the unstamped copy as an amendment under **[PCT Article 34](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364117.html)**.

The IPEA starts the international preliminary examination when it is in possession of the demand; the required fees; if the applicant is required to furnish a translation under **[PCT Rule 55.2](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e373640.html##d0e373660)**, that translation; either the international search report or a notice of the declaration by the International Searching Authority under **[PCT Article 17(2)(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363501.html)**  that no international search report will be established; and the written opinion established under **[PCT Rule 43bis.1](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e371120.html##d0e371129)**, unless the applicant expressly requests to postpone the start of the international preliminary examination until the expiration of the later of three months from the transmittal of the international search report, or declaration that no international search report will be established, and written opinion; or the expiration of 22 months from the priority date, with the exception of the following situations:

- (A) If the competent IPEA is part of the same national Office or intergovernmental organization as the competent International Searching Authority, the international preliminary examination may, if the IPEA so wishes, start at the same time as the international search, provided that the examination is not to be postponed according to the statement concerning **[PCT Article 19](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363565.html)**  amendments (**[PCT Rule 53.9(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e373302.html##d0e373466)** );
- (B) Where the statement concerning amendments contains an indication that amendments made with the International Bureau under **[PCT Article 19](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363565.html)**  are to be taken into account (**[PCT Rule 53.9(a)(i)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e373302.html##d0e373466)** ), the IPEA does not start the international preliminary examination before it has received a copy of the amendments concerned, any statement referred to in that Article and the letter required under **[PCT Rule 46.5(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e371568.html##at_d1fc9d_2c51a_38d)**. These will be transmitted to the IPEA by the International Bureau. The applicant should preferably, at the time the applicant files the demand, also file a copy of the amendments, any statement referred to in that Article and the letter required under **[PCT Rule 46.5(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e371568.html##at_d1fc9d_2c51a_38d)**  with the IPEA;
- (C) Where the statement concerning amendments contains an indication that the start of the international preliminary examination is to be postponed (**[PCT Rule 53.9(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e373302.html##d0e373466)** ), the IPEA does not start the international preliminary examination before:
    
    - (1) it has received a copy of any amendments made under **[PCT Article 19](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363565.html)**, any statement referred to in that Article and the letter required under **[Rule 46.5(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e371568.html##at_d1fc9d_2c51a_38d)**;
    - (2) it has received a notice from the applicant that the applicant does not wish to make amendments under **[PCT Article 19](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363565.html)**; or
    - (3) the later of two months from the transmittal of the international search report or the expiration of 16 months from the priority date;
    
    whichever occurs first; and
    
- (D) Where the statement concerning amendments contains an indication that amendments under **[PCT Article 34](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364117.html)**  are submitted with the demand (**[PCT Rule 53.9(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e373302.html##d0e373466)** ) but no such amendments are, in fact, submitted, the IPEA does not start the international preliminary examination before it has received the amendments or before the time limit fixed in the invitation referred to in **[PCT Rule 60.1(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e374175.html##d0e374182)**  has expired, whichever occurs first.

The applicant has the right to amend the claims, the description, and the drawings, in the prescribed manner and before the start of international preliminary examination. The amendment must not go beyond the disclosure in the international application as filed. These amendments are referred to as **[PCT Article 34(2)(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364117.html)**  amendments. It should be noted that **[PCT Article 19](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363565.html)**  amendments are strictly amendments to the claims made during the Chapter I search phase while **[PCT Article 34(2)(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364117.html)**  amendments to the description, claims, and drawings are made during the Chapter II examination phase.

When amendments to the description or drawings are made under **[PCT Rule 66.8](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e374653.html##d0e374951)**, the applicant shall be required to submit a replacement sheet for every sheet of the international application which, on account of an amendment, differs from the sheet previously filed. The replacement sheet or sheets shall be accompanied by a letter which shall draw attention to the differences between the replaced sheets and the replacement sheets, shall indicate the basis for the amendment in the application as filed and shall preferably also explain the reasons for the amendment. When amendments to the claims are made under **[PCT Rule 66.8](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e374653.html##d0e374951)**, the applicant shall be required to submit a replacement sheet or sheets containing a complete set of claims in replacement of all the claims originally filed or previously amended under **[Articles 19](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363565.html)**  or **[34](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364117.html)**, as the case may be. The replacement sheet or sheets must be accompanied by a letter that identifies the claims which, on account of the amendments, differ from the claims originally filed, and shall (A) draw attention to the differences between the claims originally filed and the claims as amended, (B) identify the claims originally filed which, on account of the amendments, are cancelled, and (C) indicate the basis for the amendments in the application as filed. These amendments may have been submitted to avoid possible objections as to lack of novelty or lack of inventive step in view of the citations listed in the international search report and the observations on novelty, inventive step, and industrial applicability set forth in the written opinion established by the International Searching Authority; to meet any objections noted by the International Searching Authority under **[PCT Article 17(2)(a)(ii)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363501.html)**  (i.e., that all or at least some claims do not permit a meaningful search) or under **[PCT Rule 13](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e367565.html)**  (i.e., that there is a lack of unity of invention); or to meet objections that may be raised for some other reason, e.g., to remedy some obscurity which the applicant has noted in the original documents.

The amendments are made by the applicant of the applicant’s own volition. This means that the applicant is not restricted to amendments necessary to remedy a defect in the international application. It does not, however, mean that the applicant should be regarded as free to amend in any way the applicant chooses. Any amendment must not add subject matter which goes beyond the disclosure of the international application as originally filed. Furthermore, it should not itself cause the international application as amended to be objectionable under the PCT, e.g., the amendment should not introduce obscurity.

As a matter of policy and to ensure consistency in handling amendments filed under **[Articles 19](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363565.html)**  and **[34](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e364117.html)**  of the PCT, the following guidelines for processing these amendments have been established:

- (A) Any argument or amendment which complies with **[37 CFR 1.485](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e329040.html)**  will be considered;
- (B) Amendments filed after the demand:
    - (1) will be considered if filed before the expiration of the applicable time limit under **[PCT Rule 54bis.1(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e373594.html##d0e373614)**  which is the later of:
        
        - (a) three months from the transmittal of either the international search report or a notice of the declaration by the International Searching Authority under **[PCT Article 17(2)(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e363501.html)**  that no international search report will be established, and the written opinion established under **[PCT Rule 43bis.1](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e370901.html)**; or
        - (b) the expiration of 22 months from the priority date.
        
        Note however, that if applicant did not expressly request to postpone the start of the international preliminary examination until the expiration of the time limit under **[PCT Rule 54bis.1(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e373594.html##d0e373614)**, then the examiner is not required to consider the post-Demand amendment, even if such amendment is filed before the expiration of the applicable time limit under **[PCT Rule 54bis.1(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e373594.html##d0e373614)**.
        
    - (2) will be considered if filed before the application is docketed to the examiner. To ascertain if the application has been docketed to the examiner, check the USPTO patent electronic filing system or contact the PCT Help Desk. See **[MPEP § 1730](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e163752.html#//d0e163385.html)**, subsection III.
    - (3) may be considered if filed after docketing. The examiner has discretion to consider such amendments if the examiner determines that the amendment places the application in better condition for examination or the examiner determines that the amendment should otherwise be entered.
- (C) Amendments and/or arguments filed after expiration of the period for response to the written opinion:
    - (1) will be considered if the amendment was requested by the examiner,
    - (2) need not be taken into account for the purposes of a further written opinion or the interna
