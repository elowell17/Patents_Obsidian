# 1.2    Business to be transacted in writing.

All business with the Patent and Trademark Office should be transacted in writing. The personal attendance of applicants or their attorneys or agents at the Patent and Trademark Office is unnecessary. The action of the Patent and Trademark Office will be based exclusively on the written record in the Office. No attention will be paid to any alleged oral promise, stipulation, or understanding in relation to which there is disagreement or doubt.

# 1.3    Business to be conducted with decorum and courtesy.

Applicants and their attorneys or agents are required to conduct their business with the United States Patent and Trademark Office with decorum and courtesy. Papers presented in violation of this requirement will be submitted to the Director and will not be entered. A notice of the non-entry of the paper will be provided. Complaints against examiners and other employees must be made in correspondence separate from other papers.

[Amended, 61 FR 56439, Nov. 1, 1996, effective Dec. 2, 1996; revised, 68 FR 14332, Mar. 25, 2003, effective May 1, 2003; revised, 68 FR 38611, June 30, 2003, effective July 30, 2003]

# 1.4    Nature of correspondence and signature requirements.

- (a) Correspondence with the Patent and Trademark Office comprises:
    - (1) Correspondence relating to services and facilities of the Office, such as general inquiries, requests for publications supplied by the Office, orders for printed copies of patents, orders for copies of records, transmission of assignments for recording, and the like, and
    - (2) _Correspondence in and relating to a particular application or other proceeding in the Office._ See particularly the rules relating to the filing, processing, or other proceedings of national applications in subpart B of this part; of international applications in subpart C of this part; of _ex parte_ reexaminations of patents in subpart D of this part; of supplemental examination of patents in subpart E of this part; of extension of patent term in subpart F of this part; of _inter partes_ reexaminations of patents in subpart H of this part; of international design applications in subpart I of this part; and of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board in parts 41 and 42 of this chapter.
- (b) Since each file must be complete in itself, a separate copy of every paper to be filed in a patent application, patent file, or other proceeding must be furnished for each file to which the paper pertains, even though the contents of the papers filed in two or more files may be identical. The filing of duplicate copies of correspondence in the file of an application, patent, or other proceeding should be avoided, except in situations in which the Office requires the filing of duplicate copies. The Office may dispose of duplicate copies of correspondence in the file of an application, patent, or other proceeding.
- (c) Since different matters may be considered by different branches or sections of the Office, each distinct subject, inquiry or order must be contained in a separate paper to avoid confusion and delay in answering papers dealing with different subjects. Subjects provided for on a single Office or World Intellectual Property Organization form may be contained in a single paper.
- (d)
    
    - (1) _Handwritten signature._ A design patent practitioner must indicate their design patent practitioner status by placing the word "design" (in any format) adjacent to their handwritten signature. Each piece of correspondence, except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2) through (4), (e), and (f) of this section, filed in an application, patent file, or other proceeding in the Office that requires a person’s signature, must:
        - (i) Be an original, that is, have an original handwritten signature personally signed, in permanent dark ink or its equivalent, by that person; or
        - (ii) Be a direct or indirect copy, such as a photocopy or facsimile transmission (§ **[1.6(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e313447.html)** ), of an original. In the event that a copy of the original is filed, the original should be retained as evidence of authenticity. If a question of authenticity arises, the Office may require submission of the original.
    - (2) _S-signature._ An S-signature is a signature inserted between forward slash marks, but not a handwritten signature as defined by paragraph **[(d)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e313174.html)**  of this section. An S-signature includes any signature made by electronic or mechanical means, and any other mode of making or applying a signature other than a handwritten signature as provided for in paragraph **[(d)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e313174.html)**  of this section. Correspondence being filed in the Office in paper, by facsimile transmission as provided in § **[1.6(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e313447.html)**, or via the USPTO patent electronic filing system as an attachment as provided in § **[1.6(a)(4)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e313447.html)**, for a patent application, patent, or a reexamination or supplemental examination proceeding may be S-signature signed instead of being personally signed (_i.e.,_ with a handwritten signature) as provided for in paragraph (d)(1) of this section. The requirements for an S-signature under this paragraph (d)(2) of this section are as follows.
        - (i) The S-signature must consist only of letters, or Arabic numerals, or both, with appropriate spaces and commas, periods, apostrophes, or hyphens for punctuation, and the person signing the correspondence must insert his or her own S-signature with a first single forward slash mark before, and a second single forward slash mark after, the S-signature (_e.g.,_ /Dr. James T. Jones, Jr./); and
        - (ii) A patent practitioner (§ **[1.32(a)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e317381.html)** ), signing pursuant to § **[1.33(b)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e317491.html)**  or **[(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e317491.html)**, must supply their registration number either as part of the S-signature or immediately below or adjacent to the S-signature. The hash (#) character may only be used as part of the S-signature when appearing before a practitioner’s registration number; otherwise, the hash character may not be used in an S-signature. A design patent practitioner must additionally indicate their design patent practitioner status by placing the word "design" (in any format) adjacent to the last forward slash of their S-signature.
        - (iii) The signer’s name must be:
            - (A) Presented in printed or typed form preferably immediately below or adjacent the S-signature, and
            - (B) Reasonably specific enough so that the identity of the signer can be readily recognized.
    
    - (3) _Electronically submitted correspondence._ Correspondence permitted via the USPTO patent electronic filing system may be signed by a graphic representation of a handwritten signature as provided for in paragraph (d)(1) of this section or a graphic representation of an S-signature as provided for in paragraph (d)(2) of this section when it is submitted via the USPTO patent electronic filing system.
    - (4) _Certifications_—
        - (i) _Certification as to the paper presented._ The presentation to the Office (whether by signing, filing, submitting, or later advocating) of any paper by a party, whether a practitioner or non-practitioner, constitutes a certification under § **[11.18(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e351236.html##d0e351251)**  of this subchapter. Violations of § **[11.18(b)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e351236.html##d0e351262)**  of this subchapter by a party, whether a practitioner or non-practitioner, may result in the imposition of sanctions under § **[11.18(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e351236.html##d0e351282)**  of this subchapter. Any practitioner violating § **[11.18(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e351236.html##d0e351251)**  of this subchapter may also be subject to disciplinary action. See § **[11.18(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e351236.html##d0e351306)**  of this subchapter.
        - (ii) _Certification as to the signature._ The person inserting a signature under paragraph (d)(2) or (d)(3) of this section in a document submitted to the Office certifies that the inserted signature appearing in the document is his or her own signature. A person submitting a document signed by another under paragraph (d)(2) or (d)(3) of this section is obligated to have a reasonable basis to believe that the person whose signature is present on the document was actually inserted by that person, and should retain evidence of authenticity of the signature. Violations of the certification as to the signature of another or a person’s own signature as set forth in this paragraph may result in the imposition of sanctions under § **[11.18(c) and (d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e351236.html##d0e351282)**  of this chapter.
    - (5) _Forms._ The Office provides forms for the public to use in certain situations to assist in the filing of correspondence for a certain purpose and to meet certain requirements for patent applications and proceedings. Use of the forms for purposes for which they were not designed is prohibited. No changes to certification statements on the Office forms (_e.g.,_ oath or declaration forms, terminal disclaimer forms, petition forms, and nonpublication request forms) may be made. The existing text of a form, other than a certification statement, may be modified, deleted, or added to, if all text identifying the form as an Office form is removed. The presentation to the Office (whether by signing, filing, submitting, or later advocating) of any Office form with text identifying the form as an Office form by a party, whether a practitioner or non-practitioner, constitutes a certification under § **[11.18(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e351236.html)**  of this chapter that the existing text and any certification statements on the form have not been altered other than permitted by EFS-Web customization.
- (e) [Reserved]
- (f) When a document that is required by statute to be certified must be filed, a copy, including a photocopy or facsimile transmission, of the certification is not acceptable.
- (g) An applicant who has not made of record a registered attorney or agent may be required to state whether assistance was received in the preparation or prosecution of the patent application, for which any compensation or consideration was given or charged, and if so, to disclose the name or names of the person or persons providing such assistance. Assistance includes the preparation for the applicant of the specification and amendments or other papers to be filed in the Patent and Trademark Office, as well as other assistance in such matters, but does not include merely making drawings by draftsmen or stenographic services in typing papers.
- (h) _Ratification/confirmation/evidence of authenticity:_ The Office may require ratification, confirmation (which includes submission of a duplicate document but with a proper signature), or evidence of authenticity of a signature, such as when the Office has reasonable doubt as to the authenticity (veracity) of the signature, _e.g.,_ where there are variations of a signature, or where the signature and the typed or printed name, do not clearly identify the person signing.

# 1.5    Identification of patent, patent application, or patent-related proceeding.

- (a) No correspondence relating to an application should be filed prior to receipt of the assigned application number (_i.e._, U.S. application number, international application number, or international registration number as appropriate). When correspondence directed to the Patent and Trademark Office concerns a previously filed application for a patent, it must identify on the top page in a conspicuous location, the application number (consisting of the series code and the serial number; _e.g._, 07/123,456), or the serial number and filing date assigned to that application by the Patent and Trademark Office, or the international application number of the international application, or the international registration number of an international design application. Any correspondence not containing such identification will be returned to the sender where a return address is available. The returned correspondence will be accompanied with a cover letter, which will indicate to the sender that if the returned correspondence is resubmitted to the Patent and Trademark Office within two weeks of the mail date on the cover letter, the original date of receipt of the correspondence will be considered by the Patent and Trademark Office as the date of receipt of the correspondence. Applicants may use either the Certificate of Mailing or Transmission procedure under § **[1.8](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e313726.html)**  or the Priority Mail Express® procedure under § **[1.10](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e313951.html)**  for resubmissions of returned correspondence if they desire to have the benefit of the date of deposit in the United States Postal Service. If the returned correspondence is not resubmitted within the two-week period, the date of receipt of the resubmission will be considered to be the date of receipt of the correspondence. The two-week period to resubmit the returned correspondence will not be extended. In addition to the application number, all correspondence directed to the Patent and Trademark Office concerning applications for patent should also state the name of the first listed inventor, the title of the invention, the date of filing the same, and if known, the group art unit or other unit within the Patent and Trademark Office responsible for considering the correspondence and the name of the examiner or other person to which it has been assigned.
- (b) When the letter concerns a patent other than for purposes of paying a maintenance fee, it should state the number and date of issue of the patent, the name of the patentee, and the title of the invention. For letters concerning payment of a maintenance fee in a patent, see the provisions of § **[1.366(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e327022.html)**.
- (c) Correspondence relating to a trial proceeding before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (part 42 of this title) are governed by § **[42.6](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//ar_d1d85a_25940_3b6.html)**  of this title.
- (d) A letter relating to a reexamination or supplemental examination proceeding should identify it as such by the number of the patent undergoing reexamination or supplemental examination, the request control number assigned to such proceeding, and, if known, the group art unit and name of the examiner to which it been assigned.
- (e) [Reserved]

# 1.22    Fees payable in advance.

- (a) Patent fees and charges payable to the United States Patent and Trademark Office are required to be paid in advance; that is, at the time of requesting any action by the Office for which a fee or charge is payable with the exception that under § **[1.53](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e318681.html)**  applications for patent may be assigned a filing date without payment of the basic filing fee.
- (b) All fees paid to the United States Patent and Trademark Office must be itemized in each individual application, patent, or other proceeding in such a manner that it is clear for which purpose the fees are paid. The Office may return fees that are not itemized as required by this paragraph. The provisions of § **[1.5(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e313403.html)**  do not apply to the resubmission of fees returned pursuant to this paragraph.

If sent in any other form, the Office may delay or cancel the credit until collection is made. Checks and money orders must be made payable to the Director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office. (Checks made payable to the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks will continue to be accepted.) Payments from foreign countries must be payable and immediately negotiable in the United States for the full amount of the fee required. Money sent to the Office by mail will be at the risk of the sender, and letters containing money should be registered with the United States Postal Service.
- (b) Payments of money required for United States Patent and Trademark Office fees may also be made by credit card, except for replenishing a deposit account. Payment of a fee by credit card must specify the amount to be charged to the credit card and such other information as is necessary to process the charge, and is subject to collection of the fee. The Office will not accept a general authorization to charge fees to a credit card. If credit card information is provided on a form or document other than a form provided by the Office for the payment of fees by credit card, the Office will not be liable if the credit card number becomes public knowledge.
- (c) A fee transmittal letter may be signed by a juristic applicant or patent owner.

# 1.25    Deposit accounts.

- (a) For the convenience of attorneys, and the general public in paying any fees due, in ordering services offered by the Office, copies of records, etc., deposit accounts may be established in the Patent and Trademark Office upon payment of the fee for establishing a deposit account (§ **[1.21(b)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e316474.html)** ). A minimum deposit of $1,000 is required for paying any fee due or in ordering any services offered by the Office. However, a minimum deposit of $300 may be paid to establish a restricted subscription deposit account used exclusively for subscription order of patent copies as issued. At the end of each month, a deposit account statement will be rendered. A remittance must be made promptly upon receipt of the statement to cover the value of items or services charged to the account and thus restore the account to its established normal deposit. An amount sufficient to cover all fees, services, copies, etc., requested must always be on deposit. Charges to accounts with insufficient funds will not be accepted. A service charge (§ **[1.21(b)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e316474.html)** ) will be assessed for each month that the balance at the end of the month is below $1,000.

- (b) Filing, issue, appeal, international-type search report, international application processing, international design application fees, petition, and post-issuance fees may be charged against these accounts if sufficient funds are on deposit to cover such fees. A general authorization to charge all fees, or only certain fees, set forth in §§ **[1.16](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e314702.html)**  through **[1.18](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e315894.html)**  to a deposit account containing sufficient funds may be filed in an individual application, either for the entire pendency of the application or with a particular paper filed.

# 1.26    Refunds.

- (a) The Director may refund any fee paid by mistake or in excess of that required. A change of purpose after the payment of a fee, such as when a party desires to withdraw a patent filing for which the fee was paid, including an application, an appeal, or a request for an oral hearing, will not entitle a party to a refund of such fee. The Office will not refund amounts of twenty-five dollars or less unless a refund is specifically requested, and will not notify the payor of such amounts. If a party paying a fee or requesting a refund does not provide the banking information necessary for making refunds by electronic funds transfer (31 U.S.C. 3332 and 31 CFR part 208), or instruct the Office that refunds are to be credited to a deposit account, the Director may require such information, or use the banking information on the payment instrument to make a refund. Any refund of a fee paid by credit card will be by a credit to the credit card account to which the fee was charged.
- (b) Any request for refund must be filed within two years from the date the fee was paid, except as otherwise provided in this paragraph or in § **[1.28(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e317241.html)**. If the Office charges a deposit account by an amount other than an amount specifically indicated in an authorization (§ **[1.25(b))](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e316815.html)**, any request for refund based upon such charge must be filed within two years from the date of the deposit account statement indicating such charge, and include a copy of that deposit account statement. The time periods set forth in this paragraph are not extendable.
- (c) If the Director decides not to institute a reexamination proceeding in response to a request for reexamination or supplemental examination, fees paid with the request for reexamination or supplemental examination will be refunded or returned in accordance with paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) of this section. The reexamination requester or the patent owner who requested a supplemental examination proceeding, as appropriate, should indicate the form in which any refund should be made (_e.g.,_ by check, electronic funds transfer, credit to a deposit account). Generally, refunds will be issued in the form that the original payment was provided.
    - (1) For an _ex parte_ reexamination request, the _ex parte_ reexamination filing fee paid by the reexamination requester, less the fee set forth in § **[1.20(c)(7)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e316217.html##ar_d20034_1deb4_23)**, will be refunded to the requester if the Director decides not to institute an _ex parte_ reexamination proceeding.
    - (2) For an _inter partes_ reexamination request, a refund of $7,970 will be made to the reexamination requester if the Director decides not to institute an _inter partes_ reexamination proceeding.
    - (3) For a supplemental examination request, the fee for reexamination ordered as a result of supplemental examination, as set forth in § **[1.20(k)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e316217.html##ar_d1d8b7_17396_188)**, will be returned to the patent owner who requested the supplemental examination proceeding if the Director decides not to institute a reexamination proceeding.

    - (5) _Security Interest._ A security interest does not involve an obligation to transfer rights in the invention for the purposes of paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section unless the security interest is defaulted upon.
- (b) _Establishment of small entity status permits payment of reduced fees._
    - (1) A small entity, as defined in paragraph (a) of this section, who has properly asserted entitlement to small entity status pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section will be accorded small entity status by the Office in the particular application or patent in which entitlement to small entity status was asserted. Establishment of small entity status allows the payment of certain reduced patent fees pursuant to **[35 U.S.C. 41(h)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e301581.html)**.
    - (2) Submission of an original utility application in compliance with the USPTO patent electronic filing system by an applicant who has properly asserted entitlement to small entity status pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section in that application allows the payment of a reduced filing fee pursuant to **[35 U.S.C. 41(h)(3)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e301581.html)**.
- (c) _Assertion of small entity status._ Any party (person, small business concern or nonprofit organization) should make a determination, pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section, of entitlement to be accorded small entity status based on the definitions set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, and must, in order to establish small entity status for the purpose of paying small entity fees, actually make an assertion of entitlement to small entity status, in the manner set forth in paragraphs (c)(1) or (c)(3) of this section, in the application or patent in which such small entity fees are to be paid.
    - (1) _Assertion by writing._ Small entity status may be established by a written assertion of entitlement to small entity status. A written assertion must:
        - (i) Be clearly identifiable;
        - (ii) Be signed (see paragraph (c)(2) of this section); and
        - (iii) Convey the concept of entitlement to small entity status, such as by stating that applicant is a small entity, or that small entity status is entitled to be asserted for the application or patent. While no specific words or wording are required to assert small entity status, the intent to assert small entity status must be clearly indicated in order to comply with the assertion requirement.
    - (2) _Parties who can sign the written assertion._ The written assertion can be signed by:
        - (i) The applicant (§ **[1.42](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//aia_d0e317787.html)**  or § **[1.421](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//aia_d0e327684.html)** );
        - (ii) A patent practitioner of record or a practitioner acting in a representative capacity under § **[1.34](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e317605.html)**;
        - (iii) The inventor or a joint inventor, if the inventor is the applicant; or
        - (iv) The assignee.
    - (3) _Assertion by payment of the small entity basic filing, basic transmittal, basic national fee, international search fee, or individual designation fee in an international design application._ The payment, by any party, of the exact amount of one of the small entity basic filing fees set forth in § **[1.16(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e314702.html##d0e314710)**, **[(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e314702.html)**, **[(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e314702.html)**, **[(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e314702.html)**, or **[(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e314702.html)**, the small entity transmittal fee set forth in § **[1.445(a)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e328174.html)**  or § **[1.1031(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//ar_d22557_1eb2e_2ea.html)**, the small entity international search fee set forth in § **[1.445(a)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e328174.html)**  to a Receiving Office other than the United States Receiving Office in the exact amount established for that Receiving Office pursuant to **[PCT Rule 16](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e368100.html)**, or the small entity basic national fee set forth in § **[1.492(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e329162.html)**, will be treated as a written assertion of entitlement to small entity status even if the type of basic filing, basic transmittal, or basic national fee is inadvertently selected in error. The payment, by any party, of the small entity first part of the individual designation fee for the United States to the International Bureau (§ **[1.1031](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//ar_d22557_1eb2e_2ea.html)** ) will be treated as a written assertion of entitlement to small entity status.
        - (i) If the Office accords small entity status based on payment of a small entity basic filing or basic national fee under paragraph (c)(3) of this section that is not applicable to that application, any balance of the small entity fee that is applicable to that application will be due along with the appropriate surcharge set forth in § **[1.16(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e314702.html)**, or § **[1.16(g).](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e314702.html)** 
        - (ii) The payment of any small entity fee other than those set forth in paragraph (c)(3) of this section (whether in the exact fee amount or not) will not be treated as a written assertion of entitlement to small entity status and will not be sufficient to establish small entity status in an application or a patent.
    - (4) _Assertion required in related, continuing, and reissue applications._ Status as a small entity must be specifically established by an assertion in each related, continuing and reissue application in which status is appropriate and desired. Status as a small entity in one application or patent does not affect the status of any other application or patent, regardless of the relationship of the applications or patents. The refiling of an application under § **[1.53](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e318681.html)**  as a continuation, divisional, or continuation-in-part application (including a continued prosecution application under § **[1.53(d))](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e318681.html)**, or the filing of a reissue application, requires a new assertion as to continued entitlement to small entity status for the continuing or reissue application.
- (d) _When small entity fees can be paid._ Any fee, other than the small entity basic filing fees and the small entity national fees of paragraph (c)(3) of this section, can be paid in the small entity amount only if it is submitted with, or subsequent to, the submission of a written assertion of entitlement to small entity status, except when refunds are permitted by § **[1.28(a).](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e317241.html)** 
- (e) _Only one assertion required._
    - (1) An assertion of small entity status need only be filed once in an application or patent. Small entity status, once established, remains in effect until changed pursuant to paragraph (g)(1) of this section. Where an assignment of rights or an obligation to assign rights to other parties who are small entities occurs subsequent to an assertion of small entity status, a second assertion is not required.
    - (2) Once small entity status is withdrawn pursuant to paragraph (g)(2) of this section, a new written assertion is required to again obtain small entity status.
- (f) _Assertion requires a determination of entitlement to pay small entity fees._ Prior to submitting an assertion of entitlement to small entity status in an application, including a related, continuing, or reissue application, a determination of such entitlement should be made pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. It should be determined that all parties holding rights in the invention qualify for small entity status. The Office will generally not question any assertion of small entity status that is made in accordance with the requirements of this section, but note paragraph (h) of this section.
- (g)
    - (1) _New determination of entitlement to small entity status is needed when issue and maintenance fees are due._ Once status as a small entity has been established in an application or patent, fees as a small entity may thereafter be paid in that application or patent without regard to a change in status until the issue fee is due or any maintenance fee is due.
    - (2) _Notification of loss of entitlement to small entity status is required when issue and maintenance fees are due._ Notification of a loss of entitlement to small entity status must be filed in the application or patent prior to paying, or at the time of paying, the earliest of the issue fee or any maintenance fee due after the date on which status as a small entity as defined in paragraph (a) of this section is no longer appropriate. The notification that small entity status is no longer appropriate must be signed by a party identified in § **[1.33(b).](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e317491.html)**  Payment of a fee in other than the small entity amount is not sufficient notification that small entity status is no longer appropriate.
- (h) _Fraud attempted or practiced on the Office._
    - (1) Any attempt to fraudulently establish status as a small entity, or pay fees as a small entity, shall be considered as a fraud practiced or attempted on the Office.
    - (2) Improperly, and with intent to deceive, establishing status as a small entity, or paying fees as a small entity, shall be considered as a fraud practiced or attempted on the Office.

    - (5) _Security Interest._ A security interest does not involve an obligation to transfer rights in the invention for the purposes of paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section unless the security interest is defaulted upon.
- (b) _Establishment of small entity status permits payment of reduced fees._
    - (1) A small entity, as defined in paragraph (a) of this section, who has properly asserted entitlement to small entity status pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section will be accorded small entity status by the Office in the particular application or patent in which entitlement to small entity status was asserted. Establishment of small entity status allows the payment of certain reduced patent fees pursuant to **[35 U.S.C. 41(h)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e301581.html)**.
    - (2) Submission of an original utility application in compliance with the Office electronic filing system by an applicant who has properly asserted entitlement to small entity status pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section in that application allows the payment of a reduced filing fee pursuant to **[35 U.S.C. 41(h)(3)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e301581.html)**.
- (c) _Assertion of small entity status._ Any party (person, small business concern or nonprofit organization) should make a determination, pursuant to paragraph (f) of this section, of entitlement to be accorded small entity status based on the definitions set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, and must, in order to establish small entity status for the purpose of paying small entity fees, actually make an assertion of entitlement to small entity status, in the manner set forth in paragraphs (c)(1) or (c)(3) of this section, in the application or patent in which such small entity fees are to be paid.
    - (1) _Assertion by writing._ Small entity status may be established by a written assertion of entitlement to small entity status. A written assertion must:
        - (i) Be clearly identifiable;
        - (ii) Be signed (see paragraph (c)(2) of this section); and
        - (iii) Convey the concept of entitlement to small entity status, such as by stating that applicant is a small entity, or that small entity status is entitled to be asserted for the application or patent. While no specific words or wording are required to assert small entity status, the intent to assert small entity status must be clearly indicated in order to comply with the assertion requirement.
    - (2) _Parties who can sign and file the written assertion._ The written assertion can be signed by:
        - (i) One of the parties identified in § **[1.33(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e317491.html)**  (_e.g.,_ an attorney or agent registered with the Office), § **[3.73(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e336732.html)**  of this chapter notwithstanding, who can also file the written assertion;
        - (ii) At least one of the individuals identified as an inventor (even though a § **[1.63](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e319759.html)**  executed oath or declaration has not been submitted), notwithstanding § **[1.33(b)(4)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e317491.html)**, who can also file the written assertion pursuant to the exception under § **[1.33(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e317491.html)**  of this part; or
        - (iii) An assignee of an undivided part interest, notwithstanding §§ **[1.33(b)(3)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e317491.html)**  and **[3.73(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e336732.html)**  of this chapter, but the partial assignee cannot file the assertion without resort to a party identified under § **[1.33(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e317491.html)**  of this part.
    - (3) _Assertion by payment of the small entity basic filing or basic national fee._ The payment, by any party, of the exact amount of one of the small entity basic filing fees set forth in §§ **[1.16(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e314702.html)**, **[1.16(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e314702.html)**, **[1.16(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e314702.html)**, **[1.16(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e314702.html)**, **[1.16(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e314702.html)**, or the small entity basic national fee set forth in § **[1.492(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e329162.html)**, will be treated as a written assertion of entitlement to small entity status even if the type of basic filing or basic national fee is inadvertently selected in error.
        - (i) If the Office accords small entity status based on payment of a small entity basic filing or basic national fee under paragraph (c)(3) of this section that is not applicable to that application, any balance of the small entity fee that is applicable to that application will be due along with the appropriate surcharge set forth in § **[1.16(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e314702.html)**, or § **[1.16(g).](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e314702.html)** 
        - (ii) The payment of any small entity fee other than those set forth in paragraph (c)(3) of this section (whether in the exact fee amount or not) will not be treated as a written assertion of entitlement to small entity status and will not be sufficient to establish small entity status in an application or a patent.
    - (4) _Assertion required in related, continuing, and reissue applications._ Status as a small entity must be specifically established by an assertion in each related, continuing and reissue application in which status is appropriate and desired. Status as a small entity in one application or patent does not affect the status of any other application or patent, regardless of the relationship of the applications or patents. The refiling of an application under § **[1.53](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e318681.html)**  as a continuation, divisional, or continuation-in-part application (including a continued prosecution application under § **[1.53(d))](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e318681.html)**, or the filing of a reissue application, requires a new assertion as to continued entitlement to small entity status for the continuing or reissue application.
- (d) _When small entity fees can be paid._ Any fee, other than the small entity basic filing fees and the small entity national fees of paragraph (c)(3) of this section, can be paid in the small entity amount only if it is submitted with, or subsequent to, the submission of a written assertion of entitlement to small entity status, except when refunds are permitted by § **[1.28(a).](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e317241.html)** 
- (e) _Only one assertion required._
    - (1) An assertion of small entity status need only be filed once in an application or patent. Small entity status, once established, remains in effect until changed pursuant to paragraph (g)(1) of this section. Where an assignment of rights or an obligation to assign rights to other parties who are small entities occurs subsequent to an assertion of small entity status, a second assertion is not required.
    - (2) Once small entity status is withdrawn pursuant to paragraph (g)(2) of this section, a new written assertion is required to again obtain small entity status.
- (f) _Assertion requires a determination of entitlement to pay small entity fees._ Prior to submitting an assertion of entitlement to small entity status in an application, including a related, continuing, or reissue application, a determination of such entitlement should be made pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section. It should be determined that all parties holding rights in the invention qualify for small entity status. The Office will generally not question any assertion of small entity status that is made in accordance with the requirements of this section, but note paragraph (h) of this section.
- (g)
    - (1) _New determination of entitlement to small entity status is needed when issue and maintenance fees are due._ Once status as a small entity has been established in an application or patent, fees as a small entity may thereafter be paid in that application or patent without regard to a change in status until the issue fee is due or any maintenance fee is due.
    - (2) _Notification of loss of entitlement to small entity status is required when issue and maintenance fees are due._ Notification of a loss of entitlement to small entity status must be filed in the application or patent prior to paying, or at the time of paying, the earliest of the issue fee or any maintenance fee due after the date on which status as a small entity as defined in paragraph (a) of this section is no longer appropriate. The notification that small entity status is no longer appropriate must be signed by a party identified in § **[1.33(b).](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e317491.html)**  Payment of a fee in other than the small entity amount is not sufficient notification that small entity status is no longer appropriate.
- (h) _Fraud attempted or practiced on the Office._
    - (1) Any attempt to fraudulently establish status as a small entity, or pay fees as a small entity, shall be considered as a fraud practiced or attempted on the Office.
    - (2) Improperly, and with intent to deceive, establishing status as a small entity, or paying fees as a small entity, shall be considered as a fraud practiced or attempted on the Office.

# 1.28    Refunds when small entity status is later established; how errors in small entity status are excused.

- (a) _Refunds based on later establishment of small entity status._ A refund pursuant to § **[1.26](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e316905.html)**, based on establishment of small entity status, of a portion of fees timely paid in full prior to establishing status as a small entity may only be obtained if an assertion under § **[1.27(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//aia_d0e316949.html)**  and a request for a refund of the excess amount are filed within three months of the date of the timely payment of the full fee. The three-month time period is not extendable under § **[1.136](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e323655.html)**. Status as a small entity is waived for any fee by the failure to establish the status prior to paying, at the time of paying, or within three months of the date of payment of, the full fee.
- (b) _Date of payment._
    - (1) The three-month period for requesting a refund, pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, starts on the date that a full fee has been paid;
    - (2) The date when a deficiency payment is paid in full determines the amount of deficiency that is due, pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section.
- (c) _How errors in small entity status are excused._ If status as a small entity is established in good faith, and fees as a small entity are paid in good faith, in any application or patent, and it is later discovered that such status as a small entity was established in error, or that through error the Office was not notified of a loss of entitlement to small entity status as required by § **[1.27(g)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//aia_d0e316949.html)**, the error will be excused upon: compliance with the separate submission and itemization requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section, and the deficiency payment requirement of paragraph (c)(2) of this section:
    - (1) _Separate submission required for each application or patent._ Any paper submitted under this paragraph must be limited to the deficiency payment (all fees paid in error), required by paragraph (c)(2) of this section, for one application or one patent. Where more than one application or patent is involved, separate submissions of deficiency payments (_e.g.,_ checks) and itemizations are required for each application or patent. See § **[1.4(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e313174.html)**.
    - (2) _Payment of deficiency owed._ The deficiency owed, resulting from the previous erroneous payment of small entity fees, must be paid.
        - (i) _Calculation of the deficiency owed._ The deficiency owed for each previous fee erroneously paid as a small entity is the difference between the current fee amount (for other than a small entity) on the date the deficiency is paid in full and the amount of the previous erroneous (small entity) fee payment. The total deficiency payment owed is the sum of the individual deficiency owed amounts for each fee amount previously erroneously paid as a small entity. Where a fee paid in error as a small entity was subject to a fee decrease between the time the fee was paid in error and the time the deficiency is paid in full, the deficiency owed is equal to the amount (previously) paid in error;
        - (ii) _Itemization of the deficiency payment._ An itemization of the total deficiency payment is required. The itemization must include the following information:
            - (A) Each particular type of fee that was erroneously paid as a small entity, (_e.g.,_ basic statutory filing fee, two-month extension of time fee) along with the current fee amount for a non-small entity;
            - (B) The small entity fee actually paid, and when. This will permit the Office to differentiate, for example, between two one-month extension of time fees erroneously paid as a small entity but on different dates;
            - (C) The deficiency owed amount (for each fee erroneously paid); and
            - (D) The total deficiency payment owed, which is the sum or total of the individual deficiency owed amounts set forth in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(C) of this section.
    - (3) _Failure to comply with requirements._ If the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section are not complied with, such failure will either: be treated as an authorization for the Office to process the deficiency payment and charge the processing fee set forth in § **[1.17(i)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//eff_20130320_d0e315199.html)**, or result in a requirement for compliance within a one-month non-extendable time period under § **[1.136(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e323655.html##d0e323663)**  to avoid the return of the fee deficiency paper, at the option of the Office.
- (d) _Payment of deficiency operates as notification of loss of status._ Any deficiency payment (based on a previous erroneous payment of a small entity fee) submitted under paragraph (c) of this section will be treated under § **[1.27(g)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//aia_d0e316949.html)**  as a notification of a loss of entitlement to small entity status.

# 1.29    Micro entity status.

- (a) To establish micro entity status under this paragraph, the applicant must certify that:
    - (1) The applicant qualifies as a small entity as defined in § **[1.27](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//aia_d0e316949.html)**  without relying on a government use license exception under § **[1.27(a)(4)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//aia_d0e316949.html##aia_d0e317024)**;
    - (2) Neither the applicant nor the inventor nor a joint inventor has been named as the inventor or a joint inventor on more than four previously filed patent applications, other than applications filed in another country, provisional applications under **[35 U.S.C. 111(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//pltd0e302673aia.html##pltd0e302719ala)**, or international applications for which the basic national fee under **[35 U.S.C. 41(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e301581.html##d0e301593)**  was not paid;
    - (3) Neither the applicant nor the inventor nor a joint inventor, in the calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the applicable fee is being paid, had a gross income, as defined in section 61(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 61(a)), exceeding three times the median household income for that preceding calendar year, as most recently reported by the Bureau of the Census; and
    - (4) Neither the applicant nor the inventor nor a joint inventor has assigned, granted, or conveyed, nor is under an obligation by contract or law to assign, grant, or convey, a license or other ownership interest in the application concerned to an entity that, in the calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the applicable fee is being paid, had a gross income, as defined in section 61(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, exceeding three times the median household income for that preceding calendar year, as most recently reported by the Bureau of the Census.
- (b) An applicant, inventor, or joint inventor is not considered to be named on a previously filed application for purposes of paragraph (a)(2) of this section if the applicant, inventor, or joint inventor has assigned, or is under an obligation by contract or law to assign, all ownership rights in the application as the result of the applicant’s, inventor’s, or joint inventor’s previous employment.
- (c) If an applicant’s, inventor’s, joint inventor’s, or entity’s gross income in the preceding calendar year is not in United States dollars, the average currency exchange rate, as reported by the Internal Revenue Service, during that calendar year shall be used to determine whether the applicant’s, inventor’s, joint inventor’s, or entity’s gross income exceeds the threshold specified in paragraph (a)(3) or (4) of this section.
- (d) To establish micro entity status under this paragraph, the applicant must certify that:
    - (1) The applicant qualifies as a small entity as defined in § **[1.27](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//aia_d0e316949.html)**  without relying on a government use license exception under § **[1.27(a)(4)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//aia_d0e316949.html##aia_d0e317024)**; and
    - (2)
        - (i) The applicant’s employer, from which the applicant obtains the majority of the applicant’s income, is an institution of higher education as defined in section 101(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1001(a)); or
        - (ii) The applicant has assigned, granted, conveyed, or is under an obligation by contract or law, to assign, grant, or convey, a license or other ownership interest in the particular application to such an institution of higher education.
- (e) Micro entity status is established in an application by filing a micro entity certification in writing complying with the requirements of either paragraph (a) or (d) of this section and signed either in compliance with § **[1.33(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//aia_d0e317491.html##aia_d0e317540)**, in an international application filed in a Receiving Office other than the United States Receiving Office by a person authorized to represent the applicant under § **[1.455](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e328435.html)**  , or in an international design application by a person authorized to represent the applicant under § **[1.1041](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//ar_d22557_1fd89_6.html)**  before the International Bureau where the micro entity certification is filed with the International Bureau. Status as a micro entity must be specifically established in each related, continuing and reissue application in which status is appropriate and desired. Status as a micro entity in one application or patent does not affect the status of any other application or patent, regardless of the relationship of the applications or patents. The refiling of an application under § **[1.53](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//aia_d0e318681.html)**  as a continuation, divisional, or continuation-in-part application (including a continued prosecution application under § **[1.53(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//aia_d0e318681.html)** ), or the filing of a reissue application, requires a new certification of entitlement to micro entity status for the continuing or reissue application.
- (f) A fee may be paid in the micro entity amount only if it is submitted with, or subsequent to, the submission of a certification of entitlement to micro entity status.
- (g) A certification of entitlement to micro entity status need only be filed once in an application or patent. Micro entity status, once established, remains in effect until changed pursuant to paragraph (i) of this section. However, a fee may be paid in the micro entity amount only if status as a micro entity as defined in paragraph (a) or (d) of this section is appropriate on the date the fee is being paid. Where an assignment of rights or an obligation to assign rights to other parties who are micro entities occurs subsequent to the filing of a certification of entitlement to micro entity status, a second certification of entitlement to micro entity status is not required.
- (h) Prior to submitting a certification of entitlement to micro entity status in an application, including a related, continuing, or reissue application, a determination of such entitlement should be made pursuant to the requirements of this section. It should be determined that each applicant qualifies for micro entity status under paragraph (a) or (d) of this section, and that any other party holding rights in the invention qualifies for small entity status under **[§ 1.27](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//aia_d0e316949.html)**. The Office will generally not question certification of entitlement to micro entity status that is made in accordance with the requirements of this section.
- (i) Notification of a loss of entitlement to micro entity status must be filed in the application or patent prior to paying, or at the time of paying, any fee after the date on which status as a micro entity as defined in paragraph (a) or (d) of this section is no longer appropriate. The notification that micro entity status is no longer appropriate must be signed by a party identified in § **[1.33(b).](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//aia_d0e317491.html##aia_d0e317540)**  Payment of a fee in other than the micro entity amount is not sufficient notification that micro entity status is no longer appropriate. A notification that micro entity status is no longer appropriate will not be treated as a notification that small entity status is also no longer appropriate unless it also contains a notification of loss of entitlement to small entity status under § 1.27(f)(2)[**[1.27(g)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//aia_d0e316949.html##aia_d0e317215)** ]. Once a notification of a loss of entitlement to micro entity status is filed in the application or patent, a new certification of entitlement to micro entity status is required to again obtain micro entity status.
- (j) Any attempt to fraudulently establish status as a micro entity, or pay fees as a micro entity, shall be considered as a fraud practiced or attempted on the Office. Improperly, and with intent to deceive, establishing status as a micro entity, or paying fees as a micro entity, shall be considered as a fraud practiced or attempted on the Office.
- (k) If status as a micro entity is established in good faith in an application or patent, and fees as a micro entity are paid in good faith in the application or patent, and it is later discovered that such micro entity status either was established in error, or that the Office was not notified of a loss of entitlement to micro entity status as required by paragraph (i) of this section through error, the error will be excused upon compliance with the separate submission and itemization requirements of paragraph (k)(1) of this section and the deficiency payment requirement of paragraph (k)(2) of this section.
    - (1) Any paper submitted under this paragraph must be limited to the deficiency payment (all fees paid in error) required for a single application or patent. Where more than one application or patent is involved, separate submissions of deficiency payments are required for each application or patent (see § **[1.4(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e313174.html##d0e313230)** ). The paper must contain an itemization of the total deficiency payment for the single application or patent and include the following information:
        - (i) Each particular type of fee that was erroneously paid as a micro entity, (_e.g.,_ basic statutory filing fee, two-month extension of time fee) along with the current fee amount for a small or non-small entity, as applicable;
        - (ii) The micro entity fee actually paid, and the date on which it was paid;
        - (iii) The deficiency owed amount (for each fee erroneously paid); and
        - (iv) The total deficiency payment owed, which is the sum or total of the individual deficiency owed amounts as set forth in paragraph (k)(2) of this section.
    - (2) The deficiency owed, resulting from the previous erroneous payment of micro entity fees, must be paid. The deficiency owed for each previous fee erroneously paid as a micro entity is the difference between the current fee amount for a small entity or non-small entity, as applicable, on the date the deficiency is paid in full and the amount of the previous erroneous micro entity fee payment. The total deficiency payment owed is the sum of the individual deficiency owed amounts for each fee amount previously and erroneously paid as a micro entity.
    - (3) If the requirements of paragraphs (k)(1) and (2) of this section are not complied with, such failure will either be treated at the option of the Office as an authorization for the Office to process the deficiency payment and charge the processing fee set forth in § **[1.17(i)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//eff_20130320_d0e315199.html)**, or result in a requirement for compliance within a one-month time period that is not extendable under § **[1.136(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e323655.html##d0e323663)**  to avoid the return of the fee deficiency payment.
    - (4) Any deficiency payment (based on a previous erroneous payment of a micro entity fee) submitted under this paragraph will be treated as a notification of a loss of entitlement to micro entity status under paragraph (i) of this section.

Double correspondence with the patent owner or owners and the patent owner’s attorney or agent, or with more than one attorney or agent, will not be undertaken.
- (d) A "correspondence address" or change thereto may be filed with the Patent and Trademark Office during the enforceable life of the patent. The "correspondence address" will be used in any correspondence relating to maintenance fees unless a separate "fee address" has been specified. See § **[1.363](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e326984.html)**  for "fee address" used solely for maintenance fee purposes.
- (e) A change of address filed in a patent application or patent does not change the address for a patent practitioner in the roster of patent attorneys and agents. See § **[11.11](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e350949.html)**  of this title.
- (f) Where application papers from a prior application are used in a continuing application and the correspondence address was changed during the prosecution of the prior application, an application data sheet or separate paper identifying the correspondence address to be used for the continuing application must be submitted.

- (a) _Correspondence address and daytime telephone number._ When filing an application, a correspondence address must be set forth in either an application data sheet (§ **[1.76](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e320348.html)**  ), or elsewhere, in a clearly identifiable manner, in any paper submitted with an application filing. If no correspondence address is specified, the Office may treat the mailing address of the first named inventor (if provided, see §§ **[1.76(b)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e320348.html)**  and **[1.63(c)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e319759.html)** ) as the correspondence address. The Office will direct, or otherwise make available, all notices, official letters, and other communications relating to the application to the person associated with the correspondence address. For correspondence submitted via the Office’s electronic filing system, however, an electronic acknowledgment receipt will be sent to the submitter. The Office will generally not engage in double correspondence with an applicant and a patent practitioner, or with more than one patent practitioner except as deemed necessary by the Director. If more than one correspondence address is specified in a single document, the Office will select one of the specified addresses for use as the correspondence address and, if given, will select the address associated with a Customer Number over a typed correspondence address. For the party to whom correspondence is to be addressed, a daytime telephone number should be supplied in a clearly identifiable manner and may be changed by any party who may change the correspondence address. The correspondence address may be changed as follows:
    - (1) _Prior to filing of § 1.63 oath or declaration by any of the inventors._ If a § **[1.63](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e319759.html)**  oath or declaration has not been filed by any of the inventors, the correspondence address may be changed by the party who filed the application. If the application was filed by a patent practitioner, any other patent practitioner named in the transmittal papers may also change the correspondence address. Thus, the inventor(s), any patent practitioner named in the transmittal papers accompanying the original application, or a party that will be the assignee who filed the application, may change the correspondence address in that application under this paragraph.
    - (2) _Where a § 1.63 oath or declaration has been filed by any of the inventors._ If a § **[1.63](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e319759.html)**  oath or declaration has been filed, or is filed concurrent with the filing of an application, by any of the inventors, the correspondence address may be changed by the parties set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, except for paragraph (b)(2).
- (b) __Amendments and other papers.__ Amendments and other papers, except for written assertions pursuant to § **[1.27(c)(2)(ii)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//aia_d0e316949.html)**  of this part, filed in the application must be signed by:
    - (1) A patent practitioner of record appointed in compliance with § **[1.32(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e317381.html)**;

# 1.34    Acting in a representative capacity.

When a patent practitioner acting in a representative capacity appears in person or signs a paper in practice before the United States Patent and Trademark Office in a patent case, his or her personal appearance or signature shall constitute a representation to the United States Patent and Trademark Office that under the provisions of this subchapter and the law, he or she is authorized to represent the particular party on whose behalf he or she acts. In filing such a paper, the patent practitioner must set forth his or her registration number, his or her name and signature. Further proof of authority to act in a representative capacity may be required.

# 1.53    Application number, filing date, and completion of application.

[Editor Note: Applicable to patent applications filed under **[35 U.S.C. 111](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//pltd0e302673aia.html)**  on or after December 18, 2013. See * below for additional applicability notes.]

- (a) _Application number._ Any papers received in the Patent and Trademark Office which purport to be an application for a patent will be assigned an application number for identification purposes.
- (b) _Application filing requirements— Nonprovisional application._ The filing date of an application for patent filed under this section, other than an application for a design patent or a provisional application under paragraph (c) of this section, is the date on which a specification, with or without claims, is received in the Office. The filing date of an application for a design patent filed under this section, except for a continued prosecution application under paragraph (d) of this section, is the date on which the specification as prescribed by **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e302824.html)**, including at least one claim, and any required drawings are received in the Office. No new matter may be introduced into an application after its filing date. A continuing application, which may be a continuation, divisional, or continuation-in-part application, may be filed under the conditions specified in **[35 U.S.C. 120](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e303023313.html)**, **[121](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e303040.html)**, **[365(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e307034.html)**, or **[386(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//al_d225a2_27b56_2ab.html##al_d225a2_29a9c_1b3)**  and § **[1.78](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//aia_d0e320662.html)**.
    - (1) A continuation or divisional application that names as inventors the same or fewer than all of the inventors named in the prior application may be filed under this paragraph or paragraph (d) of this section.
    - (2) A continuation-in-part application (which may disclose and claim subject matter not disclosed in the prior application) or a continuation or divisional application naming an inventor not named in the prior application must be filed under this paragraph.
- (c) _Application filing requirements — Provisional application._ The filing date of a provisional application is the date on which a specification, with or without claims, is received in the Office. No amendment, other than to make the provisional application comply with the patent statute and all applicable regulations, may be made to the provisional application after the filing date of the provisional application.
    - (1) A provisional application must also include the cover sheet required by § **[1.51(c)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e318179.html)**, which may be an application data sheet (§ **[1.76](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e320348.html)** ), or a cover letter identifying the application as a provisional application. Otherwise, the application will be treated as an application filed under paragraph (b) of this section.
    - (2) An application for patent filed under paragraph (b) of this section may be converted to a provisional application and be accorded the original filing date of the application filed under paragraph (b) of this section. The grant of such a request for conversion will not entitle applicant to a refund of the fees that were properly paid in the application filed under paragraph (b) of this section. Such a request for conversion must be accompanied by the processing fee set forth in § **[1.17(q)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//eff_20130320_d0e315199.html)**  and be filed prior to the earliest of:
        - (i) Abandonment of the application filed under paragraph (b) of this section;
        - (ii) Payment of the issue fee on the application filed under paragraph (b) of this section; or
        - (iii) Expiration of twelve months after the filing date of the application filed under paragraph (b) of this section.
    - (3) A provisional application filed under paragraph (c) of this section may be converted to a nonprovisional application filed under paragraph (b) of this section and accorded the original filing date of the provisional application. The conversion of a provisional application to a nonprovisional application will not result in either the refund of any fee properly paid in the provisional application or the application of any such fee to the filing fee, or any other fee, for the nonprovisional application. Conversion of a provisional application to a nonprovisional application under this paragraph will result in the term of any patent to issue from the application being measured from at least the filing date of the provisional application for which conversion is requested. Thus, applicants should consider avoiding this adverse patent term impact by filing a nonprovisional application claiming the benefit of the provisional application under **[35 U.S.C. 119(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e302921.html##d0e302951)**, rather than converting the provisional application into a nonprovisional application pursuant to this paragraph. A request to convert a provisional application to a nonprovisional application must be accompanied by the fee set forth in § **[1.17(i)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//eff_20130320_d0e315199.html)**  and an amendment including at least one claim as prescribed by **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)**, unless the provisional application under paragraph (c) of this section otherwise contains at least one claim as prescribed by **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)**. The nonprovisional application resulting from conversion of a provisional application must also include the filing fee, search fee, and examination fee for a nonprovisional application, and the surcharge required by § **[1.16(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e314702.html##d0e314915)**  if either the basic filing fee for a nonprovisional application or the inventor’s oath or declaration was not present on the filing date accorded the resulting nonprovisional application (_i.e.,_ the filing date of the original provisional application). A request to convert a provisional application to a nonprovisional application must also be filed prior to the earliest of:
        - (i) Abandonment of the provisional application filed under paragraph (c) of this section; or
        - (ii) Expiration of twelve months after the filing date of the provisional application filed under paragraph (c) of this section.
    - (4) A provisional application is not entitled to the right of priority under **[35 U.S.C. 119](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e302921.html)**, **[365(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e307034.html)**, or **[386(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//al_d225a2_27b56_2ab.html##al_d225a2_29a27_324)**  or § **[1.55](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//plt_d0e319215.html)**, or to the benefit of an earlier filing date under **[35 U.S.C. 120](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e303023313.html)**, **[121](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e303040.html)**, **[365(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e307034.html)**, or **[386(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//al_d225a2_27b56_2ab.html##al_d225a2_29a9c_1b3)**  or § **[1.78](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//aia_d0e320662.html)**   of any other application. No claim for priority under **[35 U.S.C. 119(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e302921.html)**  or § **[1.78(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//aia_d0e320662.html)**  may be made in a design application based on a provisional application. A provisional application disclosing nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences is not required to include a separate sequence listing; however, if submitted in a provisional application filed on or after July 1, 2022, any submission of nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence data must be by way of a "Sequence Listing XML" in compliance with §§ **[1.831](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//ar_d35d57_1bdc8_2b8.html)**  through **[1.834](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//ar_d35d57_1be3b_1cf.html)**.
- (d) _Application filing requirements — Continued prosecution (nonprovisional) application._
    - (1) A continuation or divisional application (but not a continuation-in-part) of a prior nonprovisional application may be filed as a continued prosecution application under this paragraph, provided that:
        - (i) The application is for a design patent;
        - (ii) The prior nonprovisional application is a design application, but not an international design application, that is complete as defined by § **[1.51(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e318179.html)**, except for the inventor’s oath or declaration if the application is filed on or after September 16, 2012, and the prior nonprovisional application contains an application data sheet meeting the conditions specified in § **[1.53(f)(3)(i)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//aia_d0e318681.html##ar_d1d8b1_212aa_46)**; and
        - (iii) The application under this paragraph is filed before the earliest of:
            - (A) Payment of the issue fee on the prior application, unless a petition under § **[1.313(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e326317.html)**  is granted in the prior application;
            - (B) Abandonment of the prior application; or
            - (C) Termination of proceedings on the prior application.
    - (2) The filing date of a continued prosecution application is the date on which a request on a separate paper for an application under this paragraph is filed. An application filed under this paragraph:
        - (i) Must identify the prior application;
        - (ii) Discloses and claims only subject matter disclosed in the prior application;
        - (iii) Names as inventors the same inventors named in the prior application on the date the application under this paragraph was filed, except as provided in paragraph (d)(4) of this section;
        - (iv) Includes the request for an application under this paragraph, will utilize the file jacket and contents of the prior application, including the specification, drawings and the inventor’s oath or declaration from the prior application, to constitute the new application, and will be assigned the application number of the prior application for identification purposes; and
        - (v) Is a request to expressly abandon the prior application as of the filing date of the request for an application under this paragraph.
    - (3) The filing fee, search fee, and examination fee for a continued prosecution application filed under this paragraph are the basic filing fee as set forth in § **[1.16(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e314702.html)**, the search fee as set forth in § **[1.16(l)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e314702.html)**, and the examination fee as set forth in § **[1.16(p)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e314702.html)**.
    - (4) An application filed under this paragraph may be filed by fewer than all the inventors named in the prior application, provided that the request for an application under this paragraph when filed is accompanied by a statement requesting deletion of the name or names of the person or persons who are not inventors of the invention being claimed in the new application. No person may be named as an inventor in an application filed under this paragraph who was not named as an inventor in the prior application on the date the application under this paragraph was filed, except by way of correction of inventorship under § **[1.48](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e317930.html)**.
    - (5) Any new change must be made in the form of an amendment to the prior application as it existed prior to the filing of an application under this paragraph. No amendment in an application under this paragraph (a continued prosecution application) may introduce new matter or matter that would have been new matter in the prior application. Any new specification filed with the request for an application under this paragraph will not be considered part of the original application papers, but will be treated as a substitute specification in accordance with § **[1.125](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e323278.html)**.
    - (6) The filing of a continued prosecution application under this paragraph will be construed to include a waiver of confidentiality by the applicant under **[35 U.S.C. 122](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e303054.html)**  to the extent that any member of the public, who is entitled under the provisions of § **[1.14](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e314245.html)**  to access to, copies of, or information concerning either the prior application or any continuing application filed under the provisions of this paragraph, may be given similar access to, copies of, or similar information concerning the other application or applications in the file jacket.
    - (7) A request for an application under this paragraph is the specific reference required by **[35 U.S.C. 120](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e303023313.html)**  to every application assigned the application number identified in such request. No amendment in an application under this paragraph may delete this specific reference to any prior application.
    - (8) In addition to identifying the application number of the prior application, applicant should furnish in the request for an application under this paragraph the following information relating to the prior application to the best of his or her ability:
        - (i) Title of invention;
        - (ii) Name of applicant(s); and
        - (iii) Correspondence address.
    - (9) See § **[1.103(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e321982.html)**  for requesting a limited suspension of action in an application filed under this paragraph.
- (e) _Failure to meet filing date requirements._
    - (1) If an application deposited under paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of this section does not meet the requirements of such paragraph to be entitled to a filing date, applicant will be so notified, if a correspondence address has been provided, and given a period of time within which to correct the filing error. If, however, a request for an application under paragraph (d) of this section does not meet the requirements of that paragraph because the application in which the request was filed is not a design application, and if the application in which the request was filed was itself filed on or after June 8, 1995, the request for an application under paragraph (d) of this section will be treated as a request for continued examination under § **[1.114](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e322625.html)**.
    - (2) Any request for review of a notification pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section, or a notification that the original application papers lack a portion of the specification or drawing(s), must be by way of a petition pursuant to this paragraph accompanied by the fee set forth in § **[1.17(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//eff_20130320_d0e315199.html)**. In the absence of a timely (§ **[1.181(f))](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e324913.html)**  petition pursuant to this paragraph, the filing date of an application in which the applicant was notified of a filing error pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section will be the date the filing error is corrected.
    - (3) If an applicant is notified of a filing error pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section, but fails to correct the filing error within the given time period or otherwise timely (§ **[1.181(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e324913.html)** ) take action pursuant to this paragraph, proceedings in the application will be considered terminated.

- (b) _Application filing requirements — Nonprovisional application._ The filing date of an application for patent filed under this section, except for a provisional application under paragraph (c) of this section or a continued prosecution application under paragraph (d) of this section, is the date on which a specification as prescribed by **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e302824.html)**  containing a description pursuant to § **[1.71](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e320131.html)**  and at least one claim pursuant to § **[1.75](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e320269.html)**, and any drawing required by § **[1.81(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e320940.html)**  are filed in the Patent and Trademark Office. No new matter may be introduced into an application after its filing date. A continuing application, which may be a continuation, divisional, or continuation-in-part application, may be filed under the conditions specified in **[35 U.S.C. 120](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e303023313.html)**, **[121](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e303040.html)**  or **[365(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e307034.html)**  and § **[1.78(c) and (d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//aia_d0e320662.html)**.
    - (1) A continuation or divisional application that names as inventors the same or fewer than all of the inventors named in the prior application may be filed under this paragraph or paragraph (d) of this section.
    - (2) A continuation-in-part application (which may disclose and claim subject matter not disclosed in the prior application) or a continuation or divisional application naming an inventor not named in the prior application must be filed under this paragraph.
- (c) _Application filing requirements — Provisional application._ The filing date of a provisional application is the date on which a specification as prescribed by **[35 U.S.C. 112(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae60_3d5)**, and any drawing required by § **[1.81(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e320940.html)**  are filed in the Patent and Trademark Office. No amendment, other than to make the provisional application comply with the patent statute and all applicable regulations, may be made to the provisional application after the filing date of the provisional application.
    - (1) A provisional application must also include the cover sheet required by § **[1.51(c)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e318179.html)**, which may be an application data sheet (§ **[1.76](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e320348.html)** ), or a cover letter identifying the application as a provisional application. Otherwise, the application will be treated as an application filed under paragraph (b) of this section.
    - (2) An application for patent filed under paragraph (b) of this section may be converted to a provisional application and be accorded the original filing date of the application filed under paragraph (b) of this section. The grant of such a request for conversion will not entitle applicant to a refund of the fees that were properly paid in the application filed under paragraph (b) of this section. Such a request for conversion must be accompanied by the processing fee set forth in § **[1.17(q)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//eff_20130320_d0e315199.html)**  and be filed prior to the earliest of:
        - (i) Abandonment of the application filed under paragraph (b) of this section;
        - (ii) Payment of the issue fee on the application filed under paragraph (b) of this section; or
        - (iii) Expiration of twelve months after the filing date of the application filed under paragraph (b) of this section.
    - (3) A provisional application filed under paragraph (c) of this section may be converted to a nonprovisional application filed under paragraph (b) of this section and accorded the original filing date of the provisional application. The conversion of a provisional application to a nonprovisional application will not result in either the refund of any fee properly paid in the provisional application or the application of any such fee to the filing fee, or any other fee, for the nonprovisional application. Conversion of a provisional application to a nonprovisional application under this paragraph will result in the term of any patent to issue from the application being measured from at least the filing date of the provisional application for which conversion is requested. Thus, applicants should consider avoiding this adverse patent term impact by filing a nonprovisional application claiming the benefit of the provisional application under **[35 U.S.C. 119(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e302921.html##d0e302951)**  (rather than converting the provisional application into a nonprovisional application pursuant to this paragraph). A request to convert a provisional application to a nonprovisional application must be accompanied by the fee set forth in § **[1.17(i)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//eff_20130320_d0e315199.html)**  and an amendment including at least one claim as prescribed by **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)**, unless the provisional application under paragraph (c) of this section otherwise contains at least one claim as prescribed by **[35 U.S.C. 112(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e302824912.html##al_d1d85b_2ae65_215)**. The nonprovisional application resulting from conversion of a provisional application must also include the filing fee, search fee, and examination fee for a nonprovisional application, the inventor’s oath or declaration, and the surcharge required by § **[1.16(f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e314702.html##d0e314915)**  if either the basic filing fee for a nonprovisional application or the inventor’s oath or declaration was not present on the filing date accorded the resulting nonprovisional application (_i.e.,_ the filing date of the original provisional application). A request to convert a provisional application to a nonprovisional application must also be filed prior to the earliest of:
        - (i) Abandonment of the provisional application filed under paragraph (c) of this section; or
        - (ii) Expiration of twelve months after the filing date of the provisional application filed under paragraph (c) of this section.

    - (2) The copy of the foreign application and separate cover sheet are filed within the later of sixteen months from the filing date of the prior foreign application, four months from the actual filing date of an application under **[35 U.S.C. 111(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//pltd0e302673aia.html##pltd0e302678aia)**, four months from the date on which the national stage commenced under **[35 U.S.C. 371(b) or (f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e307164.html##d0e307173)**  (§ **[1.491(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//aia_d0e329128.html##aia_d0e329136)** ), four months from the date of the initial submission under **[35 U.S.C. 371](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e307164.html)**  to enter the national stage, or with a petition under paragraph (e) or (f) of this section; and
    - (3) A certified copy of the foreign application is filed within the period specified in paragraph (g)(1) of this section.
- (k) _Requirements for certain applications filed on or after March 16, 2013._If a nonprovisional application filed on or after March 16, 2013, other than a nonprovisional international design application, claims priority to a foreign application filed prior to March 16, 2013, and also contains, or contained at any time, a claim to a claimed invention that has an effective filing date as defined in § **[1.109](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e322413.html)**  that is on or after March 16, 2013, the applicant must provide a statement to that effect within the later of four months from the actual filing date of the nonprovisional application, four months from the date of entry into the national stage as set forth in § **[1.491](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//aia_d0e329128.html)**  in an international application, sixteen months from the filing date of the prior foreign application, or the date that a first claim to a claimed invention that has an effective filing date on or after March 16, 2013, is presented in the nonprovisional application.

# 1.56    Duty to disclose information material to patentability.

[Editor Note: Para. (c)(3) below is applicable only to patent applications filed under **[35 U.S.C. 111(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//pltd0e302673aia.html##pltd0e302678aia)**  or **[363](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e306994313.html)**  on or after September 16, 2012*****]

- (a) A patent by its very nature is affected with a public interest. The public interest is best served, and the most effective patent examination occurs when, at the time an application is being examined, the Office is aware of and evaluates the teachings of all information material to patentability. Each individual associated with the filing and prosecution of a patent application has a duty of candor and good faith in dealing with the Office, which includes a duty to disclose to the Office all information known to that individual to be material to patentability as defined in this section. The duty to disclose information exists with respect to each pending claim until the claim is cancelled or withdrawn from consideration, or the application becomes abandoned. Information material to the patentability of a claim that is cancelled or withdrawn from consideration need not be submitted if the information is not material to the patentability of any claim remaining under consideration in the application. There is no duty to submit information which is not material to the patentability of any existing claim. The duty to disclose all information known to be material to patentability is deemed to be satisfied if all information known to be material to patentability of any claim issued in a patent was cited by the Office or submitted to the Office in the manner prescribed by §§ **[1.97(b)-(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e321609.html)**  and **[1.98](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e321738.html)**. However, no patent will be granted on an application in connection with which fraud on the Office was practiced or attempted or the duty of disclosure was violated through bad faith or intentional misconduct. The Office encourages applicants to carefully examine:
    - (1) Prior art cited in search reports of a foreign patent office in a counterpart application, and
    - (2) The closest information over which individuals associated with the filing or prosecution of a patent application believe any pending claim patentably defines, to make sure that any material information contained therein is disclosed to the Office.
- (b) Under this section, information is material to patentability when it is not cumulative to information already of record or being made of record in the application, and
    - (1) It establishes, by itself or in combination with other information, a _prima facie_ case of unpatentability of a claim; or
    - (2) It refutes, or is inconsistent with, a position the applicant takes in:
        - (i) Opposing an argument of unpatentability relied on by the Office, or
        - (ii) Asserting an argument of patentability.

A _prima facie_ case of unpatentability is established when the information compels a conclusion that a claim is unpatentable under the preponderance of evidence, burden-of-proof standard, giving each term in the claim its broadest reasonable construction consistent with the specification, and before any consideration is given to evidence which may be submitted in an attempt to establish a contrary conclusion of patentability.

- (c) Individuals associated with the filing or prosecution of a patent application within the meaning of this section are:
    - (1) Each inventor named in the application;
    - (2) Each attorney or agent who prepares or prosecutes the application; and
    - (3) Every other person who is substantively involved in the preparation or prosecution of the application and who is associated with the inventor, the applicant, an assignee, or anyone to whom there is an obligation to assign the application.
- (d) Individuals other than the attorney, agent or inventor may comply with this section by disclosing information to the attorney, agent, or inventor.
- (e) In any continuation-in-part application, the duty under this section includes the duty to disclose to the Office all information known to the person to be material to patentability, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, which became available between the filing date of the prior application and the national or PCT international filing date of the continuation-in-part application.

An incorporation by reference by hyperlink or other form of browser executable code is not permitted.
- (f) The examiner may require the applicant to supply a copy of the material incorporated by reference. If the Office requires the applicant to supply a copy of material incorporated by reference, the material must be accompanied by a statement that the copy supplied consists of the same material incorporated by reference in the referencing application.
- (g) Any insertion of material incorporated by reference into the specification or drawings of an application must be by way of an amendment to the specification or drawings. Such an amendment must be accompanied by a statement that the material being inserted is the material previously incorporated by reference and that the amendment contains no new matter.
- (h) An incorporation of material by reference that does not comply with paragraphs (c), (d) or (e) of this section is not effective to incorporate such material unless corrected within any time period set by the Office, but in no case later than the close of prosecution as defined by § **[1.114(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e322625.html)**, or abandonment of the application, whichever occurs earlier. In addition:
    - (1) A correction to comply with paragraph (c)(1) of this section is permitted only if the application as filed clearly conveys an intent to incorporate the material by reference. A mere reference to material does not convey an intent to incorporate the material by reference.
    - (2) A correction to comply with paragraph (c)(2) of this section is only permitted for material that was sufficiently described to uniquely identify the document.
- (i) An application transmittal letter limited to the transmittal of a copy of the specification and drawings from a previously filed application submitted under paragraph (a) or (b) of this section may be signed by a juristic applicant or patent owner.

# SPECIFICATION

# 1.71    Detailed description and specification of the invention.

- (a) The specification must include a written description of the invention or discovery and of the manner and process of making and using the same, and is required to be in such full, clear, concise, and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art or science to which the invention or discovery appertains, or with which it is most nearly connected, to make and use the same.
- (b) The specification must set forth the precise invention for which a patent is solicited, in such manner as to distinguish it from other inventions and from what is old. It must describe completely a specific embodiment of the process, machine, manufacture, composition of matter or improvement invented, and must explain the mode of operation or principle whenever applicable. The best mode contemplated by the inventor of carrying out his invention must be set forth.
- (c) In the case of an improvement, the specification must particularly point out the part or parts of the process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter to which the improvement relates, and the description should be confined to the specific improvement and to such parts as necessarily cooperate with it or as may be necessary to a complete understanding or description of it.
- (d) A copyright or mask work notice may be placed in a design or utility patent application adjacent to copyright and mask work material contained therein. The notice may appear at any appropriate portion of the patent application disclosure. For notices in drawings, see § **[1.84(s)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e320999.html)**. The content of the notice must be limited to only those elements provided for by law. For example, "©1983 John Doe"(17 U.S.C. 401) and "*M* John Doe" (17 U.S.C. 909) would be properly limited and, under current statutes, legally sufficient notices of copyright and mask work, respectively. Inclusion of a copyright or mask work notice will be permitted only if the authorization language set forth in paragraph (e) of this section is included at the beginning (preferably as the first paragraph) of the specification.
- (e) The authorization shall read as follows:
    
    > A portion of the disclosure of this patent document contains material which is subject to (copyright or mask work) protection. The (copyright or mask work) owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or the patent disclosure, as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all (copyright or mask work) rights whatsoever.
    
- (f) The specification must commence on a separate sheet. Each sheet including part of the specification may not include other parts of the application or other information. The claim(s), abstract, and "Sequence Listing" (if required or submitted under § **[1.821(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e333653.html##d0e333702)** ) should not be included on a sheet including any other part of the application.
- (g)
    - (1) The specification may disclose or be amended to disclose the names of the parties to a joint research agreement as defined in § **[1.9(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//aia_d0e313866.html##aia_aia_d0e313917)**.
    - (2) An amendment under paragraph (g)(1) of this section must be accompanied by the processing fee set forth in § **[1.17(i)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//eff_20130320_d0e315199.html)**  if not filed within one of the following time periods:
        - (i) Within three months of the filing date of a national application;
        - (ii) Within three months of the date of entry of the national stage as set forth in § **[1.491](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e329128.html)**  in an international application;
        - (iii) Before the mailing of a first Office action on the merits; or
        - (iv) Before the mailing of a first Office action after the filing of a request for continued examination under § **[1.114](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e322625.html)**.
    - (3) If an amendment under paragraph (g)(1) of this section is filed after the date the issue fee is paid, the patent as issued may not necessarily include the names of the parties to the joint research agreement. If the patent as issued does not include the names of the parties to the joint research agreement, the patent must be corrected to include the names of the parties to the joint research agreement by a certificate of correction under **[35 U.S.C. 255](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e305404.html)**  and § **[1.323](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e326640.html)**  for the amendment to be effective.

# 1.72    Title and abstract.

- (a) The title of the invention may not exceed 500 characters in length and must be as short and specific as possible. Characters that cannot be captured and recorded in the Office’s automated information systems may not be reflected in the Office’s records in such systems or in documents created by the Office. Unless the title is supplied in an application data sheet (§ **[1.76](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e320348.html)** ), the title of the invention should appear as a heading on the first page of the specification.
- (b) A brief abstract of the technical disclosure in the specification must commence on a separate sheet, preferably following the claims, under the heading "Abstract" or "Abstract of the Disclosure." The sheet or sheets presenting the abstract may not include other parts of the application or other material. The abstract must be as concise as the disclosure permits, preferably not exceeding 150 words in length. The purpose of the abstract is to enable the Office and the public generally to determine quickly from a cursory inspection the nature and gist of the technical disclosure.

# 1.73    Summary of the invention.

A brief summary of the invention indicating its nature and substance, which may include a statement of the object of the invention, should precede the detailed description. Such summary should, when set forth, be commensurate with the invention as claimed and any object recited should be that of the invention as claimed.

# 1.74    Reference to drawings.

When there are drawings, there shall be a brief description of the several views of the drawings and the detailed description of the invention shall refer to the different views by specifying the numbers of the figures and to the different parts by use of reference letters or numerals (preferably the latter).

# 1.75    Claim(s).

- (a) The specification must conclude with a claim particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the subject matter which the applicant regards as his invention or discovery.
- (b) More than one claim may be presented provided they differ substantially from each other and are not unduly multiplied.
- (c) One or more claims may be presented in dependent form, referring back to and further limiting another claim or claims in the same application. Any dependent claim which refers to more than one other claim ("multiple dependent claim") shall refer to such other claims in the alternative only. A multiple dependent claim shall not serve as a basis for any other multiple dependent claim. For fee calculation purposes under § **[1.16](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e314702.html)**, a multiple dependent claim will be considered to be that number of claims to which direct reference is made therein. For fee calculation purposes also, any claim depending from a multiple dependent claim will be considered to be that number of claims to which direct reference is made in that multiple dependent claim. In addition to the other filing fees, any original application which is filed with, or is amended to include, multiple dependent claims must have paid therein the fee set forth in § **[1.16(j)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e314702.html)**. Claims in dependent form shall be construed to include all the limitations of the claim incorporated by reference into the dependent claim. A multiple dependent claim shall be construed to incorporate by reference all the limitations of each of the particular claims in relation to which it is being considered.
- (d)
    - (1) The claim or claims must conform to the invention as set forth in the remainder of the specification and the terms and phrases used in the claims must find clear support or antecedent basis in the description so that the meaning of the terms in the claims may be ascertainable by reference to the description. (See § **[1.58(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e319627.html)**.)
    - (2) See §§ **[1.141](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e324081.html)**  to **[1.146](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e324178.html)**  as to claiming different inventions in one application.
- (e) Where the nature of the case admits, as in the case of an improvement, any independent claim should contain in the following order:
    - (1) A preamble comprising a general description of all the elements or steps of the claimed combination which are conventional or known,
    - (2) A phrase such as "wherein the improvement comprises," and
    - (3) Those elements, steps and/or relationships which constitute that portion of the claimed combination which the applicant considers as the new or improved portion.
- (f) If there are several claims, they shall be numbered consecutively in Arabic numerals.
- (g) The least restrictive claim should be presented as claim number 1, and all dependent claims should be grouped together with the claim or claims to which they refer to the extent practicable.
- (h) The claim or claims must commence on a separate physical sheet or electronic page. Any sheet including a claim or portion of a claim may not contain any other parts of the application or other material.
- (i) Where a claim sets forth a plurality of elements or steps, each element or step of the claim should be separated by a line indentation.

# 1.78    Claiming benefit of earlier filing date and cross-references to other applications.

- (a) _Claims under 35 U.S.C. 119(e) for the benefit of a prior-filed provisional application._ An applicant in a nonprovisional application, other than for a design patent, or an international application designating the United States may claim the benefit of one or more prior-filed provisional applications under the conditions set forth in **[35 U.S.C. 119(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e302921.html##d0e302951)**  and this section.
    - (1) The nonprovisional application or international application designating the United States must be:
        - (i) Filed not later than twelve months after the date on which the provisional application was filed, subject to paragraph (b) of this section (a subsequent application); or
        - (ii) Entitled to claim the benefit under **[35 U.S.C. 120](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e303023313.html)**, 121, or 365(c) of a subsequent application that was filed within the period set forth in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section.
    - (2) Each prior-filed provisional application must name the inventor or a joint inventor named in the later-filed application as the inventor or a joint inventor. In addition, each prior-filed provisional application must be entitled to a filing date as set forth in § **[1.53(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//aia_d0e318681.html##plt_d0e318733)**, and the basic filing fee set forth in § **[1.16(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e314702.html##d0e314854)**  must have been paid for such provisional application within the time period set forth in § **[1.53(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//aia_d0e318681.html##aia_d0e319103)**.
    - (3) Any nonprovisional application or international application designating the United States that claims the benefit of one or more prior-filed provisional applications must contain, or be amended to contain, a reference to each such prior-filed provisional application, identifying it by the provisional application number (consisting of series code and serial number). If the later-filed application is a nonprovisional application, the reference required by this paragraph must be included in an application data sheet (§ **[1.76(b)(5)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//plt_d0e320348.html)** ).
    - (4) The reference required by paragraph (a)(3) of this section must be submitted during the pendency of the later-filed application. If the later-filed application is an application filed under **[35 U.S.C. 111(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//pltd0e302673aia.html##pltd0e302678aia)**, this reference must also be submitted within the later of four months from the actual filing date of the later-filed application or sixteen months from the filing date of the prior-filed provisional application. If the later-filed application is a nonprovisional application entering the national stage from an international application under 35 U.S.C. 371, this reference must also be submitted within the later of four months from the date on which the national stage commenced under **[35 U.S.C. 371(b) or (f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e307164.html##d0e307173)**  (§ **[1.491(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//aia_d0e329128.html##aia_d0e329136)** ), four months from the date of the initial submission under **[35 U.S.C. 371](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e307164.html)**  to enter the national stage, or sixteen months from the filing date of the prior-filed provisional application. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, failure to timely submit the reference is considered a waiver of any benefit under **[35 U.S.C. 119(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e302921.html##d0e302951)**  of the prior-filed provisional application. The time periods in this paragraph do not apply if the later-filed application is:
        - (i) An application filed under 35 U.S.C. 111(a) before November 29, 2000; or
        - (ii) An international application filed under 35 U.S.C. 363 before November 29, 2000.
    - (5) If the prior-filed provisional application was filed in a language other than English and both an English-language translation of the prior-filed provisional application and a statement that the translation is accurate were not previously filed in the prior-filed provisional application, the applicant will be notified and given a period of time within which to file, in the prior-filed provisional application, the translation and the statement. If the notice is mailed in a pending nonprovisional application, a timely reply to such a notice must include the filing in the nonprovisional application of either a confirmation that the translation and statement were filed in the provisional application, or an application data sheet (§ **[1.76(b)(5)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//plt_d0e320348.html##aia_d0e320419)** ) eliminating the reference under paragraph (a)(3) of this section to the prior-filed provisional application, or the nonprovisional application will be abandoned. The translation and statement may be filed in the provisional application, even if the provisional application has become abandoned.
    - (6) If a nonprovisional application filed on or after March 16, 2013, claims the benefit of the filing date of a provisional application filed prior to March 16, 2013, and also contains, or contained at any time, a claim to a claimed invention that has an effective filing date as defined in § **[1.109](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e322413.html)**  that is on or after March 16, 2013, the applicant must provide a statement to that effect within the later of four months from the actual filing date of the nonprovisional application, four months from the date of entry into the national stage as set forth in § **[1.491](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//aia_d0e329128.html)**  in an international application, sixteen months from the filing date of the prior-filed provisional application, or the date that a first claim to a claimed invention that has an effective filing date on or after March 16, 2013, is presented in the nonprovisional application. An applicant is not required to provide such a statement if the applicant reasonably believes on the basis of information already known to the individuals designated in § **[1.56(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//aia_d0e319407.html)**  that the nonprovisional application does not, and did not at any time, contain a claim to a claimed invention that has an effective filing date on or after March 16, 2013.
- (b) _Delayed filing of the subsequent nonprovisional application or international application designating the United States._ If the subsequent nonprovisional application or international application designating the United States has a filing date which is after the expiration of the twelve-month period set forth in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section but within two months from the expiration of the period set forth in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, the benefit of the provisional application may be restored under PCT Rule 26_bis_.3 for an international application, or upon petition pursuant to this paragraph, if the delay in filing the subsequent nonprovisional application or international application designating the United States within the period set forth in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section was unintentional.
    - (1) A petition to restore the benefit of a provisional application under this paragraph filed on or after May 13, 2015, must be filed in the subsequent application, and any petition to restore the benefit of a provisional application under this paragraph must include:
        - (i) The reference required by **[35 U.S.C. 119(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e302921.html##d0e302951)**  to the prior-filed provisional application in an application data sheet (§ **[1.76(b)(5)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//plt_d0e320348.html##aia_d0e320419)** ) identifying it by provisional application number (consisting of series code and serial number), unless previously submitted;
        - (ii) The petition fee as set forth in § **[1.17(m)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//eff_20130320_d0e315199.html##eff_20130320_d0e315732)**; and
        - (iii) A statement that the delay in filing the subsequent nonprovisional application or international application designating the United States within the twelve-month period set forth in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section was unintentional. The Director may require additional information where there is a question whether the delay was unintentional.
    - (2) The restoration of the right of priority under **[PCT Rule 26bis.3](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e369679.html##d0e369822)**  to a provisional application does not affect the requirement to include the reference required by paragraph (a)(3) of this section to the provisional application in a national stage application under **[35 U.S.C. 371](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e307164.html)**  within the time period provided by paragraph (a)(4) of this section to avoid the benefit claim being considered waived.
- (c) _Delayed claims under 35 U.S.C. 119(e) for the benefit of a prior-filed provisional application._ If the reference required by **[35 U.S.C. 119(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e302921.html##d0e302951)**  and paragraph (a)(3) of this section is presented in an application after the time period provided by paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the claim under **[35 U.S.C. 119(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e302921.html##d0e302951)**  for the benefit of a prior-filed provisional application may be accepted if the reference identifying the prior-filed application by provisional application number was unintentionally delayed. A petition to accept an unintentionally delayed claim under **[35 U.S.C. 119(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e302921.html##d0e302951)**  for the benefit of a prior-filed provisional application must be accompanied by:

# 1.83    Content of drawing.

- (a) The drawing in a nonprovisional application must show every feature of the invention specified in the claims. However, conventional features disclosed in the description and claims, where their detailed illustration is not essential for a proper understanding of the invention, should be illustrated in the drawing in the form of a graphical drawing symbol or a labeled representation (_e.g.,_ a labeled rectangular box). In addition, tables that are included in the specification and sequences that are included in sequence listings should not be duplicated in the drawings.
- (b) When the invention consists of an improvement on an old machine the drawing must when possible exhibit, in one or more views, the improved portion itself, disconnected from the old structure, and also in another view, so much only of the old structure as will suffice to show the connection of the invention therewith.
- (c) Where the drawings in a nonprovisional application do not comply with the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the examiner shall require such additional illustration within a time period of not less than two months from the date of the sending of a notice thereof. Such corrections are subject to the requirements of § **[1.81(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e320940.html)**.

# 1.84    Standards for drawings.

- (a) _Drawings._ There are two acceptable categories for presenting drawings in utility and design patent applications.
    - (1) _Black ink._ Black and white drawings are normally required. India ink, or its equivalent that secures solid black lines, must be used for drawings; or
    - (2) _Color._ Color drawings are permitted in design applications. Where a design application contains color drawings, the application must include the number of sets of color drawings required by paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section and the specification must contain the reference required by paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section. On rare occasions, color drawings may be necessary as the only practical medium by which to disclose the subject matter sought to be patented in a utility patent application. The color drawings must be of sufficient quality such that all details in the drawings are reproducible in black and white in the printed patent. Color drawings are not permitted in international applications (see PCT Rule 11.13). The Office will accept color drawings in utility patent applications only after granting a petition filed under this paragraph explaining why the color drawings are necessary. Any such petition must include the following:
        - (i) The fee set forth in § **[1.17(h)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//eff_20130320_d0e315199.html)**;
        - (ii) One (1) set of color drawings if submitted via the USPTO patent electronic filing system or three (3) sets of color drawings if not submitted via the USPTO patent electronic filing system; and
        - (iii) An amendment to the specification to insert (unless the specification contains or has been previously amended to contain) the following language as the first paragraph of the brief description of the drawings:
            
            > The patent or application file contains at least one drawing executed in color. Copies of this patent or patent application publication with color drawing(s) will be provided by the Office upon request and payment of the necessary fee.
            
- (b) _Photographs._—
    - (1) _Black and white._ Photographs, including photocopies of photographs, are not ordinarily permitted in utility and design patent applications. The Office will accept photographs in utility and design patent applications, however, if photographs are the only practicable medium for illustrating the claimed invention. For example, photographs or photomicrographs of: electrophoresis gels, blots (_e.g.,_ immunological, western, Southern, and northern), autoradiographs, cell cultures (stained and unstained), histological tissue cross sections (stained and unstained), animals, plants, in vivo imaging, thin layer chromatography plates, crystalline structures, and, in a design patent application, ornamental effects, are acceptable. If the subject matter of the application admits of illustration by a drawing, the examiner may require a drawing in place of the photograph. The photographs must be of sufficient quality so that all details in the photographs are reproducible in the printed patent.
    - (2) _Color photographs._ Color photographs will be accepted in utility and design patent applications if the conditions for accepting color drawings and black and white photographs have been satisfied. See paragraphs (a)(2) and (b)(1) of this section.
- (c) _Identification of drawings._ Identifying indicia should be provided, and if provided, should include the title of the invention, inventor’s name, and application number, or docket number (if any) if an application number has not been assigned to the application. If this information is provided, it must be placed on the front of each sheet within the top margin. Each drawing sheet submitted after the filing date of an application must be identified as either "Replacement Sheet" or "New Sheet" pursuant to § **[1.121(d)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e323020.html)**. If a marked-up copy of any amended drawing figure including annotations indicating the changes made is filed, such marked-up copy must be clearly labeled as "Annotated Sheet" pursuant to § **[1.121(d)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e323020.html)**.
- (d) _Graphic forms in drawings._ Chemical or mathematical formulae, tables, and waveforms may be submitted as drawings, and are subject to the same requirements as drawings. Each chemical or mathematical formula must be labeled as a separate figure, using brackets when necessary, to show that information is properly integrated. Each group of waveforms must be presented as a single figure, using a common vertical axis with time extending along the horizontal axis. Each individual waveform discussed in the specification must be identified with a separate letter designation adjacent to the vertical axis.
- (e) _Type of paper._ Drawings submitted to the Office must be made on paper which is flexible, strong, white, smooth, non-shiny, and durable. All sheets must be reasonably free from cracks, creases, and folds. Only one side of the sheet may be used for the drawing. Each sheet must be reasonably free from erasures and must be free from alterations, overwritings, and interlineations. Photographs must be developed on paper meeting the sheet-size requirements of paragraph (f) of this section and the margin requirements of paragraph (g) of this section. See paragraph (b) of this section for other requirements for photographs.
- (f) _Size of paper._ All drawing sheets in an application must be the same size. One of the shorter sides of the sheet is regarded as its top. The size of the sheets on which drawings are made must be:
    - (1) 21.0 cm. by 29.7 cm. (DIN size A4), or
    - (2) 21.6 cm. by 27.9 cm. (8 1/2 by 11 inches).
- (g) _Margins._ The sheets must not contain frames around the sight (_i.e.,_ the usable surface), but should have scan target points (_i.e.,_ cross-hairs) printed on two catercorner margin corners. Each sheet must include a top margin of at least 2.5 cm. (1 inch), a left side margin of at least 2.5 cm. (1 inch), a right side margin of at least 1.5 cm. (5/8 inch), and a bottom margin of at least 1.0 cm. (3/8 inch), thereby leaving a sight no greater than 17.0 cm. by 26.2 cm. on 21.0 cm. by 29.7 cm. (DIN size A4) drawing sheets, and a sight no greater than 17.6 cm. by 24.4 cm. (6 15/16 by 9 5/8 inches) on 21.6 cm. by 27.9 cm. (8 1/2 by 11 inch) drawing sheets.
- (h) _Views._ The drawing must contain as many views as necessary to show the invention. The views may be plan, elevation, section, or perspective views. Detail views of portions of elements, on a larger scale if necessary, may also be used. All views of the drawing must be grouped together and arranged on the sheet(s) without wasting space, preferably in an upright position, clearly separated from one another, and must not be included in the sheets containing the specifications, claims, or abstract. Views must not be connected by projection lines and must not contain center lines. Waveforms of electrical signals may be connected by dashed lines to show the relative timing of the waveforms.
    - (1) _Exploded views._ Exploded views, with the separated parts embraced by a bracket, to show the relationship or order of assembly of various parts are permissible. When an exploded view is shown in a figure which is on the same sheet as another figure, the exploded view should be placed in brackets.
    - (2) _Partial views._ When necessary, a view of a large machine or device in its entirety may be broken into partial views on a single sheet, or extended over several sheets if there is no loss in facility of understanding the view. Partial views drawn on separate sheets must always be capable of being linked edge to edge so that no partial view contains parts of another partial view. A smaller scale view should be included showing the whole formed by the partial views and indicating the positions of the parts shown. When a portion of a view is enlarged for magnification purposes, the view and the enlarged view must each be labeled as separate views.
        - (i) Where views on two or more sheets form, in effect, a single complete view, the views on the several sheets must be so arranged that the complete figure can be assembled without concealing any part of any of the views appearing on the various sheets.
        - (ii) A very long view may be divided into several parts placed one above the other on a single sheet. However, the relationship between the different parts must be clear and unambiguous.
    - (3) _Sectional views._ The plane upon which a sectional view is taken should be indicated on the view from which the section is cut by a broken line. The ends of the broken line should be designated by Arabic or Roman numerals corresponding to the view number of the sectional view, and should have arrows to indicate the direction of sight. Hatching must be used to indicate section portions of an object, and must be made by regularly spaced oblique parallel lines spaced sufficiently apart to enable the lines to be distinguished without difficulty. Hatching should not impede the clear reading of the reference characters and lead lines. If it is not possible to place reference characters outside the hatched area, the hatching may be broken off wherever reference characters are inserted. Hatching must be at a substantial angle to the surrounding axes or principal lines, preferably 45°. A cross section must be set out and drawn to show all of the materials as they are shown in the view from which the cross section was taken. The parts in cross section must show proper material(s) by hatching with regularly spaced parallel oblique strokes, the space between strokes being chosen on the basis of the total area to be hatched. The various parts of a cross section of the same item should be hatched in the same manner and should accurately and graphically indicate the nature of the material(s) that is illustrated in cross section. The hatching of juxtaposed different elements must be angled in a different way. In the case of large areas, hatching may be confined to an edging drawn around the entire inside of the outline of the area to be hatched. Different types of hatching should have different conventional meanings as regards the nature of a material seen in cross section.
    - (4) _Alternate position._ A moved position may be shown by a broken line superimposed upon a suitable view if this can be done without crowding; otherwise, a separate view must be used for this purpose.
    - (5) _Modified forms._ Modified forms of construction must be shown in separate views.
- (i) _Arrangement of views_ **.** One view must not be placed upon another or within the outline of another. All views on the same sheet should stand in the same direction and, if possible, stand so that they can be read with the sheet held in an upright position. If views wider than the width of the sheet are necessary for the clearest illustration of the invention, the sheet may be turned on its side so that the top of the sheet, with the appropriate top margin to be used as the heading space, is on the right-hand side. Words must appear in a horizontal, left-to-right fashion when the page is either upright or turned so that the top becomes the right side, except for graphs utilizing standard scientific convention to denote the axis of abscissas (of X) and the axis of ordinates (of Y).
- (j) _Front page view._ The drawing must contain as many views as necessary to show the invention. One of the views should be suitable for inclusion on the front page of the patent application publication and patent as the illustration of the invention. Views must not be connected by projection lines and must not contain center lines. Applicant may suggest a single view (by figure number) for inclusion on the front page of the patent application publication and patent.
- (k) _Scale._ The scale to which a drawing is made must be large enough to show the mechanism without crowding when the drawing is reduced in size to two-thirds in reproduction. Indications such as "actual size" or "scale 1/2" on the drawings are not permitted since these lose their meaning with reproduction in a different format.
- (l) _Character of lines, numbers, and letters._ All drawings must be made by a process which will give them satisfactory reproduction characteristics. Every line, number, and letter must be durable, clean, black (except for color drawings), sufficiently dense and dark, and uniformly thick and well-defined. The weight of all lines and letters must be heavy enough to permit adequate reproduction. This requirement applies to all lines however fine, to shading, and to lines representing cut surfaces in sectional views. Lines and strokes of different thicknesses may be used in the same drawing where different thicknesses have a different meaning.
- (m) _Shading._ The use of shading in views is encouraged if it aids in understanding the invention and if it does not reduce legibility. Shading is used to indicate the surface or shape of spherical, cylindrical, and conical elements of an object. Flat parts may also be lightly shaded. Such shading is preferred in the case of parts shown in perspective, but not for cross sections. See paragraph (h)(3) of this section. Spaced lines for shading are preferred. These lines must be thin, as few in number as practicable, and they must contrast with the rest of the drawings. As a substitute for shading, heavy lines on the shade side of objects can be used except where they superimpose on each other or obscure reference characters. Light should come from the upper left corner at an angle of 45°. Surface delineations should preferably be shown by proper shading. Solid black shading areas are not permitted, except when used to represent bar graphs or color.
- (n) _Symbols._ Graphical drawing symbols may be used for conventional elements when appropriate. The elements for which such symbols and labeled representations are used must be adequately identified in the specification. Known devices should be illustrated by symbols which have a universally recognized conventional meaning and are generally accepted in the art. Other symbols which are not universally recognized may be used, subject to approval by the Office, if they are not likely to be confused with existing conventional symbols, and if they are readily identifiable.
- (o) _Legends._ Suitable descriptive legends may be used subject to approval by the Office, or may be required by the examiner where necessary for understanding of the drawing. They should contain as few words as possible.
- (p) _Numbers, letters, and reference characters._
    - (1) Reference characters (numerals are preferred), sheet numbers, and view numbers must be plain and legible, and must not be used in association with brackets or inverted commas, or enclosed within outlines, _e.g.,_ encircled. They must be oriented in the same direction as the view so as to avoid having to rotate the sheet. Reference characters should be arranged to follow the profile of the object depicted.
    - (2) The English alphabet must be used for letters, except where another alphabet is customarily used, such as the Greek alphabet to indicate angles, wavelengths, and mathematical formulas.
    - (3) Numbers, letters, and reference characters must measure at least .32 cm. (1/8 inch) in height. They should not be placed in the drawing so as to interfere with its comprehension. Therefore, they should not cross or mingle with the lines. They should not be placed upon hatched or shaded surfaces. When necessary, such as indicating a surface or cross section, a reference character may be underlined and a blank space may be left in the hatching or shading where the character occurs so that it appears distinct.
    - (4) The same part of an invention appearing in more than one view of the drawing must always be designated by the same reference character, and the same reference character must never be used to designate different parts.
    - (5) Reference characters not mentioned in the description shall not appear in the drawings. Reference characters mentioned in the description must appear in the drawings.
- (q) _Lead lines._ Lead lines are those lines between the reference characters and the details referred to. Such lines may be straight or curved and should be as short as possible. They must originate in the immediate proximity of the reference character and extend to the feature indicated. Lead lines must not cross each other. Lead lines are required for each reference character except for those which indicate the surface or cross section on which they are placed. Such a reference character must be underlined to make it clear that a lead line has not been left out by mistake. Lead lines must be executed in the same way as lines in the drawing. See paragraph (l) of this section.
- (r) _Arrows._ Arrows may be used at the ends of the lines, provided that their meaning is clear, as follows:
    - (1) On a lead line, a freestanding arrow to indicate the entire section towards which it points;
    - (2) On a lead line, an arrow touching a line to indicate the surface shown by the line looking along the direction of the arrow; or
    - (3) To show the direction of movement.
- (s) _Copyright or Mask Work Notice._ A copyright or mask work notice may appear in the drawing, but must be placed within the sight of the drawing immediately below the figure representing the copyright or mask work material and be limited to letters having a print size of .32 cm. to .64 cm. (1/8 to 1/4 inches) high. The content of the notice must be limited to only those elements provided for by law. For example, "©1983 John Doe" (17 U.S.C. 401) and "*M* John Doe" (17 U.S.C. 909) would be properly limited and, under current statutes, legally sufficient notices of copyright and mask work, respectively. Inclusion of a copyright or mask work notice will be permitted only if the authorization language set forth in § **[1.71(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e320131.html)**  is included at the beginning (preferably as the first paragraph) of the specification.
- (t) _Numbering of sheets of drawings._ The sheets of drawings should be numbered in consecutive Arabic numerals, starting with 1, within the sight as defined in paragraph (g) of this section. These numbers, if present, must be placed in the middle of the top of the sheet, but not in the margin. The numbers can be placed on the right-hand side if the drawing extends too close to the middle of the top edge of the usable surface. The drawing sheet numbering must be clear and larger than the numbers used as reference characters to avoid confusion. The number of each sheet should be shown by two Arabic numerals placed on either side of an oblique line, with the first being the sheet number and the second being the total number of sheets of drawings, with no other marking.
- (u) _Numbering of views._
    - (1) The different views must be numbered in consecutive Arabic numerals, starting with 1, independent of the numbering of the sheets and, if possible, in the order in which they appear on the drawing sheet(s). Partial views intended to form one complete view, on one or several sheets, must be identified by the same number followed by a capital letter. View numbers must be preceded by the abbreviation "FIG." Where only a single view is used in an application to illustrate the claimed invention, it must not be numbered and the abbreviation "FIG." must not appear.
    - (2) Numbers and letters identifying the views must be simple and clear and must not be used in association with brackets, circles, or inverted commas. The view numbers must be larger than the numbers used for reference characters.
- (v) _Security markings_ **.** Authorized security markings may be placed on the drawings provided they are outside the sight, preferably centered in the top margin.
- (w) _Corrections._ Any corrections on drawings submitted to the Office must be durable and permanent.
- (x) _Holes._ No holes should be made by applicant in the drawing sheets.
- (y) _Types of drawings._ See § **[1.152](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e324205.html)**  for design drawings, § 1.1026 for international design reproductions, § **[1.165](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e324521.html)**  for plant drawings, and § **[1.173(a)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e324614.html)**  for reissue drawings.

# 1.104    Nature of examination.

- (a) _Examiner’s action._
    - (1) On taking up an application for examination or a patent in a reexamination proceeding, the examiner shall make a thorough study thereof and shall make a thorough investigation of the available prior art relating to the subject matter of the claimed invention. The examination shall be complete with respect both to compliance of the application or patent under reexamination with the applicable statutes and rules and to the patentability of the invention as claimed, as well as with respect to matters of form, unless otherwise indicated.
    - (2) The applicant, or in the case of a reexamination proceeding, both the patent owner and the requester, will be notified of the examiner’s action. The reasons for any adverse action or any objection or requirement will be stated in an Office action and such information or references will be given as may be useful in aiding the applicant, or in the case of a reexamination proceeding the patent owner, to judge the propriety of continuing the prosecution.
    - (3) An international-type search will be made in all national applications filed on and after June 1, 1978.
    - (4) Any national application may also have an international-type search report prepared thereon at the time of the national examination on the merits, upon specific written request therefor and payment of the international-type search report fee set forth in § **[1.21(e)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e316474.html)**. The Patent and Trademark Office does not require that a formal report of an international-type search be prepared in order to obtain a search fee refund in a later filed international application.
- (b) _Completeness of examiner’s action._ The examiner’s action will be complete as to all matters, except that in appropriate circumstances, such as misjoinder of invention, fundamental defects in the application, and the like, the action of the examiner may be limited to such matters before further action is made. However, matters of form need not be raised by the examiner until a claim is found allowable.
- (c) _Rejection of claims._
    - (1) If the invention is not considered patentable, or not considered patentable as claimed, the claims, or those considered unpatentable will be rejected.
    - (2) In rejecting claims for want of novelty or for obviousness, the examiner must cite the best references at his or her command. When a reference is complex or shows or describes inventions other than that claimed by the applicant, the particular part relied on must be designated as nearly as practicable. The pertinence of each reference, if not apparent, must be clearly explained and each rejected claim specified.
    - (3) In rejecting claims the examiner may rely upon admissions by the applicant, or the patent owner in a reexamination proceeding, as to any matter affecting patentability and, insofar as rejections in applications are concerned, may also rely upon facts within his or her knowledge pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section.
    - (4)

            - (C) Placement of the application in condition for allowance;
            - (D) Reply to an Office requirement made after the first reply was filed;
            - (E) Correction of informalities (_e.g.,_ typographical errors); or
            - (F) Simplification of issues for appeal.
        - (ii) A supplemental reply will be entered if the supplemental reply is filed within the period during which action by the Office is suspended under § **[1.103(a) or (c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e321982.html##d0e321990)**.
- (b) In order to be entitled to reconsideration or further examination, the applicant or patent owner must reply to the Office action. The reply by the applicant or patent owner must be reduced to a writing which distinctly and specifically points out the supposed errors in the examiner’s action and must reply to every ground of objection and rejection in the prior Office action. The reply must present arguments pointing out the specific distinctions believed to render the claims, including any newly presented claims, patentable over any applied references. If the reply is with respect to an application, a request may be made that objections or requirements as to form not necessary to further consideration of the claims be held in abeyance until allowable subject matter is indicated. The applicant’s or patent owner’s reply must appear throughout to be a _bona fide_ attempt to advance the application or the reexamination proceeding to final action. A general allegation that the claims define a patentable invention without specifically pointing out how the language of the claims patentably distinguishes them from the references does not comply with the requirements of this section.
- (c) In amending in reply to a rejection of claims in an application or patent under reexamination, the applicant or patent owner must clearly point out the patentable novelty which he or she thinks the claims present in view of the state of the art disclosed by the references cited or the objections made. The applicant or patent owner must also show how the amendments avoid such references or objections.

# 1.121    Manner of making amendments in applications.

- (a) _Amendments in applications, other than reissue applications._ Amendments in applications, other than reissue applications, are made by filing a paper, in compliance with § **[1.52](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e318327.html)**, directing that specified amendments be made.
- (b) _Specification._ Amendments to the specification, other than the claims, "Large Tables" (§ **[1.58(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e319627.html##d0e319657)** ), a "Computer Program Listing Appendix" (§ **[1.96(c)(5)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e321513.html##ar_it_337f0_1d67c_271)**  and **[(7)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e321513.html##ar_it_337f0_1d7fe_91)** ), a "Sequence Listing" (§ **[1.825](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e334511.html)** ), or a "Sequence Listing XML" (§ **[1.835](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//ar_d35d57_1be4d_1f4.html)** ), must be made by adding, deleting, or replacing a paragraph; by replacing a section; or by providing a substitute specification, in the manner specified in this section.
    - (1) _Amendment to delete, replace, or add a paragraph._ Amendments to the specification, including amendment to a section heading or the title of the invention which are considered for amendment purposes to be an amendment of a paragraph, must be made by submitting:
        - (i) An instruction, which unambiguously identifies the location, to delete one or more paragraphs of the specification, replace a paragraph with one or more replacement paragraphs, or add one or more paragraphs;
        - (ii) The full text of any replacement paragraph with markings to show all the changes relative to the previous version of the paragraph. The text of any added subject matter must be shown by underlining the added text. The text of any deleted matter must be shown by strike-through except that double brackets placed before and after the deleted characters may be used to show deletion of five or fewer consecutive characters. The text of any deleted subject matter must be shown by being placed within double brackets if strike-through cannot be easily perceived;
        - (iii) The full text of any added paragraphs without any underlining; and
        - (iv) The text of a paragraph to be deleted must not be presented with strike-through or placed within double brackets. The instruction to delete may identify a paragraph by its paragraph number or include a few words from the beginning, and end, of the paragraph, if needed for paragraph identification purposes.
    - (2) _Amendment by replacement section._ If the sections of the specification contain section headings as provided in § **[1.77(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e320555.html)**, § **[1.154(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e324243.html)**, or § **[1.163(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e324410.html)**, amendments to the specification, other than the claims, may be made by submitting:
        - (i) A reference to the section heading along with an instruction, which unambiguously identifies the location, to delete that section of the specification and to replace such deleted section with a replacement section; and
        - (ii) A replacement section with markings to show all changes relative to the previous version of the section. The text of any added subject matter must be shown by underlining the added text. The text of any deleted matter must be shown by strike-through except that double brackets placed before and after the deleted characters may be used to show deletion of five or fewer consecutive characters. The text of any deleted subject matter must be shown by being placed within double brackets if strike-through cannot be easily perceived.
    - (3) _Amendment by substitute specification._ The specification, other than the claims, may also be amended by submitting:
        - (i) An instruction to replace the specification; and
        - (ii) A substitute specification in compliance with §§ **[1.125(b) and (c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e323278.html)**.
    - (4) _Reinstatement of previously deleted paragraph or section._ A previously deleted paragraph or section may be reinstated only by a subsequent amendment adding the previously deleted paragraph or section.
    - (5) _Presentation in subsequent amendment document._ Once a paragraph or section is amended in a first amendment document, the paragraph or section shall not be represented in a subsequent amendment document unless it is amended again or a substitute specification is provided.
    - (6) _Amendments to "Large Tables," a "Computer Program Listing Appendix," a "Sequence Listing," or a "Sequence Listing XML."_ Changes to "Large Tables," a "Computer Program Listing Appendix," a "Sequence Listing," or a "Sequence Listing XML" must be made in accordance with § **[1.58(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e319627.html##ar_it_337ef_2242e_26b)**  for "Large Tables," § **[1.96(c)(5)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e321513.html##ar_it_337f0_1d67c_271)**  for a "Computer Program Listing Appendix," § **[1.825](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e334511.html)**  for a "Sequence Listing," or § **[1.835](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//ar_d35d57_1be4d_1f4.html)**  for a "Sequence Listing XML."
- (c) _Claims._ Amendments to a claim must be made by rewriting the entire claim with all changes (_e.g.,_ additions and deletions) as indicated in this subsection, except when the claim is being canceled. Each amendment document that includes a change to an existing claim, cancellation of an existing claim or addition of a new claim, must include a complete listing of all claims ever presented, including the text of all pending and withdrawn claims, in the application. The claim listing, including the text of the claims, in the amendment document will serve to replace all prior versions of the claims, in the application. In the claim listing, the status of every claim must be indicated after its claim number by using one of the following identifiers in a parenthetical expression: (Original), (Currently amended), (Canceled), (Withdrawn), (Previously presented), (New), and (Not entered).
    - (1) _Claim listing._ All of the claims presented in a claim listing shall be presented in ascending numerical order. Consecutive claims having the same status of "canceled" or "not entered" may be aggregated into one statement (_e.g.,_ Claims 1–5 (canceled)). The claim listing shall commence on a separate sheet of the amendment document and the sheet(s) that contain the text of any part of the claims shall not contain any other part of the amendment.
    - (2) _When claim text with markings is required._ All claims being currently amended in an amendment paper shall be presented in the claim listing, indicate a status of "currently amended," and be submitted with markings to indicate the changes that have been made relative to the immediate prior version of the claims. The text of any added subject matter must be shown by underlining the added text. The text of any deleted matter must be shown by strike-through except that double brackets placed before and after the deleted characters may be used to show deletion of five or fewer consecutive characters. The text of any deleted subject matter must be shown by being placed within double brackets if strike-through cannot be easily perceived. Only claims having the status of "currently amended," or "withdrawn" if also being amended, shall include markings. If a withdrawn claim is currently amended, its status in the claim listing may be identified as "withdrawn— currently amended."
    - (3) _When claim text in clean version is required._ The text of all pending claims not being currently amended shall be presented in the claim listing in clean version, _i.e.,_ without any markings in the presentation of text. The presentation of a clean version of any claim having the status of "original," "withdrawn" or "previously presented" will constitute an assertion that it has not been changed relative to the immediate prior version, except to omit markings that may have been present in the immediate prior version of the claims of the status of "withdrawn" or "previously presented." Any claim added by amendment must be indicated with the status of "new" and presented in clean version, _i.e.,_ without any underlining.
    - (4) _When claim text shall not be presented; canceling a claim._
        - (i) No claim text shall be presented for any claim in the claim listing with the status of "canceled" or "not entered."
        - (ii) Cancellation of a claim shall be effected by an instruction to cancel a particular claim number. Identifying the status of a claim in the claim listing as "canceled" will constitute an instruction to cancel the claim.
    - (5) _Reinstatement of previously canceled claim._ A claim which was previously canceled may be reinstated only by adding the claim as a "new" claim with a new claim number.
- (d) _Drawings._ One or more application drawings shall be amended in the following manner: Any changes to an application drawing must be in compliance with § **[1.84](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e320999.html)**  or, for a nonprovisional international design application, in compliance with §§ **[1.84(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e320999.html##d0e321067)**  and **[1.1026](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//ar_d22557_188bd_336.html)**  and must be submitted on a replacement sheet of drawings which shall be an attachment to the amendment document and, in the top margin, labeled "Replacement Sheet." Any replacement sheet of drawings shall include all of the figures appearing on the immediate prior version of the sheet, even if only one figure is amended. Any new sheet of drawings containing an additional figure must be labeled in the top margin as "New Sheet." All changes to the drawings shall be explained, in detail, in either the drawing amendment or remarks section of the amendment paper.
    - (1) A marked-up copy of any amended drawing figure, including annotations indicating the changes made, may be included. The marked-up copy must be clearly labeled as "Annotated Sheet" and must be presented in the amendment or remarks section that explains the change to the drawings.
    - (2) A marked-up copy of any amended drawing figure, including annotations indicating the changes made, must be provided when required by the examiner.
- (e) _Disclosure consistency._ The disclosure must be amended, when required by the Office, to correct inaccuracies of description and definition, and to secure substantial correspondence between the claims, the remainder of the specification, and the drawings.
- (f) _No new matter._ No amendment may introduce new matter into the disclosure of an application.
- (g) _Exception for examiner’s amendments._ Changes to the specification, including the claims, of an application made by the Office in an examiner’s amendment may be made by specific instructions to insert or delete subject matter set forth in the examiner’s amendment by identifying the precise point in the specification or the claim(s) where the insertion or deletion is to be made. Compliance with paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), or (c) of this section is not required.
- (h) _Amendment sections._ Each section of an amendment document (_e.g.,_ amendment to the claims, amendment to the specification, replacement drawings, and remarks) must begin on a separate sheet.
- (i) _Amendments in reissue applications._ Any amendment to the description and claims in reissue applications must be made in accordance with § **[1.173](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e324614.html)**.
- (j) _Amendments in reexamination proceedings._ Any proposed amendment to the description and claims in patents involved in reexamination proceedings must be made in accordance with § **[1.530](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e330194.html)**.
- (k) _Amendments in provisional applications._ Amendments in provisional applications are not usually made. If an amendment is made to a provisional application, however, it must comply with the provisions of this section. Any amendments to a provisional application shall be placed in the provisional application file but may not be entered.

# TIME FOR REPLY BY APPLICANT; ABANDONMENT OF APPLICATION

# 1.134    Time period for reply to an Office action.

An Office action will notify the applicant of any non-statutory or shortened statutory time period set for reply to an Office action. Unless the applicant is notified in writing that a reply is required in less than six months, a maximum period of six months is allowed.

- (b) Prosecution of an application to save it from abandonment pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section must include such complete and proper reply as the condition of the application may require. The admission of, or refusal to admit, any amendment after final rejection or any amendment not responsive to the last action, or any related proceedings, will not operate to save the application from abandonment.
- (c) When reply by the applicant is a _bona fide_ attempt to advance the application to final action, and is substantially a complete reply to the non-final Office action, but consideration of some matter or compliance with some requirement has been inadvertently omitted, applicant may be given a new time period for reply under § **[1.134](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e323607.html)**  to supply the omission.

    - (3) A written request may be submitted in an application that is an authorization to treat any concurrent or future reply, requiring a petition for an extension of time under this paragraph for its timely submission, as incorporating a petition for extension of time for the appropriate length of time. An authorization to charge all required fees, fees under § **[1.17](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//eff_20130320_d0e315199.html)**, or all required extension of time fees will be treated as a constructive petition for an extension of time in any concurrent or future reply requiring a petition for an extension of time under this paragraph for its timely submission.

# JOINDER OF INVENTIONS IN ONE APPLICATION; RESTRICTION

# 1.141    Different inventions in one national application.

- (a) Two or more independent and distinct inventions may not be claimed in one national application, except that more than one species of an invention, not to exceed a reasonable number, may be specifically claimed in different claims in one national application, provided the application also includes an allowable claim generic to all the claimed species and all the claims to species in excess of one are written in dependent form (§ **[1.75](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e320269.html)** ) or otherwise include all the limitations of the generic claim.
- (b) Where claims to all three categories, product, process of making, and process of use, are included in a national application, a three way requirement for restriction can only be made where the process of making is distinct from the product. If the process of making and the product are not distinct, the process of using may be joined with the claims directed to the product and the process of making the product even though a showing of distinctness between the product and process of using the product can be made.

[52 FR 20046, May 28, 1987, effective July 1, 1987]

# 1.142    Requirement for restriction.

- (a) If two or more independent and distinct inventions are claimed in a single application, the examiner in an Office action will require the applicant in the reply to that action to elect an invention to which the claims will be restricted, this official action being called a requirement for restriction (also known as a requirement for division). Such requirement will normally be made before any action on the merits; however, it may be made at any time before final action.
- (b) Claims to the invention or inventions not elected, if not canceled, are nevertheless withdrawn from further consideration by the examiner by the election, subject however to reinstatement in the event the requirement for restriction is withdrawn or overruled.

[Para (a) revised, 62 FR 53132, Oct. 10, 1997, effective Dec. 1, 1997; para. (a) revised and (c) added, 72 FR 46716, Aug. 21, 2007 (implementation enjoined and never became effective); para.

# 1.143    Reconsideration of requirement.

If the applicant disagrees with the requirement for restriction, he may request reconsideration and withdrawal or modification of the requirement, giving the reasons therefor. (See § **[1.111](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e322449.html)**.) In requesting reconsideration the applicant must indicate a provisional election of one invention for prosecution, which invention shall be the one elected in the event the requirement becomes final. The requirement for restriction will be reconsidered on such a request. If the requirement is repeated and made final, the examiner will at the same time act on the claims to the invention elected.

# 1.144    Petition from requirement for restriction.

After a final requirement for restriction, the applicant, in addition to making any reply due on the remainder of the action, may petition the Director to review the requirement. Petition may be deferred until after final action on or allowance of claims to the invention elected, but must be filed not later than appeal. A petition will not be considered if reconsideration of the requirement was not requested (see § **[1.181](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e324913.html)** ).

# 1.145    Subsequent presentation of claims for different invention.

If, after an office action on an application, the applicant presents claims directed to an invention distinct from and independent of the invention previously claimed, the applicant will be required to restrict the claims to the invention previously claimed if the amendment is entered, subject to reconsideration and review as provided in §§ **[1.143](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e324130.html)**  and **[1.144](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e324143.html)**.

# 1.146    Election of species.

In the first action on an application containing a generic claim to a generic invention (genus) and claims to more than one patentably distinct species embraced thereby, the examiner may require the applicant in the reply to that action to elect a species of his or her invention to which his or her claim will be restricted if no claim to the genus is found to be allowable. However, if such application contains claims directed to more than a reasonable number of species, the examiner may require restriction of the claims to not more than a reasonable number of species before taking further action in the application.

# DESIGN PATENTS

# 1.151    Rules applicable.

The rules relating to applications for patents for other inventions or discoveries are also applicable to applications for patents for designs except as otherwise provided.

# 1.152    Design drawings.

The design must be represented by a drawing that complies with the requirements of § **[1.84](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e320999.html)**  and must contain a sufficient number of views to constitute a complete disclosure of the appearance of the design. Appropriate and adequate surface shading should be used to show the character or contour of the surfaces represented. Solid black surface shading is not permitted except when used to represent the color black as well as color contrast. Broken lines may be used to show visible environmental structure, but may not be used to show hidden planes and surfaces that cannot be seen through opaque materials. Alternate positions of a design component, illustrated by full and broken lines in the same view are not permitted in a design drawing. Photographs and ink drawings are not permitted to be combined as formal drawings in one application. Photographs submitted in lieu of ink drawings in design patent applications must not disclose environmental structure but must be limited to the design claimed for the article.

If restriction is required, the subject matter of the original patent claims will be held to be constructively elected unless a disclaimer of all the patent claims is filed in the reissue application, which disclaimer cannot be withdrawn by applicant.

# 1.177    Issuance of multiple reissue patents.

- (a) The Office may reissue a patent as multiple reissue patents. If applicant files more than one application for the reissue of a single patent, each such application must contain or be amended to contain in the first sentence of the specification a notice stating that more than one reissue application has been filed and identifying each of the reissue applications by relationship, application number and filing date. The Office may correct by certificate of correction under § **[1.322](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e326574.html)**  any reissue patent resulting from an application to which this paragraph applies that does not contain the required notice.
- (b) If applicant files more than one application for the reissue of a single patent, each claim of the patent being reissued must be presented in each of the reissue applications as an amended, unamended, or canceled (shown in brackets) claim, with each such claim bearing the same number as in the patent being reissued. The same claim of the patent being reissued may not be presented in its original unamended form for examination in more than one of such multiple reissue applications. The numbering of any added claims in any of the multiple reissue applications must follow the number of the highest numbered original patent claim.
- (c) If any one of the several reissue applications by itself fails to correct an error in the original patent as required by **[35 U.S.C. 251](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e305345.html)**  but is otherwise in condition for allowance, the Office may suspend action in the allowable application until all issues are resolved as to at least one of the remaining reissue applications. The Office may also merge two or more of the multiple reissue applications into a single reissue application. No reissue application containing only unamended patent claims and not correcting an error in the original patent will be passed to issue by itself.

# 1.178    Original patent; continuing duty of applicant.

- (a) The application for reissue of a patent shall constitute an offer to surrender that patent, and the surrender shall take effect upon reissue of the patent. Until a reissue application is granted, the original patent shall remain in effect.
- (b) In any reissue application before the Office, the applicant must call to the attention of the Office any prior or concurrent proceedings in which the patent (for which reissue is requested) is or was involved, such as interferences or trials before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, reissues, reexaminations, or litigations and the results of such proceedings (see also § **[1.173(a)(1)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e324614.html)** ).

    - (1) From any action or requirement of any examiner in the _ex parte_ prosecution of an application, or in _ex parte_ or _inter partes_ prosecution of a reexamination proceeding which is not subject to appeal to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board or to the court;
    - (2) In cases in which a statute or the rules specify that the matter is to be determined directly by or reviewed by the Director; and
    - (3) To invoke the supervisory authority of the Director in appropriate circumstances. For petitions involving action of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, see § **[41.3](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e355820.html)**  of this title.
- (b) Any such petition must contain a statement of the facts involved and the point or points to be reviewed and the action requested. Briefs or memoranda, if any, in support thereof should accompany or be embodied in the petition; and where facts are to be proven, the proof in the form of affidavits or declarations (and exhibits, if any) must accompany the petition.
- (c) When a petition is taken from an action or requirement of an examiner in the _ex parte_ prosecution of an application, or in the _ex parte_ or _inter partes_ prosecution of a reexamination proceeding, it may be required that there have been a proper request for reconsideration (§ **[1.111](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e322449.html)** ) and a repeated action by the examiner. The examiner may be directed by the Director to furnish a written statement, within a specified time, setting forth the reasons for his or her decision upon the matters averred in the petition, supplying a copy to the petitioner.
- (d) Where a fee is required for a petition to the Director the appropriate section of this part will so indicate. If any required fee does not accompany the petition, the petition will be dismissed.
- (e) Oral hearing will not be granted except when considered necessary by the Director.
- (f) The mere filing of a petition will not stay any period for reply that may be running against the application, nor act as a stay of other proceedings. Any petition under this part not filed within two months of the mailing date of the action or notice from which relief is requested may be dismissed as untimely, except as otherwise provided. This two-month period is not extendable.
- (g) The Director may delegate to appropriate Patent and Trademark Office officials the determination of petitions.

    - (2) Consideration of a request for continued examination in compliance with § **[1.114](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e322625.html)**; or
    - (3) Express abandonment of the application. Such express abandonment may be in favor of a continuing application.
- (d) A petition under this section will not be effective to withdraw the application from issue unless it is actually received and granted by the appropriate officials before the date of issue. Withdrawal of an application from issue after payment of the issue fee may not be effective to avoid publication of application information.

# 1.366    Submission of maintenance fees.

- (a) The patentee may pay maintenance fees and any necessary surcharges, or any person or organization may pay maintenance fees and any necessary surcharges on behalf of a patentee. A maintenance fee transmittal letter may be signed by a juristic applicant or patent owner. A patentee need not file authorization to enable any person or organization to pay maintenance fees and any necessary surcharges on behalf of the patentee.
- (b) A maintenance fee and any necessary surcharge submitted for a patent must be submitted in the amount due on the date the maintenance fee and any necessary surcharge are paid. A maintenance fee or surcharge may be paid in the manner set forth in § **[1.23](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e316783.html)**  or by an authorization to charge a deposit account established pursuant to § **[1.25](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e316815.html)**. Payment of a maintenance fee and any necessary surcharge or the authorization to charge a deposit account must be submitted within the periods set forth in § **[1.362(d), (e), or (f)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e326870.html)**. Any payment or authorization of maintenance fees and surcharges filed at any other time will not be accepted and will not serve as a payment of the maintenance fee except insofar as a delayed payment of the maintenance fee is accepted by the Director in an expired patent pursuant to a petition filed under § **[1.378](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e327126.html)**. Any authorization to charge a deposit account must authorize the immediate charging of the maintenance fee and any necessary surcharge to the deposit account. Payment of less than the required amount, payment in a manner other than that set forth in § **[1.23](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e316783.html)**, or in the filing of an authorization to charge a deposit account having insufficient funds will not constitute payment of a maintenance fee or surcharge on a patent. The procedures set forth in § **[1.8](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e313726.html)**  or § **[1.10](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e313951.html)**  may be utilized in paying maintenance fees and any necessary surcharges.
- (c) In submitting maintenance fees and any necessary surcharges, identification of the patents for which maintenance fees are being paid must include the patent number, and the application number of the United States application for the patent on which the maintenance fee is being paid. If the payment includes identification of only the patent number (_i.e.,_ does not identify the application number of the United States application for the patent on which the maintenance fee is being paid), the Office may apply the payment to the patent identified by patent number in the payment or may return the payment.
- (d) Payment of maintenance fees and any surcharges should identify the fee being paid for each patent as to whether it is the 3 1/2-, 7 1/2-, or 11 1/2-year fee, whether small entity status is being changed or claimed, the amount of the maintenance fee and any surcharge being paid, and any assigned customer number. If the maintenance fee and any necessary surcharge is being paid on a reissue patent, the payment must identify the reissue patent by reissue patent number and reissue application number as required by paragraph (c) of this section and should also include the original patent number.
- (e) Maintenance fee payments and surcharge payments relating thereto must be submitted separate from any other payments for fees or charges, whether submitted in the manner set forth in § **[1.23](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e316783.html)**  or by an authorization to charge a deposit account. If maintenance fee and surcharge payments for more than one patent are submitted together, they should be submitted on as few sheets as possible with the patent numbers listed in increasing patent number order. If the payment submitted is insufficient to cover the maintenance fees and surcharges for all the listed patents, the payment will be applied in the order the patents are listed, beginning at the top of the listing.
- (f) Notification of any change in status resulting in loss of entitlement to small entity status must be filed in a patent prior to paying, or at the time of paying, the earliest maintenance fee due after the date on which status as a small entity is no longer appropriate. See § **[1.27(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//aia_d0e316949.html)**.
- (g) Maintenance fees and surcharges relating thereto will not be refunded except in accordance with §§ **[1.26](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e316905.html)**  and **[1.28(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e317241.html)**.

# 1.446    Refund of international application filing and processing fees.

- (a) Money paid for international application fees, where paid by actual mistake or in excess, such as a payment not required by law or treaty and its regulations, may be refunded. A mere change of purpose after the payment of a fee will not entitle a party to a refund of such fee. The Office will not refund amounts of twenty-five dollars or less unless a refund is specifically requested and will not notify the payor of such amounts. If the payor or party requesting a refund does not provide the banking information necessary for making refunds by electronic funds transfer, the Office may use the banking information provided on the payment instrument to make any refund by electronic funds transfer.
- (b) Any request for refund under paragraph (a) of this section must be filed within two years from the date the fee was paid. If the Office charges a deposit account by an amount other than an amount specifically indicated in an authorization under § **[1.25(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e316815.html)**, any request for refund based upon such charge must be filed within two years from the date of the deposit account statement indicating such charge and include a copy of that deposit account statement. The time periods set forth in this paragraph are not extendable.
- (c) Refund of the supplemental search fees will be made if such refund is determined to be warranted by the Director or the Director’s designee acting under **[PCT Rule 40.2(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e370760.html##d0e370797)**.
- (d) The international and search fees will be refunded if no international filing date is accorded or if the application is withdrawn before transmittal of the record copy to the International Bureau (PCT Rules 15.6 and **[16.2](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e368100.html##d0e368148)** ).

# UNITY OF INVENTION

# 1.475    Unity of invention before the International Searching Authority, the International Preliminary Examining Authority and during the national stage.

- (a) An international and a national stage application shall relate to one invention only or to a group of inventions so linked as to form a single general inventive concept ("requirement of unity of invention"). Where a group of inventions is claimed in an application, the requirement of unity of invention shall be fulfilled only when there is a technical relationship among those inventions involving one or more of the same or corresponding special technical features. The expression "special technical features" shall mean those technical features that define a contribution which each of the claimed inventions, considered as a whole, makes over the prior art.
- (b) An international or a national stage application containing claims to different categories of invention will be considered to have unity of invention if the claims are drawn only to one of the following combinations of categories:
    - (1) A product and a process specially adapted for the manufacture of said product; or
    - (2) A product and a process of use of said product; or
    - (3) A product, a process specially adapted for the manufacture of the said product, and a use of the said product; or
    - (4) A process and an apparatus or means specifically designed for carrying out the said process; or
    - (5) A product, a process specially adapted for the manufacture of the said product, and an apparatus or means specifically designed for carrying out the said process.
- (c) If an application contains claims to more or less than one of the combinations of categories of invention set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, unity of invention might not be present.
- (d) If multiple products, processes of manufacture or uses are claimed, the first invention of the category first mentioned in the claims of the application and the first recited invention of each of the other categories related thereto will be considered as the main invention in the claims, see **[PCT Article 17(3)(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e363501.html)**  and § **[1.476(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e328736.html)**.
- (e) The determination whether a group of inventions is so linked as to form a single general inventive concept shall be made without regard to whether the inventions are claimed in separate claims or as alternatives within a single claim.

[Added 52 FR 20047, May 28, 1987, effective July 1, 1987; paras. (a) - (e) amended and para. (f) deleted, 58 FR 4335, Jan. 14, 1993, effective May 1, 1993]

# 1.476    Determination of unity of invention before the International Searching Authority.

- (a) Before establishing the international search report, the International Searching Authority will determine whether the international application complies with the requirement of unity of invention as set forth in § **[1.475](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e328679.html)**.
- (b) If the International Searching Authority considers that the international application does not comply with the requirement of unity of invention, it shall inform the applicant accordingly and invite the payment of additional fees (note § **[1.445](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e328174.html)**  and **[PCT Art. 17(3)(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e363501.html)**  and **[PCT Rule 40](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e370760.html)** ). The applicant will be given a time period in accordance with **[PCT Rule 40.3](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e370837.html)**  to pay the additional fees due.
- (c) In the case of non-compliance with unity of invention and where no additional fees are paid, the international search will be performed on the invention first mentioned ("main invention") in the claims.
- (d) Lack of unity of invention may be directly evident before considering the claims in relation to any prior art, or after taking the prior art into consideration, as where a document discovered during the search shows the invention claimed in a generic or linking claim lacks novelty or is clearly obvious, leaving two or more claims joined thereby without a common inventive concept. In such a case the International Searching Authority may raise the objection of lack of unity of invention.

After issuance of the _ex parte_ reexamination order and expiration of the time for submitting any responses, the examination will be conducted in accordance with §§ **[1.104](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e322124.html)**  through **[1.116](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e322826.html)**  and will result in the issuance of an _ex parte_ reexamination certificate under § **[1.570](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e330878.html)**.
- (b) The patent owner in an _ex parte_ reexamination proceeding will be given at least thirty days to respond to any Office action. In response to any rejection, such response may include further statements and/or proposed amendments or new claims to place the patent in a condition where all claims, if amended as proposed, would be patentable.
- (c) The time for taking any action by a patent owner in an _ex parte_ reexamination proceeding may be extended as provided in this paragraph.
    - (1) Any request for such an extension must specify the requested period of extension and be accompanied by the petition fee set forth in § **[1.17(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//eff_20130320_d0e315199.html##eff_20130320_d0e315397)**.
    - (2) Any request for an extension in a third party requested _ex parte_ reexamination must be filed on or before the day on which action by the patent owner is due, and the mere filing of such a request for extension will not effect the extension. A request for an extension in a third party requested _ex parte_ reexamination will not be granted in the absence of sufficient cause or for more than a reasonable time.
    - (3) Any request for an extension in a patent owner requested or Director ordered _ex parte_ reexamination for up to two months from the time period set in the Office action must be filed no later than two months from the expiration of the time period set in the Office action. A request for an extension in a patent owner requested or Director ordered _ex parte_ reexamination for more than two months from the time period set in the Office action must be filed on or before the day on which action by the patent owner is due, and the mere filing of a request for an extension for more than two months from the time period set in the Office action will not effect the extension. The time for taking action in a patent owner requested or Director ordered _ex parte_ reexamination will not be extended for more than two months from the time period set in the Office action in the absence of sufficient cause or for more than a reasonable time.
    - (4) The reply or other action must in any event be filed prior to the expiration of the period of extension, but in no situation may a reply or other action be filed later than the maximum time period set by statute.
    - (5) See § **[90.3(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//ar_d1d85b_16063_379.html##ar_d1d8bc_14276_2b1)**  of this title for extensions of time for filing a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit or for commencing a civil action.
- (d) If the patent owner fails to file a timely and appropriate response to any Office action or any written statement of an interview required under § **[1.560(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e330713.html)**, the prosecution in the _ex parte_ reexamination proceeding will be a terminated prosecution, and the Director will proceed to issue and publish a certificate concluding the reexamination proceeding under § **[1.570](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e330878.html)**  in accordance with the last action of the Office.
- (e) If a response by the patent owner is not timely filed in the Office, a petition may be filed pursuant to § **[1.137](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e323800.html)**  to revive a reexamination prosecution terminated under paragraph (d) of this section if the delay in response was unintentional.
- (f) The reexamination requester will be sent copies of Office actions issued during the _ex parte_ reexamination proceeding. After filing of a request for _ex parte_ reexamination by a third party requester, any document filed by either the patent owner or the third party requester must be served on the other party in the reexamination proceeding in the manner provided by § **[1.248](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e325563.html)**. The document must reflect service or the document may be refused consideration by the Office.
- (g) The active participation of the _ex parte_ reexamination requester ends with the reply pursuant to § **[1.535](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e330405.html)**, and no further submissions on behalf of the reexamination requester will be acknowledged or considered. Further, no submissions on behalf of any third parties will be acknowledged or considered unless such submissions are:

# 1.552    Scope of reexamination in _ex parte_ reexamination proceedings.

- (a) Claims in an _ex parte_ reexamination proceeding will be examined on the basis of patents or printed publications and, with respect to subject matter added or deleted in the reexamination proceeding, on the basis of the requirements of **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e302824.html)**.
- (b) Claims in an _ex parte_ reexamination proceeding will not be permitted to enlarge the scope of the claims of the patent.
- (c) Issues other than those indicated in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section will not be resolved in a reexamination proceeding. If such issues are raised by the patent owner or third party requester during a reexamination proceeding, the existence of such issues will be noted by the examiner in the next Office action, in which case the patent owner may consider the advisability of filing a reissue application to have such issues considered and resolved.
- (d) Any statement of the patent owner and any accompanying information submitted pursuant to § **[1.501(a)(2)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e329877.html##ar_d1d8ad_2a68d_34f)**  which is of record in the patent being reexamined (which includes any reexamination files for the patent) may be used after a reexamination proceeding has been ordered to determine the proper meaning of a patent claim when applying patents or printed publications.

[46 FR 29186, May 29, 1981, effective July 1, 1981; revised, 65 FR 76756, Dec. 7, 2000, effective Feb. 5, 2001; para. (d) added, 77 FR 46615, Aug. 6, 2012, effective Sept. 16, 2012]

# 1.555    Information material to patentability in _ex parte_ reexamination and _inter partes_ reexamination proceedings.

- (a) A patent by its very nature is affected with a public interest. The public interest is best served, and the most effective reexamination occurs when, at the time a reexamination proceeding is being conducted, the Office is aware of and evaluates the teachings of all information material to patentability in a reexamination proceeding. Each individual associated with the patent owner in a reexamination proceeding has a duty of candor and good faith in dealing with the Office, which includes a duty to disclose to the Office all information known to that individual to be material to patentability in a reexamination proceeding. The individuals who have a duty to disclose to the Office all information known to them to be material to patentability in a reexamination proceeding are the patent owner, each attorney or agent who represents the patent owner, and every other individual who is substantively involved on behalf of the patent owner in a reexamination proceeding. The duty to disclose the information exists with respect to each claim pending in the reexamination proceeding until the claim is cancelled. Information material to the patentability of a cancelled claim need not be submitted if the information is not material to patentability of any claim remaining under consideration in the reexamination proceeding. The duty to disclose all information known to be material to patentability in a reexamination proceeding is deemed to be satisfied if all information known to be material to patentability of any claim in the patent after issuance of the reexamination certificate was cited by the Office or submitted to the Office in an information disclosure statement. However, the duties of candor, good faith, and disclosure have not been complied with if any fraud on the Office was practiced or attempted or the duty of disclosure was violated through bad faith or intentional misconduct by, or on behalf of, the patent owner in the reexamination proceeding. Any information disclosure statement must be filed with the items listed in § **[1.98(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e321738.html)**  as applied to individuals associated with the patent owner in a reexamination proceeding, and should be filed within two months of the date of the order for reexamination, or as soon thereafter as possible.
- (b) Under this section, information is material to patentability in a reexamination proceeding when it is not cumulative to information of record or being made of record in the reexamination proceeding, and
    - (1) It is a patent or printed publication that establishes, by itself or in combination with other patents or printed publications, a _prima facie_ case of unpatentability of a claim; or
    - (2) It refutes, or is inconsistent with, a position the patent owner takes in:
        - (i) Opposing an argument of unpatentability relied on by the Office, or
        - (ii) Asserting an argument of patentability.

A _prima facie_ case of unpatentability of a claim pending in a reexamination proceeding is established when the information compels a conclusion that a claim is unpatentable under the preponderance of evidence, burden-of-proof standard, giving each term in the claim its broadest reasonable construction consistent with the specification, and before any consideration is given to evidence which may be submitted in an attempt to establish a contrary conclusion of patentability.

- (c) The responsibility for compliance with this section rests upon the individuals designated in paragraph (a) of this section and no evaluation will be made by the Office in the reexamination proceeding as to compliance with this section. If questions of compliance with this section are raised by the patent owner or the third party requester during a reexamination proceeding, they will be noted as unresolved questions in accordance with § **[1.552(c)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e330613.html)**.

(a) and (b), 49 FR 556, Jan. 4, 1984, effective Apr. 1, 1984; revised 57 FR 2021, Jan. 17, 1992, effective Mar. 16, 1992; heading and para. (c) revised, 65 FR 76756, Dec. 7, 2000, effective Feb. 5, 2001]

# 1.560    Interviews in _ex parte_ reexamination proceedings.

- (a) Interviews in _ex parte_ reexamination proceedings pending before the Office between examiners and the owners of such patents or their attorneys or agents of record must be conducted in the Office at such times, within Office hours, as the respective examiners may designate. Interviews will not be permitted at any other time or place without the authority of the Director. Interviews for the discussion of the patentability of claims in patents involved in _ex parte_ reexamination proceedings will not be conducted prior to the first official action. Interviews should be arranged in advance. Requests that reexamination requesters participate in interviews with examiners will not be granted.
- (b) In every instance of an interview with an examiner in an _ex parte_ reexamination proceeding, a complete written statement of the reasons presented at the interview as warranting favorable action must be filed by the patent owner. An interview does not remove the necessity for response to Office actions as specified in § **[1.111](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e322449.html)**. Patent owner’s response to an outstanding Office action after the interview does not remove the necessity for filing the written statement. The written statement must be filed as a separate part of a response to an Office action outstanding at the time of the interview, or as a separate paper within one month from the date of the interview, whichever is later.

[46 FR 29187, May 29, 1981, effective July 1, 1981; revised, 65 FR 76756, Dec. 7, 2000, effective Feb. 5, 2001; para. (a) revised, 68 FR 14332, Mar. 25, 2003, effective May 1, 2003]

# 1.565    Concurrent office proceedings which include an _ex parte_ reexamination proceeding.

- (a) In an _ex parte_ reexamination proceeding before the Office, the patent owner must inform the Office of any prior or concurrent proceedings in which the patent is or was involved such as interferences, reissues, _ex parte_ reexaminations, _inter partes_ reexaminations, or litigation and the results of such proceedings. See § **[1.985](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e335811.html)**  for notification of prior or concurrent proceedings in an _inter partes_ reexamination proceeding.
- (b) If a patent in the process of _ex parte_ reexamination is or becomes involved in litigation, the Director shall determine whether or not to suspend the reexamination. See § **[1.987](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e335842.html)**  for _inter partes_ reexamination proceedings.
- (c) If _ex parte_ reexamination is ordered while a prior _ex parte_ reexamination proceeding is pending and prosecution in the prior _ex parte_ reexamination proceeding has not been terminated, the _ex parte_ reexamination proceedings will usually be merged and result in the issuance and publication of a single certificate under § **[1.570](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e330878.html)**. For merger of _inter partes_ reexamination proceedings, see § **[1.989(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e335864.html)**. For merger of _ex parte_ reexamination and _inter partes_ reexamination proceedings, see § **[1.989(b)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e335864.html)**.
- (d) If a reissue application and an _ex parte_ reexamination proceeding on which an order pursuant to § **[1.525](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e330142.html)**  has been mailed are pending concurrently on a patent, a decision will usually be made to merge the two proceedings or to suspend one of the two proceedings. Where merger of a reissue application and an _ex parte_ reexamination proceeding is ordered, the merged examination will be conducted in accordance with §§ **[1.171](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e324570.html)**  through **[1.179](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e324899.html)**, and the patent owner will be required to place and maintain the same claims in the reissue application and the _ex parte_ reexamination proceeding during the pendency of the merged proceeding. The examiner’s actions and responses by the patent owner in a merged proceeding will apply to both the reissue application and the _ex parte_ reexamination proceeding and will be physically entered into both files. Any _ex parte_ reexamination proceeding merged with a reissue application shall be concluded by the grant of the reissued patent. For merger of a reissue application and an _inter partes_ reexamination, see § **[1.991](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e335919.html)**.
- (e) If a patent in the process of _ex parte_ reexamination is or becomes involved in an interference, the Director may suspend the reexamination or the interference. The Director will not consider a request to suspend an interference unless a motion (§ **[41.121(a)(3)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e358365.html)**  of this title) to suspend the interference has been presented to, and denied by, an administrative patent judge, and the request is filed within ten (10) days of a decision by an administrative patent judge denying the motion for suspension or such other time as the administrative patent judge may set. For concurrent _inter partes_ reexamination and interference of a patent, see § **[1.993](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e335974.html)**.

    - (2) The period of delay under paragraph (a)(2) of this section for an application is the sum of the following periods, to the extent that the periods are not overlapping:

- (d) The period of delay set forth in paragraph (c)(3) shall be reduced by:
    - (1) Any time during the period of appellate review that occurred before three years from the filing date of the first national application for patent presented for examination; and
    - (2) Any time during the period of appellate review, as determined by the Director, during which the applicant for patent did not act with due diligence. In determining the due diligence of an applicant, the Director may examine the facts and circumstances of the applicant’s actions during the period of appellate review to determine whether the applicant exhibited that degree of timeliness as may reasonably be expected from, and which is ordinarily exercised by, a person during a period of appellate review.
- (e) The provisions of this section apply only to original patents, except for design patents, issued on applications filed on or after June 8, 1995, and before May 29, 2000.

This determination may be delegated to appropriate Patent and Trademark Office officials and may be made at any time before the certificate of extension is issued. The Director or other appropriate officials may require from applicant further information or make such independent inquiries as desired before a final determination is made on whether a patent is eligible for extension. In an application for extension filed in compliance with § **[1.740](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e332100.html)**, a notice will be mailed to applicant containing the determination as to the eligibility of the patent for extension and the period of time of the extension, if any.

# 1.765    Duty of disclosure in patent term extension proceedings.

- (a) A duty of candor and good faith toward the Patent and Trademark Office and the Secretary of Health and Human Services or the Secretary of Agriculture rests on the patent owner or its agent, on each attorney or agent who represents the patent owner and on every other individual who is substantively involved on behalf of the patent owner in a patent term extension proceeding. All such individuals who are aware, or become aware, of material information adverse to a determination of entitlement to the extension sought, which has not been previously made of record in the patent term extension proceeding must bring such information to the attention of the Office or the Secretary, as appropriate, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, as soon as it is practical to do so after the individual becomes aware of the information. Information is material where there is a substantial likelihood that the Office or the Secretary would consider it important in determinations to be made in the patent term extension proceeding.
- (b) Disclosures pursuant to this section must be accompanied by a copy of each written document which is being disclosed. The disclosure must be made to the Office or the Secretary, as appropriate, unless the disclosure is material to determinations to be made by both the Office and the Secretary, in which case duplicate copies, certified as such, must be filed in the Office and with the Secretary. Disclosures pursuant to this section may be made to the Office or the Secretary, as appropriate, through an attorney or agent having responsibility on behalf of the patent owner or its agent for the patent term extension proceeding or through a patent owner acting on his or her own behalf. Disclosure to such an attorney, agent or patent owner shall satisfy the duty of any other individual. Such an attorney, agent or patent owner has no duty to transmit information which is not material to the determination of entitlement to the extension sought.
- (c) No patent will be determined eligible for extension and no extension will be issued if it is determined that fraud on the Office or the Secretary was practiced or attempted or the duty of disclosure was violated through bad faith or gross negligence in connection with the patent term extension proceeding. If it is established by clear and convincing evidence that any fraud was practiced or attempted on the Office or the Secretary in connection with the patent term extension proceeding or that there was any violation of the duty of disclosure through bad faith or gross negligence in connection with the patent term extension proceeding, a final determination will be made pursuant to § **[1.750](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e332354.html)**  that the patent is not eligible for extension.
- (d) The duty of disclosure pursuant to this section rests on the individuals identified in paragraph (a) of this section and no submission on behalf of third parties, in the form of protests or otherwise, will be considered by the Office. Any such submissions by third parties to the Office will be returned to the party making the submission, or otherwise disposed of, without consideration by the Office.

For the purposes of these regulations pertaining to the deposit of biological material for purposes of patents for inventions under **[35 U.S.C. 101](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e302376.html)**, the term biological material shall include material that is capable of self-replication either directly or indirectly. Representative examples include bacteria, fungi including yeast, algae, protozoa, eukaryotic cells, cell lines, hybridomas, plasmids, viruses, plant tissue cells, lichens and seeds. Viruses, vectors, cell organelles and other non-living material existing in and reproducible from a living cell may be deposited by deposit of the host cell capable of reproducing the non-living material.

[Added, 54 FR 34880, Aug. 22, 1989, effective Jan. 1, 1990]

# 1.802    Need or opportunity to make a deposit.

- (a) Where an invention is, or relies on, a biological material, the disclosure may include reference to a deposit of such biological material.
- (b) Biological material need not be deposited unless access to such material is necessary for the satisfaction of the statutory requirements for patentability under **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e302824.html)**. If a deposit is necessary, it shall be acceptable if made in accordance with these regulations. Biological material need not be deposited, _inter alia,_ if it is known and readily avaliable [sic] to the public or can be made or isolated without undue experimentation. Once deposited in a depository complying with these regulations, a biological material will be considered to be readily available even though some requirement of law or regulation of the United States or of the country in which the depository institution is located permits access to the material only under conditions imposed for safety, public health or similar reasons.
- (c) The reference to a biological material in a specification disclosure or the actual deposit of such material by an applicant or patent owner does not create any presumption that such material is necessary to satisfy **[35 U.S.C. 112](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e302824.html)**  or that deposit in accordance with these regulations is or was required.

# 1.807    Viability of deposit.

- (a) A deposit of biological material that is capable of self-replication either directly or indirectly must be viable at the time of deposit and during the term of deposit. Viability may be tested by the depository. The test must conclude only that the deposited material is capable of reproduction. No evidence is necessarily required regarding the ability of the deposited material to perform any function described in the patent application.
- (b) A viability statement for each deposit of a biological material defined in paragraph (a) of this section not made under the Budapest Treaty on the International Recognition of the Deposit of Microorganisms for the Purposes of Patent Procedure must be filed in the application and must contain:
    - (1) The name and address of the depository;
    - (2) The name and address of the depositor;
    - (3) The date of deposit;
    - (4) The identity of the deposit and the accession number given by the depository;
    - (5) The date of the viability test;
    - (6) The procedures used to obtain a sample if the test is not done by the depository; and
    - (7) A statement that the deposit is capable of reproduction.
- (c) If a viability test indicates that the deposit is not viable upon receipt, or the examiner cannot, for scientific or other valid reasons, accept the statement of viability received from the applicant, the examiner shall proceed as if no deposit has been made. The examiner will accept the conclusion set forth in a viability statement issued by a depository recognized under § **[1.803(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e333237.html)**.

Branched sequences are specifically excluded from this definition. Sequences with fewer than four specifically defined nucleotides or amino acids are specifically excluded from this section. "Specifically defined" means those amino acids other than "Xaa" and those nucleotide bases other than "n," defined in accordance with Appendices A through F to this subpart. Nucleotides and amino acids are further defined as follows:
    - (1) _Nucleotides._ Nucleotides are intended to embrace only those nucleotides that can be represented using the symbols set forth in Appendix A to this subpart. Modifications (_e.g.,_ methylated bases) may be described as set forth in Appendix B to this subpart but shall not be shown explicitly in the nucleotide sequence.
    - (2) _Amino acids._ Amino acids are those L-amino acids commonly found in naturally occurring proteins and are listed in appendix C to this subpart. Those amino acid sequences containing D-amino acids are not intended to be embraced by this definition. Any amino acid sequence that contains post-translationally modified amino acids may be described as the amino acid sequence that is initially translated using the symbols shown in appendix C to this subpart, with the modified positions (_e.g.,_ hydroxylations or glycosylations) being described as set forth in appendix D to this subpart, but these modifications shall not be shown explicitly in the amino acid sequence. Any peptide or protein that can be expressed as a sequence using the symbols in appendix C to this subpart, in conjunction with a description in the Feature section, to describe, for example, modified linkages, cross links and end caps, non-peptidyl bonds, etc., is embraced by this definition.

# 1.822    Symbols and format to be used for nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence data.

[Editor Note: This rule is applicable to applications containing a nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence filed prior to July 1, 2022. See §§ **[1.831](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//ar_d35d57_1bdc8_2b8.html)**  through **[1.835](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//ar_d35d57_1be4d_1f4.html)**  for rules applicable on or after July 1, 2022.]

- (a) The symbols and format to be used for nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence data shall conform to the requirements of paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section.
- (b) The code for representing the nucleotide and/or amino acid sequence characters shall conform to the code set forth in appendices A and C to this subpart. No code other than that specified in these sections shall be used in nucleotide and amino acid sequences. A modified base or modified or unusual amino acid may be presented in a given sequence as the corresponding unmodified base or amino acid if the modified base or modified or unusual amino acid is one of those listed in appendices B and D to this subpart, and the modification is also set forth in the Feature section. Otherwise, each occurrence of a base or amino acid not appearing in appendices A and C, shall be listed in a given sequence as "n" or "Xaa," respectively, with further information, as appropriate, given in the Feature section, by including one or more feature keys listed in appendices E and F to this subpart.
- **Note 1 to paragraph (b):** Appendices A through F to this subpart contain Tables 1– 6 of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Handbook on Industrial Property Information and Documentation, Standard ST.25: Standard for the Presentation of Nucleotide and Amino Acid Sequence Listings in Patent Applications (2009).
- (c) _Format representation of nucleotides._
    - (1) A nucleotide sequence shall be listed using the lowercase letter for representing the one-letter code for the nucleotide bases set forth in appendix A to this subpart.
    - (2) The bases in a nucleotide sequence (including introns) shall be listed in groups of 10 bases except in the coding parts of the sequence. Leftover bases, fewer than 10 in number, at the end of noncoding parts of a sequence shall be grouped together and separated from adjacent groups of 10 or 3 bases by a space.
    - (3) The bases in the coding parts of a nucleotide sequence shall be listed as triplets (codons). The amino acids corresponding to the codons in the coding parts of a nucleotide sequence shall be listed immediately below the corresponding codons. Where a codon spans an intron, the amino acid symbol shall be listed below the portion of the codon containing two nucleotides.
    - (4) A nucleotide sequence shall be listed with a maximum of 16 codons or 60 bases per line, with a space provided between each codon or group of 10 bases.
    - (5) A nucleotide sequence shall be represented, only by a single strand, in the 5 to 3 direction, from left to right.
    - (6) The enumeration of nucleotide bases shall start at the first base of the sequence with number 1. The enumeration shall be continuous through the whole sequence in the direction 5 to 3. The enumeration shall appear in the right margin, next to the line containing the one-letter codes for the bases and giving the number of the last base of that line.
    - (7) For those nucleotide sequences that are circular in configuration, the enumeration method set forth in paragraph (c)(6) of this section remains applicable with the exception that the designation of the first base of the nucleotide sequence may be made at the option of the applicant.
- **Note 2 to paragraph (c):** Appendices A through F to this subpart contain Tables 1– 6 of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Handbook on Industrial Property Information and Documentation, Standard ST.25: Standard for the Presentation of Nucleotide and Amino Acid Sequence Listings in Patent Applications (2009).
- (d) _Representation of amino acids._
    - (1) The amino acids in a protein or peptide sequence shall be listed using the three-letter abbreviation, with the first letter as an upper case character, as in Appendix C to this subpart.
    - (2) A protein or peptide sequence shall be listed with a maximum of 16 amino acids per line, with a space provided between each amino acid.
    - (3) An amino acid sequence shall be represented in the amino to carboxy direction, from left to right, and the amino and carboxy groups shall not be represented in the sequence.
    - (4) The enumeration of amino acids may start at the first amino acid of the first mature protein, with the number 1. When represented, the amino acids preceding the mature protein, (_e.g.,_ pre‑sequences, pro-sequences, pre‑pro-sequences, and signal sequences) shall have negative numbers, counting backwards starting with the amino acid next to number 1. Otherwise, the enumeration of amino acids shall start at the first amino acid at the amino terminal as number 1, and shall appear below every five amino acids of the sequence. The enumeration method for amino acid sequences that is set forth in this section remains applicable for amino acid sequences that are circular in configuration, with the exception that the designation of the first amino acid of the sequence may be made at the option of the applicant.
    - (5) An amino acid sequence that contains internal terminator symbols (_e.g.,_ "Ter," "*," or ".," etc.) may not be represented as a single amino acid sequence but shall be represented as separate amino acid sequences.
- **Note 3 to paragraph (d):** Appendices A through F to this subpart contain Tables 1– 6 of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Handbook on Industrial Property Information and Documentation, Standard ST.25: Standard for the Presentation of Nucleotide and Amino Acid Sequence Listings in Patent Applications (2009).
- (e) A sequence with a gap or gaps shall be represented as a plurality of separate sequences, with separate sequence identifiers (§ **[1.823(a)(5)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e333837.html##ar_it_337f1_2121b_346)** ), with the number of separate sequences being equal in number to the number of continuous strings of sequence data. A sequence composed of one or more noncontiguous segments of a larger sequence or segments from different sequences shall be presented as a separate sequence.

|Key|Description|
|---|---|
|allele|a related individual or strain contains stable, alternative forms of the same gene, which differs from the presented sequence at this location (and perhaps others).|
|attenuator|(1) region of DNA at which regulation of termination of transcription occurs, which controls the expression of some bacterial operons; (2) sequence segment located between the promoter and the first structural gene that causes partial termination of transcription.|
|C_region|constant region of immunoglobulin light and heavy chains, and T-cell receptor alpha, beta, and gamma chains; includes one or more exons depending on the particular chain.|
|CAAT_signal|CAAT box; part of a conserved sequence located about 75 bp upstream of the start point of eukaryotic transcription units which may be involved in RNA polymerase binding; consensus=GG (C or T) CAATCT.|
|CDS|coding sequence; sequence of nucleotides that corresponds with the sequence of amino acids in a protein (location includes stop codon); feature includes amino acid conceptual translation.|
|conflict|independent determinations of the "same'' sequence differ at this site or region.|
|D-loop|displacement loop; a region within mitochondrial DNA in which a short stretch of RNA is paired with one strand of DNA, displacing the original partner DNA strand in this region; also used to describe the displacement of a region of one strand of duplex DNA by a single stranded invader in the reaction catalyzed by RecA protein.|
|D-segment|diversity segment of immunoglobulin heavy chain, and T-cell receptor beta chain.|
|enhancer|a cis-acting sequence that increases the utilization of (some) eukaryotic promoters, and can function in either orientation and in any location (upstream or downstream) relative to the promoter.|
|exon|region of genome that codes for portion of spliced mRNA; may contain 5'UTR, all CDSs, and 3'UTR.|
|GC_signal|GC box; a conserved GC-rich region located upstream of the start point of eukaryotic transcription units which may occur in multiple copies or in either orientation; consensus=GGGCGG.|
|gene|region of biological interest identified as a gene and for which a name has been assigned.|
|iDNA|intervening DNA; DNA which is eliminated through any of several kinds of recombination.|
|intron|a segment of DNA that is transcribed, but removed from within the transcript by splicing together the sequences (exons) on either side of it.|
|J_segment|joining segment of immunoglobulin light and heavy chains, and T-cell receptor alpha, beta, and gamma chains.|
|LTR|long terminal repeat, a sequence directly repeated at both ends of a defined sequence, of the sort typically found in retroviruses.|
|mat_peptide|mature peptide or protein coding sequence; coding sequence for the mature or final peptide or protein product following post- translational modification; the location does not include the stop codon (unlike the corresponding CDS).|

The petition should include a statement vouching for the loyalty and integrity of the proposed disclosees and where their clearance status in this or the foreign country is known all details should be given.
- (d) Consent to the disclosure of subject matter from one application under secrecy order may be deemed to be consent to the disclosure of common subject matter in other applications under secrecy order so long as the subject matter is not taken out of context in a manner disclosing material beyond the modification granted in the first application.
- (e) Organizations requiring consent for disclosure of applications under secrecy order to persons or organizations in connection with repeated routine operation may petition for such consent in the form of a general permit. To be successful such petitions must ordinarily recite the security clearance status of the disclosees as sufficient for the highest classification of material that may be involved.

- (a) A petition for retroactive license under **[35 U.S.C. 184](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e304599.html)**  shall be presented in accordance with § **[5.13](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e337449.html)**  or § **[5.14(a)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e337465.html)**, and shall include:
    - (1) A listing of each of the foreign countries in which the unlicensed patent application material was filed,
    - (2) The dates on which the material was filed in each country,
    - (3) A verified statement (oath or declaration) containing:
        - (i) An averment that the subject matter in question was not under a secrecy order at the time it was filed aboard[_sic_], and that it is not currently under a secrecy order,
        - (ii) A showing that the license has been diligently sought after discovery of the proscribed foreign filing, and
        - (iii) An explanation of why the material was filed abroad through error without the required license under § **[5.11](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e337342.html)**  first having been obtained, and
    - (4) The required fee (§ **[1.17(g)](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//eff_20130320_d0e315199.html)**  of this chapter).

- (b) The explanation in paragraph (a) of this section must include a showing of facts rather than a mere allegation of action through error. The showing of facts as to the nature of the error should include statements by those persons having personal knowledge of the acts regarding filing in a foreign country and should be accompanied by copies of any necessary supporting documents such as letters of transmittal or instructions for filing. The acts which are alleged to constitute error should cover the period leading up to and including each of the proscribed foreign filings.
- (c) If a petition for a retroactive license is denied, a time period of not less than thirty days shall be set, during which the petition may be renewed. Failure to renew the petition within the set time period will result in a final denial of the petition. A final denial of a petition stands unless a petition is filed under § **[1.181](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e324913.html)**  within two months of the date of the denial. If the petition for a retroactive license is denied with respect to the invention of a pending application and no petition under § **[1.181](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e324913.html)**  has been filed, a final rejection of the application under **[35 U.S.C. 185](https://mpep.uspto.gov/RDMS/MPEP/print?version=current&href=d0e312906.html#//d0e304634.html)**  will be made.

# 11.1    Definitions.

This part governs solely the practice of patent, trademark, and other law before the United States Patent and Trademark Office.

- (e) _Petition to USPTO Director in disciplinary matters._ A party dissatisfied with any action or notice of any employee of the Office of Enrollment and Discipline during or at the conclusion of a disciplinary investigation shall seek review of the action or notice upon petition to the OED Director. A petition from any action or notice of the staff reporting to the OED Director shall be taken to the OED Director.

Any petition under this paragraph must contain a statement of the facts involved and the point or points to be reviewed and the action requested. Briefs or memoranda, if any, in support of the petition must accompany the petition. Where facts are to be proven, the proof in the form of affidavits or declarations (and exhibits, if any) must accompany the petition. The OED Director may be directed by the USPTO Director to file a reply to the petition to the USPTO Director, supplying a copy to the petitioner. An oral hearing on petition taken to the USPTO Director will not be granted except when considered necessary by the USPTO Director. The filing of a petition under this paragraph will not stay an investigation, disciplinary proceeding, or other proceedings.

The services include:
        - (i) Considering the advisability of relying upon alternative forms of protection which may be available under State law, and
        - (ii) Drafting an assignment or causing an assignment to be executed for the patent owner in contemplation of filing or prosecution of a patent application for the patent owner, where the practitioner represents the patent owner after a patent issues in a proceeding before the Office, and when drafting the assignment the practitioner does no more than replicate the terms of a previously existing oral or written obligation of assignment from one person or party to another person or party.
