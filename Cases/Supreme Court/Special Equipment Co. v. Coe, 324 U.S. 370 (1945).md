dismissing the complaint in a suit under R.S. § 4915 to compel the
Commissioner of Patents to issue a patent.MR. CHIEF JUSTICE STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.This is a suit in equity, brought in the District Court of the
District of Columbia, under R.S. § 4915, to compel respondent, the
Commissioner of Patents, to issue a patent upon an application for
a subcombination of the elements of a machine for which the
inventor had previously filed a patent application. The district
court gave judgment for respondent. The Court of Appeals for the
District affirmed, 144 F.2d 497, 498, and we granted certiorari,
323 U.S. 697. The question is whether the Court of Appeals
correctly rested its decision upon the ground that petitioner did
not intend to make or use the invention, and that the purpose of
seeking the patent was to exploit and protect the combination
invention embodied in the complete machine, of which the
subcombination is a part.Page 324 U. S. 372Ewald, the plaintiff in the district court in whose stead
petitioner, his assignee, was later substituted as a party made
application for a patent on a "fruit-treating apparatus" embracing
the combination embodied in his complete machine. Certain claims of
his application were allowed October 27, 1938, but a patent has not
yet issued. The following year, he made a renewed application for
the subcombination, with which the present suit is concerned. The
specifications of the original application disclosed mechanisms for
automatically performing the successive operations of bobbing
(cutting off the stems), splitting, paring, and coring pears in
preparation for canning or other processing.The original application specified and claimed an apparatus
consisting of two spaced, horizontally mounted turrets or turn
tables, combined with means for continuously, but intermittently,
rotating both in the same direction. Fixed upon, and rotatable
with, the table of the first turret are a plurality of pear
receiving and clamping means, spaced upon the upper surface of the
turntable, adapted to receive and clamp either a pre-split or a
whole pear. At the first intermittent stop, a swinging knife shears
off (bobs) the stem of the fruit, which extends beyond the clamps.
At the next intermittent stop, overhead traveling jaws or clamps
grasp the fruit concurrently with its release from the first clamp
and carry the fruit longitudinally to a point over the second
turntable.As the pear is thus carried from the first turret to a position
over the second, it is split by a fixed vertically positioned knife
straddled by the overhead traveling clamps. As the clamps force the
pear against and past the knife, it cleaves the pear into
substantially equal half sections. The pear sections are then
automatically, successively deposited in spaced cups fixed on the
second revolving turntable. At the next stop of that turntable, the
pear section resting in its cup is peeled by an automaticallyPage 324 U. S. 373operated paring knife. At the next successive stop, the core is
removed from the pear section by an automatically operated coring
device. After completing the coring, the mechanism automatically
separates the pear section from the core and the peeling and
discharges them and the pear section into appropriate
receptacles.In the operation of the machine, whole or split pears may be fed
by hand to the holding and clamping devices on the first turret,
where the pears are bobbed. The whole pear is then split as it is
carried by the overhanging jaws from the first turret to the
second. The peeling and coring of both pre-split and whole pears
are then carried through by the operation of the second turret.The patent application for the complete machine discloses a
highly ingenious device which is said to have achieved a great
advance in the art by increasing the speed and skill with which
pears are prepared for canning, and to result in a great saving of
manpower. The renewed application for the subcombination specifies
and claims the apparatus which we have described, but without the
splitting knife. In the operation of the device thus claimed, the
pears are pre-split by hand. The split sections are placed face to
face in the receiving and clamping means upon the first turntable,
after which the operation, except the splitting by the splitting
knife, proceeds in exactly the same way and accomplishes the same
result as when the splitting knife is present.Additional claims, which are those sued on, covering all the
elements of the combination except the splitting knife were duly
presented to the Patent Office. There, they were rejected as
incomplete, broader than the invention disclosed by the petitioner
in his application, and misleading, and as covering constructions
not contemplated by petitioner's application. Respondent
Commissioner, alleging no prior art against the allowance of the
claims, set up these objections in his answer in the district court
as thePage 324 U. S. 374sole grounds of defense to the suit. The district court
sustained the Commissioner on the grounds assigned by him for
rejection of the claims, and for the further reason that the
subcombination claims did not "combine to produce any useful
result."The Court of Appeals, after observing the operation of
petitioner's subcombination without the cutting knife, as shown by
moving pictures, concluded that the device was far more useful in
its operation than the old method of preparing fruit by hand, and,
without deciding the point, added that it was plausible to say
"that two distinct inventions are disclosed in the
application."Without further examination of the issues raised by the
pleadings, it affirmed the judgment of the district court upon the
new and independent ground that a patent on the subcombination
should not be granted, because of"the dangers of approving a principle which permits a patent
monopoly to be extended by granting claims on distinct inventions,
which the applicant has no intention of exploiting as distinct
inventions."It said:"The record shows that it [the subcombination patent] is to be
used to exploit and protect the patent monopoly of another related
invention, to-wit: the complete machine. There is no intention to
make or license others to make the partial machine, because,
although it is possible to use it without the cutting knife, it is
not designed for such independent use."It thought that the grant of a patent which the patentee has no
intention of exploiting as a distinct invention "for the purpose of
blocking the development of machines which might be constructed by
others" is inconsistent with the constitutional requirement that
the patent grant must "promote the Progress of Science and useful
Arts."We are pointed to no factual basis in the record for the
assertion that petitioner contemplates either the misuse or nonuse
of the combination patent other than thatPage 324 U. S. 375suggested in the court's opinion that the complete machine does
the work better than the subcombination, without the knife, can do
it, and that there would be no reason to manufacture the partial
machine when the complete machine was available. A separate opinion
in which all the judges concurred also states that petitioner"admitted, both on argument and in its brief in the present
case, that its purpose in filing the disputed claims was to
'protect' the main invention, and that it had no intention of
manufacturing the subcombination machine."The reference, as agreed by counsel on the argument before us,
is to a statement in petitioner's brief in the court below that:
"The claims in issue are sought purely to prevent appropriation of
the . . . machine by the obvious expedient of eliminating the
splitting mechanism." It will be observed that this statement of
petitioner is not of a purpose either to suppress the use of the
patented invention or to use it or the patent to exploit or enlarge
the patent monopoly of the complete machine.The court below found support for its conclusion in our
decisions holding that a patentee may not enlarge the monopoly of
his patent by licensing his invention on terms or conditions which
tie to its use the use of material or devices which the licensed
invention does not embrace, whether they are patented,Ethyl
Gasoline Corp. v. United States,309 U.
S. 436,309 U. S. 459;Standard Sanitary Mfg. Co. v. United States,226 U. S.
20, or unpatented.Motion Picture Patents Co. v.
Universal Film Mfg. Co.,243 U. S. 502;United Shoe Machinery Corp. v. United States,258 U.
S. 451;Carbice Corporation American Patents
Development Corp.,283 U. S. 27;Leitch Manufacturing Co. v. Barber Co.,302 U.
S. 458.It is clear that no such case is presented here. We find nothing
in the statement quoted from petitioner's brief in the court below
or in the record to indicate that petitioner proposes to make any
such use of the patent whichPage 324 U. S. 376it now seeks, either by the method of licensing it or otherwise.
The statement expresses only a purpose to prevent appropriation of
the complete machine by the appropriation of a part of it embodied
in the subcombination for which the patent is asked. There is
nothing to suggest any purpose or reason for a purpose to enlarge
the monopoly either of the subcombination or of the complete
machine by tying together their uses. Control of a part could not
be used as a means of enlarging an already acquired control of the
whole. And obviously, licensing the subcombination, which is less
useful than the whole, would not, in any circumstances disclosed by
the record, be a practical means of enlarging the use of the whole.
Failure to acquire control of the whole would be a legitimate
reason for wishing to acquire and retain control of a part if it
involves a patentable invention. And we think it plainly is
legitimate to use a patent on the subcombination as a means of
preventing appropriation by others of petitioner's more important
complete invention which he is using where there is absent, as
there is here, any purpose to enlarge the monopoly of either
invention.A patent on the combination embodied in the complete machine,
without the allowance of the subcombination claims, would not, as
the court below thought, prevent the free use of the
subcombination.Corn-Planter
Patent,23 Wall. 181,90 U. S. 224;Schumacher v. Cornell,96 U. S. 549,96 U. S. 554;Rowell v. Lindsay,113 U. S. 97,113 U. S. 101;Mercoid Corp. v. Mid-Continent Co.,320 U.
S. 661,320 U. S. 668.
Hence, denial of a patent on the subcombination would deprive the
inventor of the benefit of the exclusive right to use the
subcombination in the ways specified by the patent laws. It would
also leave the public free to use, and thus to appropriate, a part,
however important, of the inventor's complete machine, even though
patented.Page 324 U. S. 377If, as we must assume, petitioner has two inventions, both of
which are useful and one of which includes the other in its
entirety, it is evident that the value of the former would be
greatly impaired if the subcombination invention could be freely
used by others.See Deering v. Wingona Harvester Works,155 U. S. 286,155 U. S. 302.
But such appropriation or impairment of the value of the full
combination could be achieved only by appropriation of the
unpatented subcombination, which is, by hypothesis, also a useful
invention entitled to claim the benefit and protection of the
patent laws.The statutes permit, and it is the settled practice of the
Patent Office, many times sustained by this Court, to allow, claims
to a combination and also its subcombinations.Philadelphia, W. & B.R. Co.
v. Dubois,12 Wall. 47,79 U. S. 60;Deering v. Wingona Harvester Works, supra; Leeds & Catlin
Co. v. Victor Talking Mach. Co.,213 U.
S. 301,213 U. S. 318;Altoona Publix Theaters v. American Tri-Ergon Corp.,294 U. S. 477,294 U. S. 487;Mercoid Corp. v. Mid-Continent Co., supra,320 U. S. 667.
The question, then, is whether, without more, the use of the
subcombination patent to prevent appropriation of the complete
machine so infringes any provisions or principles of the patent
laws, or is so contrary to principles governing the award of
equitable relief, as to permit the court to refuse the judgment,
which the statute authorizes, directing that the patent issue.In answering it, the court below assumed that such purpose to
protect the whole invention was to be achieved by complete
suppression of the use of the subcombination invention, and that
the suppression for the protection of the complete machine would
invalidate the patent because it would be contrary to the
constitutional purpose and to the spirit, if not the letter, of the
patent laws. We think both assumptions are unwarranted. Section
4886 of the Revised Statutes authorizes "any person who has
inventedPage 324 U. S. 378. . . any new and useful . . . machine" to "obtain a patent."
The patent grant is not of a right to the patentee to use the
invention, for that he already possesses. It is a grant of the
right to exclude others from suing it. As the statute, R.S. § 4884,
provides, the grant is of the "exclusive right to make, use, and
vend" the invention, and this includes the exclusive right to
license others to make, use, and vend it. By the very terms of the
statute, the grant is nothing more than a means of preventing
others, except under license from the patentee, from appropriating
his invention.It by no means follows that such a grant is an inconsistent or
inappropriate exercise of the constitutional authority of Congress
"to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts" by securing to
inventors "the exclusive Right to their . . . Discoveries." Art. 1,
§ 8 cl. 8. Congress, in the choice of means of promoting the useful
arts by patent grants, could have provided that the grant should be
conditioned upon the use of the patented invention, as in fact it
did provide by the Act of 1832 (4 Stat. 577), authorizing the issue
of patents to aliens conditioned upon the use of the invention,
which provision was later repealed (5 Stat. 117, 125). But Congress
was aware that an unpatented invention could be suppressed, and the
public thus deprived of all knowledge or benefit of it. It could
have concluded that the useful arts would be best promoted by
compliance with the conditions of the statutes which it did enact,
which require that patents be granted only for a limited term upon
an application fully disclosing the invention and the manner of
making and using it. It thus gave to the inventor limited
opportunity to gather material rewards for his invention, and
secured to the public the benefits of full knowledge of the
invention and the right to use it upon the expiration of the
patent.This Court has consistently held that failure of the patentee to
make use of a patented invention does not affectPage 324 U. S. 379the validity of the patent.Continental Paper Bag Co. v.
Eastern Paper Bag Co.,210 U. S. 405;Crown Die & Tool Co. v. Nye Tool & Machine Works,261 U. S. 24,261 U. S. 34;Woodbridge v. United States,263 U. S.
50,263 U. S. 55;Fox Film Corp. v. Doyal,286 U. S. 123,286 U. S. 127;Hartford-Empire Co. v. United States,323 U.
S. 386. No question of nonuse was involved inEthyl
Gasoline Corp. v. United Stares, supra,309 U. S. 459,
on which the court below relied, and it lends no support to the
contention that a patentee may not rightly use his patent as a
protection against misappropriation of his invention, even though
it is not used. There, it was held only that the monopoly of a
patent afforded no defense for violations of the Sherman Act which
the patentee had effected by using his patent to enlarge the patent
monopoly beyond the grant and as a means of increasing the use of
an independent patented invention.Congress has frequently been asked to change the policy of the
statutes as interpreted by this Court by imposing a forfeiture
[Footnote 1] or providing for
compulsory licensing [Footnote
2] if the patent is not used within a specified time, but has
not done so.We have no occasion to consider here whether a better rule
governing the grant of patents could be devised than that
prescribed by Congress, as this Court has interpreted it, or
whether the courts, on equitable principles, should decline to
enjoin patent infringements or decline to compel the issue of a
patent if and when it appears that the patentee or inventor intends
to make no use of the invention. The record neither calls upon nor
permits us to decide any of these questions, for it fails to
establish that petitioner has any such intention. Petitioner's
intended use of the patent to prevent others from appropriating it,
and, by that means, from appropriating an essential part ofPage 324 U. S. 380his complete machine is in no way inconsistent with petitioner's
making other permissible uses of the subcombination patent. In
fact, he does use the subcombination as a part of his completed
machine, and proposes to continue to use it. Execution of his
declared purpose to prevent appropriation of either of his
inventions, whether used separately or together, would not prevent
his licensing others to make, use, and vend the subcombination on
terms which would adequately protect the value of the monopoly of
both his inventions to which he is entitled by the patent laws. And
we cannot say that others, who could not secure a license to use
the complete machine, would not find it profitable to secure, or
that petitioner would not find it profitable to grant, licenses to
use the subcombination which the court below has found to be a
useful device which has advanced the art.The record establishes no intention by petitioner not to use his
invention, and no proposed use of it disclosed or suggested by the
record affords any basis for withholding the grant of the patent.
The judgment below must therefore be reversed, and the cause
remanded to the Court of Appeals for further proceedings in
conformity to this opinion to enable it to consider and decide the
issues raised by the pleadings.See Bates v. United
States,323 U. S. 15,323 U. S. 17,
and cases cited.Reversed.[Footnote 1]See Hartford-Empire Co. v. United States, supra,323 U. S. 433,
n. 26.[Footnote 2]See Hartford-Empire Co. v. United States, supra,n.
27.MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK and MR. JUSTICE
MURPHY concur, dissenting.The right of suppression of a patent came into the law over a
century after the first patent act was passed. In 1886, Judge
Blodgett had ruled that a patentee "is bound either to use the
patent himself or allow others to use it on reasonable or equitable
terms."Hoe v. Knap,27 F. 204, 212. In 1896, that rule
was repudiated by the CircuitPage 324 U. S. 381Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit inHeaton-Peninsular
Button-Fastener Co. v. Eureka Specialty Co.,77 F. 288, 295,
where the court stated that a patentee's"title is exclusive, and so clearly within the constitutional
provisions in respect of private property that he is neither bound
to use his discovery himself, no permit others to use it."That theory was adopted by this Court inContinental Paper
Bag Co. v. Eastern Paper Bag Co.,210 U.
S. 405, decided in 1908. That was an infringement suit.
One defense was that the patentee had suppressed the patent. The
Court held, Mr. Justice Harlan dissenting, that suppression of the
patent was no defense; that the patentee's "right can only retain
its attribute of exclusiveness by a prevention of its violation."Id.,page210 U. S.
430.I think it is time to be rid of that rule. It is inconsistent
with the Constitution and the patent legislation which Congress has
enacted.Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution grants Congress the
power"to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing
for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to
their respective Writings and Discoveries."Of the various enumerated powers, it is the only one which
states the purpose of the authority granted Congress."The Congress is given no general power to issue letters patent
or to reward inventors as it will. An experience with grants of
monopoly in England was fresh in the minds of the Fathers; the
lesson had been underlined in recent differences with the
Crown."Hamilton, Patents and Free Enterprise (1941), p. 152, Temporary
National Economic Committee, Monograph No. 31, 76th Cong., 3d Sess.
The purpose "to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts"
accordingly provides the standards for the exercise of the power
and sets the limits beyond which it may not go. That purpose also
providesPage 324 U. S. 382the guide for the interpretation of patent laws enacted pursuant
to that power.It is a mistake, therefore, to conceive of a patent as but
another form of private property. The patent is a privilege
"conditioned by a public purpose."Mercoid Corp. v.
Mid-Continent Co.,320 U. S. 661,320 U. S. 666.
The public purpose is "to promote the Progress of Science and
useful Arts." The exclusive right of the inventor is but the means
to that end. That was early recognized by this Court.SeePennock v.
Dialogue,2 Pet. 1,27 U. S. 19;Kendall v.
Winsor,21 How. 322,62 U. S.
327-328;Seymour v.
Osborne,11 Wall. 516,78 U. S.
533-534. But thePaper Bagcase marked a
radical departure from that theory. It treated the "exclusive"
right of the inventor as something akin to an "absolute" right. It
subordinated the public purpose of the grant to the self-interest
of the patentee.The result is that suppression of patents has become
commonplace. Patents are multiplied to protect an economic barony
or empire, not to put new discoveries to use for the common good.
[Footnote 2/1]"It is common practice to make an invention and to secure a
patent to block off a competitor's progress. By studying his ware
and developing an improvement upon it, a concern may 'fence in' its
rival; by a series of such moves, it may pin the trade enemy within
a technology which rapidly becomes obsolete. As often as not, such
maneuvers retard, rather than promote, the progress of the useful
arts. Invariably their effect is to enlarge and to prolong personal
privilege within the public domain."Hamilton,op. cit. supra,p. 161. One patent is used
merely to protect another. The use of a new patent is suppressed so
as to preclude experimentation whichPage 324 U. S. 383might result in further invention by competitors. [Footnote 2/2] A whole technology is blocked
off. The result is a clog to our economic machine and a barrier to
an economy of abundance.It is difficult to see how that use of patents can be reconciled
with the purpose of the Constitution "to promote the Progress of
Science and the useful Arts." Can the suppression of patents which
arrests the progress of technology be said to promote that
progress? It is likewise difficult to see how suppression of
patents can be reconciled with the provision of the statute which
authorizes a grant of the "exclusive right to make, use, and vend
the invention or discovery." Rev.Stat. § 4884, 35 U.S.C. § 40. How
may the words "to make, use, and vend" be read to mean "not to
make, not to use, and not to vend"? Take the case of an invention
or discovery which unlocks the doors of science and reveals the
secrets of a dread disease. Is it possible that a patentee could be
permitted to suppress that invention for seventeen years (the term
of the letters patent) and withhold from humanity the benefits of
the cure? But there is no difference in principle between that case
and any case where a patent is suppressed because of some immediate
advantage to the patentee.I think it is time to return to the earlier, and I think the
true, philosophy of the patent system. We should not pass on to
Congress the duty to remove the private perquisites which we have
engrafted on the patent laws. This CourtPage 324 U. S. 384was responsible for their creation. This Court should take the
responsibility for their removal. I would adopt the view ofHoe
v. Knap, supra.In a case like the present (Butterworth v.
Hoe,112 U. S. 50,112 U. S. 61),
as in infringement suits (Morton Salt Co. v. G. S. Suppiger
Co.,314 U. S. 488,314 U. S.
492-494), the Court sits as a court of equity. It should
withhold its aid from a patentee who has employed or plans to
employ the patent not to exploit the invention, but to suppress it
in order to protect another patent or otherwise. [Footnote 2/3]Cf. Ethyl Gasoline Corp. v.
United States,309 U. S. 436,309 U. S. 459.
If that purpose were clear, a patent should not issue in the first
instance. If it has been issued and not cancelled and the patent
has been suppressed, anyone should be permitted to use it, at least
on payment of reasonable royalties. In that way, the constitutional
objective will be more nearly realized -- the product of he
inventive genius of the human mind will be put to work in the
economy.[Footnote 2/1]For illustrations,seeInvestigation of Concentration
of Economic Power, Hearings, Temporary National Economic Committee,
Pt. 2 (1939), pp. 345, 776; Hamilton,op.cit. supra,pp.
46, 47, 59.[Footnote 2/2]The vice is the same as the practice, consistently condemned by
this Court, of writing into the claims broad, general
specifications. As stated by Mr. Justice Bradley inCarlton v.
Bokee,17 Wall. 463,84 U. S.
471-472,"We think it proper to reiterate our disapprobation of these
ingenious attempts to expand a simple invention of a distinct
device into an all-embracing claim, calculated by its wide
generalizations and ambiguous language to discourage further
invention in the same department of industry. . . ."[Footnote 2/3]These situations are to be distinguished from the case of the
inventor who, though he has an expectation of exploiting the
patent, has not yet arranged the necessary financing or, for other
reasons, has not yet been able to go into production.MR. JUSTICE RUTLEDGE, dissenting.I would affirm the judgment. But I do not reach the interesting
and important questions debated by the Court's opinion and my
dissenting brethren. They are of such a character that, in my
opinion, they should not be determined in the absence of a record
presenting facts and issues making this necessary. In this case,
the facts do not so clearly present the issues of "fencing" and
"blocking" that decision upon them is required or appropriate.Those issues were not raised or considered until the case
reached the Court of Appeals. Evidence concerning intent to
suppress was not received in the District Court, andPage 324 U. S. 385petitioner is entitled to its day in court upon that question,
unless it has conceded it. The record, as this Court's opinion
indicates, is not clear that the concession has been made with the
effect of admitting that petitioner had no intention to exploit the
patent. If, as the trial court found, the machine without the
splitting knife would not "produce any useful result," this fact,
together with the assertion of the claims relating to the full
combination, or with it and the concessions apparently made in the
Court of Appeals, might be sufficient to sustain that court's
conclusion that the only purpose of the alleged invention was to
"fence" or "block." But the Court of Appeals expressly rejected the
trial court's finding in this respect, and a showing of motion
pictures here such as took place in the Court of Appeals appeared
to demonstrate conclusively that the machine not only works without
the cutting knife, but produces a highly useful result if the pears
are split before being placed in the machine for bobbing, peeling,
and coring. Whatever foundation might have been found, therefore,
to support the conclusion of intent to fence or block in the
machine's lack of capacity to produce any useful result disappears
from the case.The record, however, discloses another ground which was
considered in the Patent Office and the District Court wholly
sufficient to dispose of the case and requiring affirmance of the
judgment. This was that the claims in issue are too broad to cover
the invention. No one of the claims specifies or indicates that the
pears must be pre-split in order for the invention to be used or to
produce a useful result. With commendable candor, counsel conceded
this in the argument here, and indeed the claims on their face
require the concession. Patents are not to be granted upon claims
which do not accurately describe the invention and all of its
essential features. These claims are stated in language broad
enough to include wholePage 324 U. S. 386pears. Admittedly, the machine will not work without the knife
as to them. In my judgment, therefore, the claims are too broad.
The Patent Office and the District Court so found. The question is
open, and was presented in the Court of Appeals and here.
Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment.Search This CaseGoogle ScholarGoogle BooksGoogle WebGoogle NewsToggle buttonGet free summaries of newU.S. Supreme Courtopinions delivered to your inbox!Enter Your EmailSign Up
